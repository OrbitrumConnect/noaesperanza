    "abstract": "Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) encompasses practices and medical systems developed in China, including contributions from non-Chinese and minorities groups1,2,3. Its official organization began during Qìn dynasty (221-207 BCE)4. Female Chinese doctors existed5 and were necessary6,7 due to gender restrictions that prevented male doctors from treating aristocratic and common women. Idea that womens illnesses should be treated by women reinforced gender-based segregation8. Originally linked to shamanism, medicine was more egalitarian9, reflecting matriarchal society10. However, with rise of agriculture and urbanization, patriarchy became entrenched11. Objective of this paper is recovering names and brief descriptions of Chinese female doctors, from Chinese imperial period, in texts, books and other ancient works, to assist other scholars on subject. Boolean search was conducted in electronic databases using term (ny), referring to physicians, authors or professionals, active in China until 1912, cited in technical works, bibliographies, or collections. Primary databases used were GoogleScholar and ChineseTextProject, but jicheng.tw, chinaknowledge.de, and archive.org were also considered. Shjì12 briefly mentions YìShuò ( -), the oldest, with his general brother. ChúnYúYn (-) appears in QiánHànJì13, LièNChuán14, XjngZájìJunY15, and TàipíngYùln16. Famous for murder of empress. WèiHuáCún ( 251-334), founder of ShàngQng () Taoist sect/school, sometimes not considered \"doctor\"17, contributed to description of physiology of Dntián () in HuángTíngJng18. Described in ZhnGào19, TàipíngGungjì20, YúnJíQQin21, and other Taoist-Buddhist texts. TàipíngGungjì22 and YúnJíQQin23 mention BàoG ( 309-). He married alchemist phycisian GéHóng (), author of ZhuHòuYàoJíFng24 which combines Taoism with medicine, and many prescriptions for moxibustion, and it is quite likely that he developed it together with BàoG25,26. SuíShJngjíZhì27 mentions ZhàoPó (-) author of lost ZhàoPóLiáoLuFng (). HùYn (-) produced one of major classics of internal medicine, HuángtíngNèijngWzàngLiùfBxièTú28. ZhngXioNiángz (-), mentioned in YíJinZhì29, was a surgeons wife who learned medicine from an old wanderer and specialized in beauty formulas. Legends claim she cured an imperial concubine and Emperor RénZng. XíngShì (-), referenced in QíDngyY30, was known for diagnosing pregnancy complications and predicting death through pulse reading alone. YíJinZhì31 and LìshìZhnXinTDàoTngJiànHòuJí32 describe WYuánZhào (-1141) as priestess with transcendental abilities, diagnosing and healing patients without physical contact, and also said to communicate with spirits. TánYnXián ( 1461-1557) has her story in preface to her book NYZáYán ()33,34 from 1511, republished in 1586. She was an aristocrat from a family of medical officials. WànlìYHuòBin35 quickly cites Doctor Péng (-), as an ophthalmologist of astonishing skill. Cited by more recent articles, GùShzho (-) and WángHéngQí (-) author of unpublished BncoTúp ()36, and GùDéHuá (-)37 . ZngYì ( 1852-1927), main representative of Qing (), symbolizes transition of image of Chinese woman. Her work GHunShìCóngsh38 contains bucolic and conservative poems written before the Gngz Incident (), a section on medicine and a section on reformist women's studies. Although it is not the objective of this article, only a few Chinese female doctors have been identified in databases searched, and even fewer with published works. It suggests little documentation on subject. It is hoped that this paper can help researchers in future research.",

    "abstract": "Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) encompasses practices and medical systems developed in China, including contributions from non-Chinese and minorities groups1,2,3. Its official organization began during Qìn dynasty (221-207 BCE)4. Female Chinese doctors, though little known, existed5 and were necessary6,7 due to gender restrictions that prevented male doctors from treating aristocratic and common women. Idea that womens illnesses should be treated by women reinforced gender-based segregation8. Originally linked to shamanism, medicine was more egalitarian9, reflecting matriarchal society10. However, with rise of agriculture and urbanization, patriarchy became entrenched11. Aim is verifying whether characterization of female doctors from Sòng has a pattern, and whether this may be related to development of medicine. Boolean search was conducted in electronic databases using terms (ny) and Sòng Dinasty. Primary databases used were GoogleScholar and ChineseTextProject, but jicheng.tw, chinaknowledge.de, and archive.org were also considered. Sòng marked significant advancements in Chinese medicine, including institutionalization and standardization of medical education12, first official pharmacy13, and gynaecology recognized as specialty14. Despite this, few female physicians are documented, and their histories are brief and vague. Confucianism, which gained prominence during this period15, reinforced gender segregation16, limiting womens access to education. Texts like Model Family (Jifàn) discouraged women from studying or practicing medicine or music17. Confucianization of medicine further marginalized women18. In 990, the Imperial Medical Department restricted medical practice to men, discouraging female doctors, midwives, and healers19,20. Three female doctors are mentioned, and their stories often blend with folklore. ZhngXioNiángz: Mentioned in Records of YíJin (1162)21, she was wife of a surgeon who learned medicine from an old wanderer and specialized in beauty formulas. Legends claim she cured an imperial concubine and Emperor RénZng, earning her title Lady Zhng. XíngShì: Referenced in Rustic Conversations of Eastern Qí ()22, she was known for diagnosing pregnancy complications and predicting death through pulse reading alone. WYuánZhào: Described in Records of YíJin and in collection of biographies TngJiàn True Immortal Body Collection ()23, she was portrayed as a priestess with transcendental abilities, diagnosing and healing patients without physical contact. She was also said to communicate with spirits. Discussion Marginalization of women in education and medicine during Sòng explains why few female doctors were documented, unlike other periods24. Their stories often resemble fables, emphasizing miraculous abilities rather than medical expertise. ZhngXioNiángzs tale mirrors folklore, while XíngShìs pulse-reading skills are exaggerated in works, like Journey to West25. Technical medical texts, such as Classic of Pulse26 and Yellow Emperors Inner Classic27, do not mention such feats. WYuánZhàos story is the most preserved, reflecting Taoist-Buddhist28 influences that recognized womens spiritual and healing potential29. Unlike Confucianism, Taoism maintained a cosmological balance of yn-yáng30, valuing womens roles. During Sòng, depictions of female doctors in few records found emphasized mystical abilities, close to folklore or myth. It suggests that this may reflect their exclusion from orthodox medicine, perhaps due to \"Confusionalization of medicine\" described by Lan12.",

    "abstract": "Background: It is widely acknowledged that research evidence precisam to be translated and disseminated into healthcare in order to maximize the impact of new evidence from clinical research. Objectives: This study aimed to explore the experiences of participants pertaining to knowledge translation (KT) and dissemination in clinical research and to discuss the barriers and facilitators. The purpose of the study was to reduce current knowledge-to-practice gaps, ensure accurate and accessible knowledge reaches the widest audience possible, and to provide informed guidance for individuals and groups. This qualitativo study included 14 participants who took part in an baseado em evidence medicine dissemination competition in 2023. Semi-structured interviews were carried out with participants remotely between December 2023 to January 2024. Participants experiences, perceptions, expectations, and recommendations regarding KT and dissemination in clinical research were explored and transcription data was analyzed using thematic analysis. A total of 3 domains, encompassing 10 themes with 29 associated subthemes emerged. Within the domain of KT, this study discussed themes including priorities when selecting clinical research for dissemination, processing of clinical research content text, expressive presentation of clinical research information, elements of knowledge brokers, and reflective understanding of KT. For the domain of knowledge dissemination, this study delved into themes related to approaches of knowledge dissemination and implementation strategies for knowledge dissemination. Finally, this study considered the domain of the perspectives of knowledge users, addressing themes including resonating with the audience, scientific literacy, and practical utilization for knowledge users. Appropriate and timely dissemination of research evidence is a key priority for many stakeholders, including acadêmicos, clinicians, patients as well as health institutions. Those involved in disseminação research should consider the potential benefits of utilizing social media platforms responsibly, the flexible utilization of artificial intelligence and the need for a multidisciplinary team with diverse backgrounds to jointly facilitate the effective translation and dissemination of clinical research findings, in order to optimize the overall impact of new research.",

    "abstract": "Integrative and Complementary Practices have the primary purpose of promoting individual balance and well-being. Among these approaches, acupuntura and phytoterapia stand out, which use natural and holistic methods. The objective of this study was to identify which ICPs are most effective in reducing pain in patients diagnosed with osteoarthritis. The research was based on a scoping review, carried out in the databases: BVS (Virtual Health Library), Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System on-line (MEDLINE/PUBMED) and EMBASE/ELSEVIER, using the Health Science Descriptors (DeCS): pain/dor crônica, integrative practices and osteoarthritis and their corresponding terms in English. Original articles published between 2020 and 2024 were included. The new Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) checklist was used. The initial search resulted in 1643 records, of which 278 were duplicates, 952 were excluded because they were not empirical cases of intervenção, 219 did not have sufficient information to assess their intervençãoist nature. After a detailed reading, 138 articles were disregarded, resulting in 81 studies on intervençãos in the work context. The research identified acupuntura and phytoterapia as the main PICs applied. Acupuncture, which originated in traditional Chinese medicine, is known for using needles inserted into specific points of the body to stimulate the flow of vital energy and promote balance in the body. This practice stands out as one of the most studied therapies, accounting for approximately 34% of the research conducted. This data may reflect both the broad acceptance of this practice and the accumulation of evidence that supports the continuation of studies. In general, the literature indicates that acupuntura can contribute to the relief of pain caused by osteoarthritis. Phytoterapia uses medicinal plants and their derivatives to prevent and treat various health conditions. This practice accounts for approximately 19% of the studies and therefore also stands out as a relevant field of research. Among the most mentioned species, Miconia albicans and Curcuma longa stand out. The studies suggest the standardization and rigorous validation of these methods as fundamental for integration into tratamentos, in line with the guidelines of the Unified Health System (SUS), which seeks to offer more complete and patient-centered care, transforming the way pain is approached and managed. With the primary objective of promoting the individuals balance and comprehensive well-being, PICs encompass a diverse range of therapies that move away from the traditional biomedical model, valuing the connection between body, mind and spirit. The SUS, in turn, plays a crucial role in this process, by incorporating PICs into its guidelines and offering citizens more complete and humanized care. By embracing the holistic vision of PICs and integrating them into the available therapeutic arsenal, the SUS is transforming the way pain is approached and treated, and paving the way for a future in which health is synonymous with comprehensive well-being.",

    "abstract": "COVID-19 triggered a severe mental health crisis. Emotional disorders, such as ansiedade, affected young people, adults, and also undergraduate students. Auriculoterapia is an effective intervenção for the healthcare of individuals with emotional disorders. It is one of the 29 Integrative and Complementary Health Practices institutionalized in Brazils Unified Health System, recognized as an important healthcare strategy. Needles are the most common devices for administering the intervenção. With technological advancements and the aim of making the technique safer, new application devices have gained prominence, such as low-intensity laser. The reduced invasiveness, compared to needle-based intervenção, is a significant factor that enhances acceptance of laser tratamento. This study aims to compare the efetividade of auriculoterapia using laser and needles in treating ansiedade among undergraduate students in the post-COVID-19 era. A randomized ensaio clínico, approved by a research ethics committee (protocol no. 5.700.107), was conducted with 397 undergraduate students allocated into the \"Needle\" group (NG; n=197) and the \"Laser\" group (LG; n=200). Five auricular acupuntura sessions were performed. Assessments were conducted before and after the tratamento using the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and measurements of heart and respiratory rates. Data were analyzed using Generalized Estimating Equations with a 5% significance level. Anxiety levels were 55.90±0.49 in NG and 55.72±0.46 in LG, decreasing to 53.61±0.57 (p=0.003) and 54.19±0.52 (p=0.028), respectively. There was no statistically significant difference between the groups in the initial (p=0.798) and final (p=0.340) assessments. Regarding heart rate, it was 81.03±1.011 in NG and 81.12±0.81 in LG, decreasing to 80.27±0.93 (p=0.580) and 80.67±0.769 (p=0.691), respectively. No statistically significant difference was found between the groups in the initial (p=0.945) and final (p=0.737) assessments. Finally, respiratory rate was 16.78±0.40 in NG and 16.54±0.19 in LG, decreasing to 16.02±0.20 (p=0.112) and 16.20±0.181 (p=0.213). No statistically significant difference was observed between the groups in the initial (p=0.659) and final (p=0.494) assessments. Both intervençãos were effective in reducing ansiedade levels among undergraduate students in the post-COVID-19 era. No changes in heart or respiratory rates were observed following the intervençãos.",

    "abstract": "Auriculoterapia is an Integrative and Complementary Health Practice rooted in the principles of Traditional Chinese Medicine. Various devices can be used for its application, with needles being the most traditional. With technological advancements, new devices have gained prominence, such as low-intensity laser. Beyond assessing the efetividade of these devices, it is essential to evaluate user satisfaction and the occurrence of adverse reactions to ensure the safe implementation of the intervenção. This study aimed to assess satisfaction with tratamento and the occurrence of adverse reactions in auriculoterapia using needles and laser. A cross-sectional study, approved by an ethics committee (protocol no. 5.700.107), was conducted with 340 undergraduate students who underwent auriculoterapia tratamento using either semi-permanent needles (NG) (n=166) or laser (LG) (n=174). At the end of tratamento, satisfaction was assessed using a five-point Likert scale (1 - extremely dissatisfied to 5 - extremely satisfied), and possible adverse reactions were graded from zero (no discomfort) to 10 (unbearable discomfort). Data were analyzed using Pearsons Chi-square test, Fishers Exact test, and the Mann-Whitney test, with a 5% significance level. Regarding participants' satisfaction levels, 39.6% (n=21) in NG and 41.5% (n=22) in LG were extremely satisfied; 41.5% (n=22) in NG and 37.7% (n=20) in LG were satisfied; 15.1% (n=8) in NG and 17.0% (n=9) in LG were uncertain; no participants in NG and 1.9% (n=1) in LG were dissatisfied; and 3.8% (n=2) and 1.9% (n=1) were extremely dissatisfied (p=0.825). Regarding the frequency of adverse reactions, the most notable were: ear pain  NG: n=46 (86.8%), LG: n=6 (11.3%), p<0.001; ear hyperemia  NG: n=31 (58.5%), LG: n=10 (18.9%), p<0.001; ear pruritus  NG: n=29 (54.7%), LG: n=8 (15.1%), p<0.001; intervenção-related headache  NG: n=19 (35.8%), LG: n=17 (32.1%), p=0.682; ear edema  NG: n=16 (30.2%), LG: n=0 (0.0%), p<0.001; ear scaling  NG: n=12 (22.6%), LG: n=3 (5.7%), p=0.023; enlarged lymph nodes  NG: n=8 (15.1%), LG: n=2 (3.8%), p=0.093; ear flushing  NG: n=0, LG: n=1 (1.9%), p=1.000. Finally, the intensity of adverse reaction symptoms, expressed as mean (standard deviation), was: ear pain  NG: 3.23 (2.44), LG: 0.19 (0.65), p<0.001; ear hyperemia  NG: 1.89 (2.18), LG: 0.23 (0.50), p<0.001; ear pruritus  NG: 2.28 (2.77), LG: 0.28 (0.74), p<0.001; intervenção-related headache  NG: 1.30 (2.39), LG: 1.11 (1.91), p=0.761; ear edema  NG: 0.74 (1.51), LG: 0.00 (0.00), p<0.001; ear scaling  NG: 0.66 (1.55), LG: 0.11 (0.50), p=0.012; enlarged lymph nodes  NG: 0.55 (1.46), LG: 0.13 (0.73), p=0.048; ear flushing  NG: 0.00, LG: 0.02 (0.14), p=0.317. Most participants were satisfied with the tratamentos. The use of laser in auriculoterapia is advantageous when considering the adverse reactions associated with needles.",

    "abstract": "Evidence is accumulating on the health benefits of cold water hydroterapia. Regular cold water exposure has demonstrated health benefits on physical and mental health, yet investigations have been adult-focused. Kneipp cold water terapia stems from a 150-year, holistic, traditional medicine practice with adults and children. The objective is to share lessons from pediatric research with Kneipp cold water terapia and apply this to future cold water investigations and assessments. The Kita Kneipp Study implemented a Kneipp therapeutic concept with kindergartens in and around Berlin Germany in the intervenção arm of a mixed methods, two-arm randomized controlled trial. Qualitative data including expert interviews conducted with kindergarten staff and intervenção-focused ethnographies describe how Kneipp terapia is being applied in a kindergarten-setting. Inductive and deductive content analysis was used to assess how cold water can be implemented and children motivated to engage with cold water in a pediatric setting. Examples are mapped to potential future research with children using cold water. Examples from the Kita Kneipp Study demonstrate how children are motivated through play, observing exemplary peer-behavior, teaching and displaying self-efficacy to take part in promoção da saúde research using cold water. Lessons-learned exhibit how future research can use approaches from traditional medicine to investigate effects of cold water on promoção da saúde in children. Research on the health effects of cold water on children is necessary and potential health benefits must be adequately differentiated. Long-established examples from traditional medicine provide a safe framework for approaching cold water research in children.",

The rats were subjected to daily oral administration of 200 mg/kg bwt of DFP for 7 days with or without single intraperitoneal dose of cisplatin (5mg/kg bwt) administered before (CisB) or at the end (CisE) of DFP. Control rats were provided with water and feed ad-libitum, the rats were sacrificed 24 hours after drug administration. The impact of DFP against Cisplatin-induce hepatic toxicity and histopathologic changes were examined through Hematoxylin/eosin and Periodic Acid Schiff stains, along with various biochemical and redox biomarkers evaluation in the liver tissues. The general body weight gain of the rats also observed. Chromatographic, spectroscopic, and in vitro antioxidative assays were performed to elucidate the phytochemical content, structural features, and antioxidative potentials of DFP The study found that compared with the control rats, cisplatin significantly increased liver injury markers, lipid peroxidation, and nitric oxide levels, meanwhile, it decreased hepatic reduced glutathione, glutathione peroxidase, Catalase, and sodium dismutase activities at p<0.05. DFP significantly improved liver function tests, reduced malondialdehyde, nitric oxide, and raised glutathione. DFP, on the other hand, suppressed these markers and oxidative stress and histology of the liver corroborated the biochemical observations. Additionally, the chemical constituents in DFP showed significant antioxidative and functional properties. The findings suggest that DFP could offer effective protection against cisplatin-induced hepatotoxicity which could be beneficial for combination terapia in cancer tratamento.",

    "abstract": "Pastoral nomadic communities in Somaliland have preserved distinctive maternal health and childbirth practices that reflect centuries of adaptation to harsh environments and social dynamics specific to nomadic life. These traditional practices remain central to maternal and child healthcare, even as modern medical intervençãos increasingly permeate rural settings. The intersection of indigenous knowledge and biomedical approaches raises critical questions about healthcare accessibility, cultural preservation, and community autonomy. This research is motivated by the need to understand how traditional maternal and childbirth practices persist and evolve in the face of modernisation and health system integration. There is a significant gap in both acadêmico literature and policy frameworks regarding the unique healthcare challenges faced by nomadic communities, often resulting in healthcare intervençãos that are poorly adapted to their sociocultural context. This study seeks to fill this gap by documenting, analysing, and interpreting the traditional maternal and childbirth practices of pastoral nomadic women in Somaliland. The primary objective of this study is to document and analyse traditional maternal health and childbirth practices among pastoral nomadic women, examining their cultural significance and their potential compatibility with modern healthcare systems. Additionally, the research aims to identify barriers to healthcare access and explore how indigenous practices can inform culturally responsive healthcare policies. This ongoing study employs a qualitativo research approach, grounded in ethnographic methodology. Fieldwork has been conducted in pastoral nomadic settlements across Somaliland, involving entrevista em profundidades and participant observation. Key informants include midwives, traditional birth attendants, community elders, and women who have experienced childbirth within nomadic settings. Ethnographic interviews are guided by a semi-structured format, allowing for flexibility and depth of inquiry while maintaining consistency across participants. Topics explored include pregnancy beliefs, childbirth rituals, postpartum care, and community health support networks. Special attention is given to rituals such as taraaraysi (spiritual gatherings for pregnant women) and umal-igadh (cultural practices related to lactation and grief after infant loss). Data analysis follows thematic coding, with emerging themes continuously revised as new data is collected. Thematic analysis is complemented by cross-referencing with existing literature on maternal health and indigenous practices. Ethical considerations include obtaining informed consent, ensuring confidentiality, and respecting the cultural integrity of the community. Preliminary findings indicate that traditional practices are deeply rooted in social cohesion and spiritual beliefs, often emphasizing the community's collective responsibility for maternal health. Practices like taraaraysi are not only spiritually significant but also serve as social support mechanisms, fostering solidarity among women. However, nomadic women face critical barriers to formal healthcare access, including geographic isolation, mobility patterns, and social norms that privilege traditional practices over biomedical intervençãos. Tensions arise when modern health policies fail to accommodate traditional knowledge systems, resulting in healthcare gaps and mistrust towards medical professionals This research highlights the importance of preserving indigenous knowledge while building collaborative partnerships between traditional practitioners and biomedical professionals. Recognising the inherent value of traditional maternal health practices not only supports cultural preservation but also contributes to more inclusive and effective healthcare strategies for pastoral nomadic communities.",

    "abstract": "Hospitals are among the most stressful work environments. A situation intensified by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has contributed to burnout, absenteeism, and staff turnover. Stress arises when external demands exceed coping capacity. Mind-body medicine is a proven strategy for enhancing resilience and managing stress. This qualitativo study aims to develop a tailored mind-body medicine intervenção based on the specific needs of hospital employees, serving as a foundation for the SOULFOOD randomized controlled trial, which will examine whether mind-body medicine, nutrition, and complementary self-care strategies can enhance stress resilience. This needs assessment involved five focus groups with hospital employees (n = 21) and one expert group (n = 9) to explore workplace stressors and gather input for the development of a mind-body medicine program in a hospital setting. Using purposive sampling, we recruited participants from various departments, including nurses, physicians, medical technicians, researchers, and administrative staff and from different age groups to ensure a broad range of perspectives. Additionally, an expert group consisting of health insurance professionals and hospital leaders (n = 9) was included to capture insights from key stakeholders. The semi-structured group interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed inductively using Kuckartzs qualitativo content analysis in MAXQDA. Codes were identified and grouped into categories to reveal patterns and topic frequencies. The results were discussed within an team and interpreted. Participants reported significant stress due to workload, staff shortages, interpersonal tensions, and lack of time for self-care. There was interest in practical stress management techniques, conflict resolution training, and promoção da saúde strategies such as exercise and nutrition. Flexibility emerged as a key requirement, particularly for shift workers. Digital and hybrid delivery formats were preferred for their accessibility and convenience. Short, actionable sessions integrated into daily routines were favoured over time-intensive formats. Experts emphasized the importance of institutional support for successful and sustainable implementation. Healthcare workers mentioned the need for a flexible, multimodal program to manage workplace stress. Findings highlighted a demand for practical self-care tools, conflict resolution skills, and preventive health measures. These findings will be integrated in the SOULFOOD intervenção development.",

    "abstract": "Burnout is a global challenge and healthcare professionals are especially at risk. This paper outlines the development of a tailored, baseado em evidence, theory-driven intervenção designed to prevent burnout among hospital-based healthcare professionals (LAGOM program) based on mind-body medicine. During development, particular attention was paid to cooperation and constant feedback loops with various stakeholders, especially with the participants of the intervenção. The LAGOM project has been taking place at Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin and the Immanuel Hospital, Berlin since 2022. To develop, implement and evaluate the burnout prevenção program, we conducted two reviews, interviews, focus groups, workshops, and used modified Intervention Mapping (IM) procedures and the Precede/Proceed logic model. In addition to the multi-professional project team, various advisory boards, including the management of the two hospitals, were involved in the project. The healthcare professionals for whom the intervenção was developed were actively involved in every phase of program development. LAGOM (\"Long-term Health-Related Organizational Concepts with Mind-Body Medicine\") includes 9-week in-person and online sessions covering stress patterns, communication, work culture reflection, self-care, and relaxation and exercise practices based on mind-body medicine. Participation in those sessions is working time. With endorsement from the management board of both hospitals, LAGOM also aims to enhance the work environment within the hospital structures, combining structural and behavioral prevenção.This article details the scientific development process for a burnout prevenção program, illustrating how intervenção development methods can be used to improve the standards for reporting on intervenção development. Employing best practice frameworks, baseado em evidence behavior change techniques and close collaboration with healthcare professionals enhances efetividade of LAGOM. The IM framework proved effective in systematically addressing the complexity of burnout prevenção with mind-body medicine. Its application in other healthcare settings could help develop intervençãos that balance individual and structural components, tailored to the unique needs of each organization.",

    "abstract": "The cytotoxic effects of Viscum album extracts have been extensively documented in recent years. Metabolomic analyses have revealed distinct phytochemical profiles depending on Viscum album host tree species [1]. Additionally, seasonal variations, soil characteristics, and solvent polarity significantly influence the chemical composition of Viscum album preparations [2,3]. Our research aims to identify the bioactive compounds associated with the antitumor properties of Viscum album and to develop innovative pharmaceutical formulations based on mistletoe extracts. Whole fresh V. album plants were harvested from various host trees (Malus domestica, Quercus robur, Quercus petraea, Ulmus carpinifolia, Abies alba, and Pinus sylvestris) across different regions of Switzerland over the past eight years, during both summer and winter seasons, following a standardized protocol. In addition, a lipophilic extract (VALE) from the green organs (leaves and stems) of Viscum album subsp. austriacum was obtained using supercritical CO2 extraction. To improve the solubility and stability of VALE, a self-nanoemulsifying drug delivery system (SNEDDS) was developed [5]. Furthermore, a thermoresponsive hydrogel formulation was created using a dry ethanolic extract of Viscum album from Abies alba for topical transdermal application. The cytotoxic effects of ethanolic extracts, hydrogel, and SNEDDS formulations were evaluated in various tumor (melanoma, leukemia, sarcoma, breast, and prostate cancer) and non-tumor cell lines (fibroblasts, keratinocytes, and kidney cells). Analytical and cellular assays have been performed to evaluate the pharmaceutical parameters and the cytotoxic effects, respectively. The methodologies applied included: 1) Physicochemical characterization: LC-MS-based metabolomics, thin-layer chromatography (TLC), high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), dynamic light scattering (DLS), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). 2) Biological assays: In vitro cell culture, flow cytometry, spectrophotometric assays, and western blotting. The biological assays revealed that ethanolic extracts and hydrogel formulations induced mitochondrial damage, apoptotic cell death, cell cycle arrest, and alterations in glycolytic enzyme activity in tumoral cells [3,4]. Extracts prepared with summer harvests exhibited greater cytotoxic compared to those from winter, particularly in kidney, prostate, and breast cancer cells. The hydrogel formulation, prepared via an efficient, low-energy method, showed favorable characteristics for topical use, including nanometer-sized micelles with low polydispersity index, dermal pH compatibility, non-Newtonian rheological behavior. The SNEDDS formulation was homogeneous, isotropic, and stable, and significantly improved VALE solubility. Oleanolic acid, a pentacyclic triterpene, was identified as a major active VALE compound. Our findings emphasize the significant role of biological and physicochemical factors in the cytotoxic effects of V. album preparations. This research supports the relevance of basic scientific studies in uncovering the mechanisms of action of mistletoe extracts and their pharmaceutical formulations. Ongoing investigations aim to further explore the therapeutical potential of this traditional medicinal plant in oncology and other chronic diseases.",

    "abstract": "The Earth's surface is electrically conductive, with a negative potential. Historically, the term \"grounding\" has been used to describe the strategy of stabilizing electrical networks to protect individuals and equipment from high voltages and electric shocks. Recently, research on \"biological grounding\" has increased, where studies evaluate the effects of direct contact between the body and the Earths surface or via grounding equipment on the skin. These studies highlight physiological alterations and beneficial impacts on dor crônica, sleep, blood pressure, blood viscosity, and non-communicable diseases. Previous studies have shown reductions in inflammation, improvements in pain, and enhanced qualidade de vida. Grounding is a free, accessible method with no associated efeitos adversos. This review aims to consolidate findings regarding groundings effects on oxidative stress, highlighting health improvements and exploring existing hypotheses for these phenomena. This study is a review with Inclusion criteria of articles addressing the studys central question and topics related to the effect of grounding/earthing on oxidative stress, published between 2005 and 2023. The research was conducted using the following databases: PubMed/MEDLINE, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar. Keywords included oxidative stress, grounding, and earthing, using the Boolean operators \"OR\" and \"AND, respectively. The ensaio clínicos reviewed demonstrate positive resultados across a variety of conditions, including: red blood cell aggregation, cortisol levels and sleep, blood pressure, prevenção and tratamento of COVID-19 infections, reduction in vagal tone (associated with mortality risk) in premature infants, and pain management. Hussain et al.(2016) state that the excessive production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS/RNS), generated during the oxidative metabolism process, has been reported to initiate the inflammatory process, leading to the synthesis and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. This relationship between oxidative stress and inflammation justifies the improvement reported for the ensaio clínicos due to the biogrounding. PETEK (2022) wrote that oxidative stress is one of the most important factors in the body's inflammatory processes, due to an imbalance between the reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and elimination in an organism by antioxidant mechanisms. This fact may explain why biogroundind has been used to improve chronic inflammatory diseases. Grounding is a potentially effective, accessible, and low-cost therapeutic tool for combating oxidative stress and improving pain and inflammatory diseases. The most accepted hypothesis suggests that direct or indirect contact with the Earth's surface enables the capture of free electrons, which interact with reactive species (oxidants), preventing the formation of free radicals and acting as antioxidants.",

However, there is a lack of supporting clinical evidence to determine the impact of syndrome differentiation on the efficacy of acupuntura tratamento. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the importance of point selection based on syndrome differentiation by re-analyzing the trials' results in treating primary insomnia with acupuntura. We systematically searched 9 databases for eligible trials. Two authors extracted data independently from citations, intervençãos, and resultados. Since the \"tratamento acupuntura\" and \"control acupuntura\" data compared in this study were from different trials, we matched the data in a 1:1 ratio and minimized heterogeneity between the paired groups. Matching factors included age, sex ratio, and the baseline Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score. Meta-analyses were performed using Revman 5.4 software. Effect estimation presented continuous data with a mean difference (MD) with a 95% confidence interval (CI). Besides the recombination indirect comparison, STATA 15.0 was used for network metanálise of all included trials. We included a total of 172 trials. After matching, 19 recombinational studies were established. Meta-analysis showed that PSQI scores in the syndrome differentiation group were slightly lower than the non-syndrome differentiation group (MD=-1.98, 95%CI [-3.52, -0.44], P=0.01). Network metanálise of all included trials showed no statistical difference in acupoints selection between syndrome and non-syndrome differentiation (MD=-0.12, 95% CI [-3.85, 3.62]). However, acupoint selection based on syndrome differentiation (72.6%) ranks higher than acupoint selection based on non-syndrome differentiation (57.2%) according to SUCRA curves. Limitations included high heterogeneity from indirect comparisons and bias risks in original trials. Previous studies reported inconsistent results, potentially due to conflicts between standardized trial designs and individualized SD principles. Future research should adopt adaptive trial designs (e.g., sequential multiple-assignment RCTs) to better evaluate dynamic acupuntura protocols while balancing methodological rigor and clinical authenticity. After matching recombination and network metanálise, we found a minor statistical difference in acupoints selection between syndrome and non-syndrome differentiation in the tratamento of insomnia. However, due to the higher risk of bias in indirect comparisons and the insignificant clinical significance of the effect values indicating between-group differences, existing evidence has not yet shown that acupuntura based on syndrome differentiation is more effective in treating insomnia than non-syndrome differentiation.",

The protocol of this study was registered on PROSPERO ( https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/display_record.phpRecordID=474638). We systematically searched 9 databases for RCTs of acupuntura for primary insomnia.The conventional acupuntura group in the original study with a frequency of less than or equal to three times per week was defined as the \"experimental acupuntura group\", while the conventional acupuntura group with a frequency of more than or equal to four times per week was defined as the \"control acupuntura group\". The \"experimental acupuntura group\" and the \"control acupuntura group\", which were very similar in terms of gender, age, acupuntura tratamento, acupuntura duration, and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) type, were recombinantly matched in a 1:1 ratio, and the efficacy of the two groups was compared. Meta-analyses were performed using RevMan 5.4 software.Studies finally included were analyzed using network metanálise, which was conducted with StataSE15.0 software. The effect estimation is represented by continuous data, which indicates the mean difference (MD) in the PSQI scores, along with a 95% confidence interval (CI). The study included 157 trials. Direct comparison showed high-frequency acupuntura (5 times per week) significantly improved PSQI scores compared to low-frequency (3 times per week) (MD=-1.46, 95%CI -2.14 to -0.78). However, paired analysis did not found difference between acupuntura frequency in treating insomniaS according to PSQI scores (MD=0.2, 95%CI -0.77 to 1.17), similar results were found in network metanálise (MD = -1.46, 95%CI -4.84 to 1.92). This study found no significant difference in efficacy for primary insomnia between acupuntura frequencies of 3 versus 4 weekly sessions, aligning with prior relevant research but contrasting pain-related conditions where higher frequency often enhances resultados. While matching methods and network metanálise strengthened comparability, evidence certainty remains limited by potential confounding factors and insufficient tratamento duration in some trials. Future studies should prioritize dose-effect designs for frequency-sensitive conditions like dor crônica disorders. Clinically, practitioners may tailor acupuntura frequency to individual needs without compromising efficacy, supporting flexible tratamento personalization for insomnia. The results of the matched studies and network metanálise suggest that there may be no difference in the efficacy of acupuntura between those treated with a frequency of 3 times per week and those treated with a frequency of 4 times per week for primary insomnia.",

Traditional medicines is present across all the regions around the world and this term has been adopted an adapted to the local context and it is referred to as complementary medicine. Descrição: Descrição: The present work reflects a characterization of traditional complementary and integrative medicines (TCIM) within the National Program of Public Health in Cuba, the objectives of the work are: to provide elements of the use of TCIM at the different levels of the health system, the training program for TCIM use, in addition to the regulatory framework that supports the modalities of TCIM in Cuba. Resolution 381/2015 from Public Health Ministry, approves the use of traditional and complementary medicines in Cuba and its integration in the Health System as TCIM, besides that, national pharmacovigilance data base was used in order to get information about the consumption and frequencies of adverse events of TCIM. Results, In Cuba there are 11 TCIM modalities approved, which are present in 3 levels of healthcare, the primary, secondary and tertiary level, moreover, there is an Essential List of the TCIM product. The data from the Ministry of Health reflects that more than 80% of the population consumes these products, the national Pharmacovigilance network shows that the adverse events associated with use have been mild. Moreover, Cuba has an acadêmico program for studying the modalities and regulatory framework, which ensure the quality, segurança and efetividade of TCIM products. Some of the current challenges are: lack of enough scientific research and reliable methods for standardization. Conclusions: In general, health systems must ensure the use of traditional and complementary medicines with quality, segurança and efficacy.",

    "abstract": "The Amazon, the world's largest tropical forest, is experiencing severe degradation due to human activities, including agribusiness, mining, and deforestation. Over the past two centuries, significant climate variations have led to extreme weather events such as heatwaves, droughts, and wildfires across all the region. During the dry season (March/April to October), pollutant concentrations from wildfires often exceed the World Health Organization (WHO) acceptable levels. Indigenous communities in the brazilian Legal Amazon are particularly vulnerable to the efeitos adversos of biomass combustion. An ecological study design was used to compare different time periods and perform spatial analysis across cities. Secondary data from the Hospital Admission System were analyzed to assess respiratory health resultados in both Indigenous and non-Indigenous populations. Monthly remote sensing data on particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5) were classified according to the WHO air quality standards. Generalized Mixed Effects Models, with a negative binomial error distribution, were fitted using RStudio Version 2023.12.0+369 and the glmmTMB package. Statitiscal Wald Test was applied followed by overall rates. This analysis assessed the impact of PM2.5 exposure on respiratory resultados, adjusting for regional variations and potential confounders in 580 cities. Spatial images capturing wildfires and deforestation were used to illustrate anthropogenic actions over time. Ethics committee approval was not required as the study used publicly available and secondary data. This study investigates the impact of wildfire exposure, as measured by PM2.5, on respiratory diseases among Indigenous populations in the Brazilian Amazon from 2010 to 2018. The analysis showed clear seasonal patterns affecting PM2.5 levels and respiratory diseases in the Brazilian Amazon. PM2.5 concentrations peak towards the end of the year, same period as the dry season marked by a significant drop in rainfall from June to September. Rainfall at the beginning of the year is high but decreases sharply mid-year, with an exceptional rainfall peak recorded in 2011. Minimum temperatures drop notably in June and July, typically ranging between 18°C and 22°C, except for 2018, which showed higher temperatures throughout most of the year. Respiratory disease cases peak around mid-year, slightly lagging behind PM2.5 peaks. Data gaps, especially in 2019 due to over 50% missing data in fire-affected regions like Pará and Amazonas, highlight challenges in monitoring. Overall, PM2.5 levels during wildfire seasons exceed WHO guidelines, disproportionately impacting Indigenous communities and stressing the need for improved environmental and saúde pública policies. The study highlights a strong connection between prolonged exposure to PM2.5 and respiratory diseases in Indigenous communities, reflecting the severe environmental degradation in the Amazon and the limited efetividade of Brazils current wildfire and conservation policies. It underscores the urgent need for targeted saúde pública intervençãos and stronger national and international actions to reduce pollution, deforestation, and climate impacts.",

    "abstract": "Among university students, there has been an observed increase in cases of ansiedade and stress, worsening sleep quality with altered patterns, as well as a rise in the use of medications  a scenario intensified during the COVID-19 pandemic and sustained after the return to in-person acadêmico routines. In this context, non-pharmacological strategies stand out as viable and safe alternatives, among them Auriculoterapia (A) and Flower Therapy (FT). The objective of this study was to analyze the efficacy of auriculoterapia and flower terapia in managing ansiedade and promoting and maintaining sleep quality among university students at a public university in Brazil. This is a preliminary analysis of a randomized ensaio clínico with a crossover design, conducted with university students symptomatic for ansiedade and sleep quality alterations, evaluated through the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Participants were randomly assigned to two groups: the A/FT group initially received auriculoterapia followed by flower terapia, while the FT/A group initially received flower terapia followed by auriculoterapia. Each intervenção lasted four weeks, totaling eight weeks of follow-up. Data were analyzed statistically using linear regression via generalized linear models to assess the presence of a carry-over effect. When a carry-over effect was observed, comparisons between groups were conducted considering only the first evaluation period using the Mann-Whitney test. In cases where no carry-over effect was detected, mixed-effects linear models were used for group comparisons. A total of 45 students participated. Results indicated intragroup reductions in ansiedade scores and improvements in sleep quality. In the A/FT group, PSQI scores varied from 7.45 to 6.18; STAI-state scores from 49.09 to 46.73; and STAI-trait scores from 46.27 to 46.18. In the FT/A group, PSQI scores varied from 6.10 to 6.00; STAI-state from 48.50 to 42.60; and STAI-trait from 43.00 to 40.20. The carry-over effect was statistically significant only for the STAI-trait (p = 0.0215). Direct comparisons between groups, however, did not show statistical significance. In conclusion, the preliminary results suggest that both intervençãos were well tolerated, with no reports of adverse events, indicating good segurança. Improvements in the measured resultados were observed within groups, particularly in the group that started with Flower Therapy. However, the absence of statistical significance between groups, the presence of a carry-over effect, and the lack of effect size measures limit the interpretation of clinical efficacy. Thus, although the findings are promising, it is not possible to affirm the conclusive efetividade of the intervençãos. Future studies with larger samples, control of residual effects, and clinical relevance analysis are recommended to deepen the understanding of the effects of these integrative practices on the mental health of university students.",

    "abstract": "Bach flower terapia is an integrative practice comprising 38 highly diluted, odorless liquid extracts of flowers and plants, that aims to address emotional disturbances. The nursing profession, marked by its high demands and specialized requirements, poses a significant risk for the development of physical and mental health disorders among its practitioners. Mood serves as an indicator of overall psychological well-being, with positive mood states being linked to favorable health resultados in both physical and mental health domains. The study aims to compare the efetividade of Bach flower terapia with a placebo in improving mood states among stressed nursing workers. Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pragmatic ensaio clínico. The sample consisted of 75 nursing professionals working in primary healthcare centers in São Paulo, Brazil. Data were collected via electronic form using a clinical sociodemographic questionnaire, and the Brunel Mood Scale (BRUMS). The Experimental group received a standardized formula containing the essences Cherry Plum, Elm, Hornbeam, Olive, Star of Bethlehem, Walnut, and White Chestnut, diluted in a 30% alcoholic vehicle; the Placebo group received only the 30% alcoholic diluent. Participants were instructed to intake four drops of the bottles content, four times a day, for four weeks. The study was approved by a research ethics committee. Paired samples T-tests showed statistically significant results (p < 0.05) in both groups for mood states pre- and post-tratamento. However, Cohens d effect size was more prominent in the Experimental group, in the following domains: Depression  Experimental, d = -0.79 (medium); Placebo, d = -0.42 (small). Confusion  Experimental, d = -0.45 (small); Placebo, d = -0.18 (trivial); Anger  Experimental, d = -0.56 (medium); Placebo, d = -0.38 (small). The utilization of a standardized formula, combined with the relatively short intervenção duration, may have been a limiting factor in achieving optimal resultados. The positive resultados observed in this study can be attributed to the therapeutic effects of specific flower essences, namely: White Chestnut, for Confusion; Cherry Plum, for Anger; and Star of Bethlehem, for Depression. The Walnut essence helps maintain emotional stability and personal autonomy, being indicated for people whose emotional states are subject to external influences. Although both Experimental and Placebo groups showed similar effects on mood states, Bach flower terapia demonstrated a slightly better effect size in Confusion, Anger, and Depression domains, compared to the placebo.",

Considering the growing impact of economic instability on emotional balance, this study aimed to reflect on the perceptions of well-being reported by individuals experiencing financial insecurity, based on clinical practice using the Saint Germain flower essences: Abundância, Boa Deusa, Boa Sorte, Canela, Chapéu de Sol, Lírio da Paz, Patiens, Populus Panicum, São Miguel, Tuia, Lótus Azul, and Poaia Rosa. The clinical follow-up took place between 2016 and 2019, involving 40 participants (n=20 in Brazil and n=20 in England), organized into three evaluation stages. Initially, a formula containing ten Saint Germain flower essences was administered: Abundância, Boa Deusa, Boa Sorte, Canela, Chapéu de Sol, Lírio da Paz, Patiens, Populus Panicum, São Miguel, and Tuia. After three months of continuous use, participants began using a new combination with Abundância, Boa Sorte, Lótus Azul, Patiens, and Poaia Rosa. The second evaluation was conducted at the end of six months of floral intervenção. Two years after the beginning of the process, a third follow-up was carried out to assess the persistence of the reported perceptions. Data were organized in Excel spreadsheets, based on participants narratives collected through an author-developed clinical instrument applied at all stages of the therapeutic journey. Inclusion criteria considered adults reporting emotional distress associated with financial instability, such as indebtedness, professional insecurity, and difficulty in financial planning. Descriptive analysis of the data revealed subjective reports of improved emotional balance, reorganization of daily routines, and increased coping capacity, in both the Brazilian and British contexts, despite sociocultural differences. The study followed the ethical principles established by Resolution No. 466/12 of the Brazilian National Health Council. All participants voluntarily signed the Consentimento Informado Form (TCLE). The results indicated significant improvement in emotional indicators in both countries. In Brazil, participants reported constant fear, feelings of powerlessness, and difficulties in financial management. In England, amidst the uncertainties of Brexit, they mentioned professional insecurity, family tensions, and decision-making blocks. After continuous use of the flower essences, greater emotional stability, reorganization of routines, and improved coping skills were observed. Despite cultural and economic differences, emotional patterns showed similarities between the groups, suggesting that the Saint Germain flower essences may act on universal cores of imbalance related to insecurity and financial instability. Future studies with more robust designs, validated instruments, and larger samples are recommended to deepen the investigation of the mechanisms of action of the Saint Germain flower essences in promoting emotional balance and to strengthen their scientific basis.",

    "abstract": "Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) causes pain, disability and reduced qualidade de vida in adult and elderly populations, in addition to its major effect on productivity and enormous burden on the healthcare system. Tuina terapia (Tuina) is commonly utilized for managing knee osteoarthritis (KOA), yet the available evidence is limited. To evaluate the efetividade of Tuina compared to widely-accepted manual physical terapia (mPT) for patients with KOA. Between Oct 2019 and Oct 2021, patients with KOA (Kellgren-Lawrence score II or III) were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive Tuina or mPT, with eight 20-minute sessions over 3 weeks. Assessments were performed at baseline, week 4, 8, and 16. The primary resultado was the change of total Western Ontario and McMaster University Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) from baseline to week 4. Secondary resultados included WOMAC subscales, knee pain measures, performance-based tests, quality-of-life measures, and segurança assessments. Patients, evaluators, and statisticians were blinded to tratamento group assignment. All main analyses were by intention-to-treat. Of the 140 patients allocated to Tuina or mPT, 127 completed the tratamento. There was significant intervenção × time interaction observed in the WOMAC-total (F(2, 266) = 3.87, P = 0.02), there was no statistically significant between groups at week 4 (between-group difference: 1.00, 95%CI: 5.33 to 3.33, P = 0.79, Bonferroni correction). By week 8, Tuina showed significantly consistent improvement compared to mPT (between-group difference: 4.33, 95%CI: 8.34 to 0.31, P = 0.03, Bonferroni correction), whereas there were no statistically significant differences between groups at week 16 (between-group difference: 0.74, 95%CI: 3.67 to 5.15, P = 0.37, Bonferroni correction). Most secondary resultados showed no significant between-group differences, except for the Timed Up and Go Test Time favoring mPT (0.94, 95%CI: 0.03 to 1.85, P = 0.04). No serious adverse events occurred. One patient in the mPT group took the medication and no patients received other therapies for KOA. Tuina produced beneficial efetividade similar to mPT in treating KOA. Trial registration: NCT03966248, Registered on 29/05/2019, ClinicalTrials.gov.",

    "abstract": "Ditan Qingnao Granules (DQG) are produced by Tasly Pharmaceutical Group Co., Ltd. They are composed of traditional Chinese herbs such as Acanthopanax, Qingmengshi, and Fritillaria. In Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), DQG is used to treat manic-type schizophrenia, especially when strong sedatives are ineffective. We conducted this study to evaluate the efficacy and segurança of DQG as an adjunct to risperidone for negative symptoms of schizophrenia and its effect on improving Phlegm-Dampness Obstruction (PDO) syndrome. Methods: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in China. A total of 134 patients aged 18-70, meeting International Classification of Diseases, 11th Revision (ICD-11) criteria for schizophrenia and TCM criteria for PDO syndrome, were enrolled. After a washout period, participants were randomized to receive either DQG (10g BID) plus risperidone (1mg BID) or placebo plus risperidone for 6 weeks. Blinding was maintained for patients, investigators, and resultado assessors. The primary resultado was the change in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score from baseline to week 6. Secondary resultados included PANSS negative scores, TCM symptom scores, and segurança assessments. Analyses included Intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis, Per-Protocol Set (PPS), and Safety Set (SS). ITT was used as the primary analysis and PPS as the sensitivity analysis. Descriptive statistics included mean, standard deviation, median, interquartile range, frequency, and count. Group comparisons were conducted using t-tests, Wilcoxon rank-sum tests, chi-square tests, or Fisher's exact test. Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) were used for repeated measures analysis. Of the 134 randomized patients, 126 completed the trial, with a dropout rate of 5.97%. Baseline characteristics were comparable between groups. By week 6, the ITT analysis showed a significantly greater reduction in PANSS total score in the intervenção group compared to the control group (Median: 45 vs 48, Z=3.8486, P=0.0498). The intervenção group also demonstrated significantly greater improvement in PANSS negative score (Median: 14 vs 15, Z=4.8713, P=0.0273) and TCM symptom score (Mean: 23.93 vs 30.13, t=2.85, P=0.0050). No significant difference was found in PANSS positive scores. The GEE analysis revealed significant group (P=0.0004), time (P<0.0001), and group*time interaction (P=0.0078) effects for PANSS total score, indicating a superior and sustained improvement pattern in the intervenção group throughout the tratamento period (significantly lower scores at weeks 2, 4, and 6, P<0.05). Sensitivity analysis of the PPS dataset confirmed the stability of these results. Both tratamentos were well tolerated. DQG combined with low-dose risperidone significantly improved overall psychopathology and negative symptoms, as well as TCM syndrome manifestations, compared to risperidone plus placebo. This combination terapia effective and safe for patients with schizophrenia and predominantly negative symptoms.",

According to the symptoms and needs of different severity, there have been relevant stepped intervenção clinical pathways in foreign countries, but they may not be applicable to China. After the core group determined the problems to be solved in this study, extensive evidence was collected, including guidelines, systematic evaluations, etc., and multidisciplinary experts were invited to reach a consensus on the basis of Delphi questionnaires to form this path. From January 2023 to March 2023, 78 experts were invited, out of which 40 responded and took part in this study, through which a stepped clinical pathway of conservative tratamento for LSS with both TCM and Western medicine was constructed. There were four rounds of survey, with 40 questionnaires distributed and recovered in each round. The active coefficient for all four rounds was 100%. The pathway included grading criteria for LSS, stepped tratamento to which intervençãos were matched, resultado evaluation indicators, evaluation interval, criteria for tratamento upgrade/downgrade, instructions on some TCM intervençãos, recommended terapia combinations, as well as the application of some therapies, such as analgesics. This study fully considers China 's national conditions and the objects of use, and forms a unique step-by-step clinical pathway for conservative tratamento of integrated traditional Chinese and Western medicine. It is used for the implementation of basic medical institutions. According to the individual differences of patients, combined with the values and wishes of patients, doctors and patients jointly choose the most appropriate conservative tratamento strategy that meets the preferences of patients. The implementation of this clinical pathway in primary healthcare institutions across diverse regions of China also faces several challenges, including uneven technical capabilities, resource shortages, low motivation among healthcare personnel, and poor patient compliance. These barriers can be effectively addressed through pathway-specific training programs, enhanced resource allocation, and strengthened oversight mechanisms, thereby improving the quality and efficiency of atenção primária services.",

    "abstract": "Dysmenorrhea, characterized by painful menstruation, is a common condition affecting a significant proportion of women worldwide, often impairing daily functioning and qualidade de vida. Current management strategies include pharmacological tratamentos such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and oral contraceptives, which can be associated with efeitos adversos or inadequate efficacy in some patients. Light terapia has emerged as a promising non-invasive tratamento option for various pain-related conditions, potentially offering analgesic effects through mechanisms such as improved blood flow, reduced prostaglandin levels, and smooth muscle relaxation. Despite its potential, the efetividade of light terapia in alleviating dysmenorrhea remains unclear. This revisão sistemática and metanálise aim to assess both the efficacy and segurança of light terapia in managing dysmenorrhea. A comprehensive search was conducted across 12 databases, including PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, Allied and Complementary Medicine Database (AMED), APA PsycINFO, CINAHL Complete, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Chinese Scientific Journals Database (VIP), WanFang Data, Research Information Sharing Service (RISS), and Oriental Medicine Advanced Searching Integrated System (OASIS), for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published until February 2025 that evaluated the efetividade of light terapia for dysmenorrhea. Inclusion criteria were assessed independently, and inconsistencies were resolved by consensus. Data were extracted on pain intensity, tratamento duration, and light terapia parameters. The methodological quality of the included studies was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool version 2 (RoB2). A metanálise was performed to estimate the pooled effect size of light terapia on pain reduction using a random-effects model. Twelve studies, including nine randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with a total of 645 participants, met the inclusion criteria. Most intervençãos involved low-level laser terapia (LLLT) (n=6), while others used high-intensity laser terapia (HILT) (n=2) or polarized light (n=1). A metanálise of three RCTs found that LLLT significantly reduced pain at 12 weeks compared to a sham tratamento (mean difference (MD) = -4.02, 95% CI: -7.21 to -0.82; p = 0.01). LLLT also resulted in significantly greater pain relief than oral contraceptives over the same period (MD = 0.91, 95% CI: 0.49 to 1.33; p < 0.0001). The risk of bias was concerning in most studies, and efeitos adversos were minimal and transient. No serious adverse events were reported across the trials. The findings suggest that light terapia may offer a non-pharmacological alternative for pain management in dysmenorrhea, with minimal side effects. Further well-designed, large-scale randomized controlled trials with standardized light parameters are needed to confirm these findings and determine the optimal tratamento protocol for clinical use.",

    "abstract": "As life expectancy rises, facial rejuvenation has gained significance. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of body and facial acupuntura on reducing frown lines in women aged 30-59 in Mashhad, Iran. In this double-arm randomized wait-list controlled trial, 72 participants were randomly assigned to either an intervenção group, receiving facial and body acupuntura twice weekly for six weeks, or a control group with no tratamento. The primary resultado was assessed using the Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (GAIS) based on standardized photographs. Secondary resultados included the Subject Satisfaction Scale (SSS) and Quality of Life (QOL) scores. Measurements were taken at three time points: week 0 (pre-tratamento), week 7 (post-tratamento), and week 12 (follow-up). At week 7, 63% of the intervenção group showed reduced frown lines at rest, and 72% during maximum frowning, significantly outperforming the control group. The improvements observed in the intervenção group persisted at week 12 with 68.6% at rest and 57.2% at maximum frown. The SSS indicated that 72.2% and 62.9% of the intervenção group were satisfied with their frown lines at weeks 7 and 12, respectively. Notable QOL improvements in social functioning were observed in intervenção group compared to control group at both weeks 7 and 12. No serious efeitos adversos were reported; minor bleeding occurred in 4.86% of tratamento sessions, resulting in bruising in 0.69%. This study demonstrates that facial and body acupuntura is an effective and safe method for reducing frown lines.",

    "abstract": "Vitiligo remains a challenging condition to treat. Fire needle terapia, a traditional Chinese medicine technique, has potential as an alternative therapeutic strategy. However, rigorous evidence on its efficacy is lacking. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and segurança of fire needle terapia, alone and combined with topical tacrolimus ointment, for non-segmental stable vitiligo. In this 6-month randomized self-controlled trial, 35 vitiligo patients were enrolled, providing three similar lesions each. Lesions were randomly allocated to receive fire needle monoterapia, 0.1% tacrolimus ointment monoterapia, or combined fire needle and tacrolimus ointment terapia. Main resultado was change in vitiligo surface area. In total, 29 patients completed the 6-month follow-up. The combination terapia group showed significantly greater reductions in vitiligo surface area compared to monoterapia groups starting at months 4 and 5. By the end of the study, combination terapia resulted in remarkably higher repigmentation responses, with 89.7% of lesions showing at least mild (25%) repigmentation and 51.7% showing good (50%) repigmentation. This significantly exceeded the resultados with topical tacrolimus ointment alone, which only achieved 6.9% mild response and 6.9% good response. Fire needle monoterapia also demonstrated steady repigmentation over time, with 69% of lesions attaining a mild response by month 6. Importantly, no major adverse events occurred. This study provides promising preliminary evidence supporting the use of fire needle terapia, alone or in combination with topical tacrolimus ointment, for inducing repigmentation in non-segmental stable vitiligo. As a non-pharmacological approach, fire needle terapia warrants further study as an alternative vitiligo tratamento.",

    "abstract": "Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common functional bowel disorder that affects a significant portion of the general population, with an estimated prevalence of 5 to 20%. Among individuals with IBS, approximately one-third of patients experience a specific subtype called IBS with constipation (IBS-C). In order to address the gaps in the existing literature and provide baseado em evidence recommendations for clinical practice, we propose a revisão sistemática and network metanálise of pharmacological and non-pharmacological (including traditional, complementary, and integrative medicine (TCIM)) approaches for the management of IBS-C patients. This study aims to synthesize the available evidence, compare the relative efetividade and segurança of various intervençãos, and identify the most promising strategies for IBS-C management. This revisão sistemática and network metanálise (NMA) follow PRISMA-NMA guidelines and are registered in PROSPERO. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving adults diagnosed with IBS-C using standardized criteria are included. Both pharmacological and non-pharmacological intervençãos are compared against placebo, sham, or active tratamentos. Primary resultados and timepoints are defined based on expert input. Searches were performed in PubMed, Cochrane CENTRAL, Embase, and Web of Science. Data extraction and risk of bias assessments were conducted by two independent reviewers. Random-effects models and frequentist NMA were used, with heterogeneity and inconsistency evaluated. 107 RCTs related to IBS-C were identified from databases. These studies evaluated resultados, including global improvement, qualidade de vida (QoL), stool frequency and consistency, pain severity, bloating, urgency, straining, incomplete evacuation, discomfort, depressão, ansiedade, and stress. Other resultados included work productivity, cramping, mucus, tratamento satisfaction, recurrence rate, rescue medication use, and the need to defecate without being able to. Among the primary resultados, 13 studies assessing global IBS-C symptoms using the IBS-SSS scale were included in the NMA. Various tratamentos such as acupuntura, breathing training, Chinese medicine, and linaclotide were compared against no intervenção. The only tratamento that showed significant improvement was breathing training, which reduced the total IBS-SSS score compared to no intervenção (MD = -116.08, 95% CI: -219.10 to -10.59). Other tratamentos, including acupuntura, Chinese medicine, and linaclotide, did not show a significant effect on global IBS-C symptoms. For further resultados, linaclotide showed significant improvement compared to placebo in the response of CSBM (RR = 2.47, 95% CI: 1.76 to 3.48). Additionally, Chinese medicine combined with linaclotide, linaclotide alone, and tenapanor increased the frequency of CSBM per week compared to placebo, whereas tratamentos like minesapride and PEG plus electrolytes did not. Linaclotide had the highest probability of improving CSBM frequency, followed by Chinese medicine plus linaclotide. Regarding mental health resultados, no significant differences were found among the tratamentos for depressão or ansiedade based on the NMA results. This network metanálise provides valuable insights into the management of IBS-C, revealing the potential of non-pharmacological intervençãos such as TCIM approaches. While linaclotide demonstrated efetividade in improving stool frequency, further clinical research is needed to establish the long-term benefits and optimal integration of TCIM practices into IBS-C tratamento.

    "abstract": "The World Health Organization estimates that mental disorders affect around one billion people, with 14% being young adults between the ages of 18 and 25. In this context, auriculoterapiaone of the Integrative and Complementary Health Practicesemerges as a promising intervenção for emotional disorders. However, few studies have investigated participants' perceptions regarding the use of this intervenção in emotional issues. The aim of this study was to analyze the perceptions of undergraduate and graduate students about the use of auriculoterapia in emotional disorders. This is a qualitativo study, approved by an ethics committee (approval number: 5.700.107), conducted between August and September 2024. The participants were 23 undergraduate and 11 graduate students from a public higher education institution who had some degree of emotional disorder, assessed by the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21), and who underwent weekly auriculoterapia sessions. The interviews were analyzed using Bardins content analysis. Three categories of discussion were established. (I) Benefits of auriculoterapia in relieving emotional symptoms: (...) I feel less anxious, youre able to deal with stressful situations better (P1); (...) I had many episodes of ansiedade, really strong crises (...) it's been quite a while since I last had one, and I started to notice a decrease over time (...) (E1). (II) Benefits of auriculoterapia in physical symptoms: (...) Ive noticed that my performance has improved, my nights of sleep have been better (...) (P2); I remember that as soon as I started auriculoterapia, I was able to sleep (...) I feel better physically (...) I feel less tired (...) I wake up more energized (E2). (III) Satisfaction with auriculoterapia: (...) These benefits of feeling more comfortable with yourself, I think theyre priceless (...) (P3); (...) This experience has shown me that it really makes a difference (...) (E3). The participants perceptions in this study were that auriculoterapia provides emotional and physical benefits, in addition to improved acadêmico performance, and consequently, increased satisfaction with the use of this intervenção.

    "abstract": "Sun exposure of the skin leads to body own synthesis of the \"sun-shine vitamin D3\" which plays an important role in bone health but appears to have also protective effects with regard to mortality from various malignant cancers, cardiovascular disease, type II diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis and depressão. Starting with the UV-induced photolysis of 7-dehydrocholesterol to pre-vitamin D3 in the skin, the metabolite 25(OH)D3 is synthesized in the liver, and subsequently converted in the kidneys to the active hormone 1,25(OH)2D. To maintain health effects of the \"sunshine-vitamin D3\" in healthy persons, blood serum levels of 25(OH)D3 > 20 ng ml-1 are recommended. In contrast, significant parts of the Western European population suffer from 25(OH)D3 deficiency, as they have serum levels below 15 ng ml-1. It is also known that the effects of oral vitamin D supplementation (cholecalciferol) are limited due to the short degradation times, while endogenously produced 25(OH)D3 concentrations are slowly degraded over several weeks. To investigate vitamin D3 synthesis by solar-simulated UV radiation under consideration of current radiation protection guidelines, 20 non-adapted healthy volunteers (8 men, 12 women; skin phototypes I-IV; mean age: 38.6 ± 11.5 years, range: 22-59 years) were exposed to 15 whole-body irradiations for three weeks and up to five times per week during winter. Both spectrum and irradiance were chosen to be similarly with solar exposures at noon-time in summer in central Europe under cloudless skies. Daily doses were firstly limited to 30 % of the individual erythema threshold dose determined in non-adapted skin (MEDi), and increased up to 65 % of the MEDi during the series to compensate UV skin adaptation. The corresponding exposure times for each side of the body were between 7 and 15 minutes. 25(OH)D3 concentrations were measured from blood samples at baseline, and after every fifth irradiation. In most subjects, 25(OH)D3 levels increased from baseline deficiency (13.4±7.46 ng ml-1) after completion of the series. The increases varied individually and depended on age. They were greater the lower the baseline concentrations were, but the increases weakened from week to week. After finishing of the series, the 25(OH)D3 concentrations were 32.4±6.9 ng ml-1 (range: 18-42 ng ml-1) in young and middle-aged persons up to 45 years, and 17.9±9.2 ng ml-1 (range: 8-32 ng ml-1) in elderly individuals aged 49-59 years. However, all subjects spontaneously and consistently reported both an increase in well-being and a feeling of activation after each tratamento. The results demonstrate the potential of sun-simulated, low-dose helioterapia to induce a sufficient vitamin D3 status lasting over several weeks and to ensure desired preventive and therapeutic effects. However, this method appears particularly suitable for younger individuals. Other modes of action of sun simulated low-dose helioterapia beyond vitamin D3 may exist that require further investigation, including skin-brain crosstalk through release of hormones that affect the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal axis.",

    "abstract": "Conventional cardiac rehabilitation (CR) programs often experience low participation and high dropout rates, especially among culturally and linguistically diverse communities, such as Chinese migrants. This pilot study assessed the feasibility and preliminary efetividade of a co-designed, community-based CR program tailored to Chinese migrants living in Australia. This pilot randomised controlled trial included Chinese migrants in Australia who had undergone stent placement or coronary bypass graft surgery. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to either a CR group or a waitlist control group. The CR program comprised: (1) a virtual shared medical appointment - a single 90-minute group consultation and 30-min individual sessions with a nurse, a dietitian, and a physiotherapist; (2) virtual Tai Chi - 60-minute sessions, twice weekly for 24 weeks; and (3) health education - four semi-personalised weekly messages for 24 weeks. Primary resultados were feasibility indicators including recruitment rate, retention rate, and segurança. Secondary resultados included cardiometabolic markers, physical capacity (6-minute walk test), self-efficacy, social support, qualidade de vida, psychological wellbeing (DASS-21), physical activity (7-day steps and walking distance) and satisfaction. Assessments were conducted at baseline, week 12 and week 24. Statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS (version 26.0). Nineteen participants (31.6% female) were enrolled in the study. No program-related adverse events were reported, and the retention rate was 86%. Compared with the waitlist control, the CR group showed significant improvements over 24 weeks in physical capacity (6-minute walk test (meters), CR group: 571.58±70.65 and waitlist group: 446.59±131.45, respectively, p=0.041), physical activity (7-day walking distance (kilometers), 51.22±16.77 and 27.76±9.39, respectively, p=0.01), and psychological wellbeing, including depressão (DASS-21 depressão score: 15.84 [95%CI 9.68 to 21.99] and 21.50 [95%CI 15.39 to 27.61], respectively, p=0.017), ansiedade (DASS-21 ansiedade score: 16.57 [95%CI 11.02 to 22.12] and 20.25 [95%CI 14.68 to 25.82], respectively, p=0.006), and overall distress (DASS-21 total score, 51.50 [33.12 to 69.88] and 63.50 [45.21 to 81.79], respectively, p=0.017). No statistically significant differences were observed at 24 weeks in other secondary resultados. A culturally tailored, community-based CR program is feasible, safe, and potentially effective in improving physical fitness, physical activity, and psychological wellbeing among Chinese migrants in Australia. A larger, fully powered randomised trial is warranted to confirm these findings.",

    "abstract": "Coronary heart disease (CHD) remains the leading cause of death worldwide, with hypertension as a major risk factor. Psychological factors such as stress, ansiedade, and depressão are increasingly recognised as modifiable cardiovascular risk factors, yet they are frequently underdiagnosed and undertreated. Tai Chi, a mind-body exercise, may offer potential physical and psychological benefits for this population. This study aimed to evaluate the effects and segurança of a standardised Tai Chi intervenção on psychological distress and cardiovascular function in individuals with CHD and/or hypertension. In this randomised ensaio clínico, 120 adults aged 40 years with CHD and/or hypertension were randomly assigned (1:1 ratio) to either a Tai Chi intervenção or a waitlist control group. The Tai Chi group participated in a standardised 24-week program, consisting of two-hour sessions twice weekly for the first12 weeks, followed by once-weekly sessions for the remaining 12 weeks. The primary resultado was perceived stress, measured by the Perceived Stress Scale-10 (PSS-10). Secondary resultados included ansiedade (Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale), depressão (Beck Depression Inventory-II), cardiovascular function (blood pressure, heart rate, heart rate variability, lipid and glucose profiles, and C-reactive protein), qualidade de vida (SF-36) and physical fitness (6-Minute Walk test). Assessments were conducted at baseline, week 12, and week 24. Using a linear mixed model, the Tai Chi group showed a statistically greater reduction in PSS-10 mean scores (95% CI) at week 12 than the waitlist control (10.38 [8.81 to 11.97] and 12.46 [10.85 to 14.07], respectively; p=0.006), though the differences were not statistically significant at week 24 (10.44 [8.86 to 12.03] and 11.71 [10.08 to 13.34], respectively; p=0.077). Statistically and clinically significant improvement of physical fitness in the Tai Chi group compared with the waitlist group were found at 12 weeks (558.41 [533.48 to 583.34] and 513.59 [488.59 to 538.58]; p<0.001) and 24 weeks (552.81 [528.17 to 577.44] and 519.63 [494.42 to 544.84], respectively; p=0.002). Between-group differences were also observed in depressão, diastolic blood pressure, and qualidade de vida, but not in the remaining secondary resultados. The attendance rate was 82.5%. No severe Tai Chi-related adverse events were reported. Conclusions: A 24-week standardised Tai Chi program appears to be safe and feasible intervenção that may improve perceived stress and selected cardiovascular and psychological resultados in individuals with CHD and/or hypertension.

    "abstract": "Bathing during the immediate postoperative period following heart surgery can lead to significant pain and hemodynamic changes, compromising recovery. Research has shown that music can be an effective non-pharmacological technique to reduce pain and ansiedade, promoting relaxation and speeding up recovery. In Brazil, the use of music is considered and regulated as an Integrative and Complementary Health Practice (PICS). This study aimed to evaluate the effect of music on pain levels and changes in vital signs in patients during bed baths in the immediate postoperative period following heart surgery. A randomized controlled trial (RCT), double-blind, was conducted in a Cardiac Intensive Care Unit of a private hospital in Natal, Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil, following the CONSORT guidelines. The study involved 38 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery in the immediate postoperative period. The patients were divided into two groups: a control group - CG (headphones without music) and an experimental group - EG (headphones with the patient's preferred music). Pain levels were assessed using the Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) and the Wong-Baker FACES Scale (WBS), applied during and after the intervenção. The study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee (CAAE: 11745419.6.0000.5292) and registered in the Brazilian Registry of Clinical Trials (RBR-69w6f5z). The patients were allocated as follows: 21 in the CG and 17 in the SG. There were no differences between the groups with regard to sociodemographic, clinical and surgical data. In the experimental group, the ANOVA test for the study variables, with a significance level of 5%, indicated statistically significant differences regarding Heart Rate (mean before the intervenção of 92.53 [SD: 11.98] and mean after the intervenção of 88.82 [SD: 12.79], p = 0.019). In this same group, there was a statistically significant difference in pain, with a mean on the NRS scale before the intervenção of 3.29 [SD: 3.14] and after the intervenção of 0.88 [SD: 1.41], p = 0.001, and on the WBS scale (mean before the intervenção of 2.82 [SD: 1.88] and after the intervenção of 0.71 [SD: 1.21], p < 0.001). In the control group, no significant differences were observed in vital signs, NRS (p = 0.062), and WBS (p = 0.158). The results corroborate with the literature showing that music terapia is effective in reducing post-operative pain and ansiedade by alleviating pain and lowering heart rate without causing side effects. Nursing plays an essential role in pain management and can incorporate music terapia as a supplementary tool in patient care, particularly during post-operative baths. This study suggests that music can be a valuable strategy to complement drug tratamento. This study found that playing music during bed baths reduced pain levels in the immediate postoperative period of coronary artery bypass graft surgery. Future research should explore the combination of music with other complementary therapies and assess the perceptions of both patients and professionals regarding its efetividade in different contexts and groups.",

    "abstract": "Alcohol Abstinence Syndrome is a common disorder among individuals who excessively consume alcohol. It is characterized by physical and psychological signs and symptoms, such as ansiedade and cravings, the latter being an intense desire to consume alcohol. Integrative and complementary practices, such as the use of Bach Flowers, may alleviate the most intense symptoms of this condition. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of Bach Flowers in Alcohol Abstinence Syndrome ansiedade and cravings levels. Bach Flower Remedies, developed by Edward Bach, are integrative therapies using wildflower extracts to promote emotional balance by acting on subtle energy fields. A randomized double-blind ensaio clínico was conducted at the Psychosocial Care Center for Alcohol and Other Drugs III in Paraíba, Brazil. Thirty-six participants were randomly assigned to experimental (Bach Flower) and control (placebo) groups. The remedy was diluted in water and administered orally: four drops, four times a day, for five days. Amber bottles and blinded administration by a researcher unaware of group assignments ensured blinding. Data collection involved sociodemographic and clinical instruments: the Revised Clinical Assessment of Abstinence, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (IDATE), and the Brazilian version of the Alcohol Craving Questionnaire  Short Form  Revised (ACQ-SR). In the ACQ-SR, factor 1 related to craving from positive and negative alcohol-related reinforcement, and factor 2 to the intention to consume alcohol for pleasure. Assessments occurred before and five days after the flower essence application. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee (CAAE 61762022.1.0000.5537) and registered in the Brazilian Registry of Clinical Trials (RBR-7pzb4sw). Using the Student's t-test, in individuals who received BFRs (EG), the State-IDATE score decreased from a mean of 59.1 to 39.0 (SD: 12.0-10.2), p < 0.001, and the Trait-IDATE score decreased from a mean of 61.39 to 52.94 (SD: 8.71-8.75), p < 0.001. The mean ACQ-SR Factor 1 decreased from 45.17 to 15.56 (SD: 8.73-7.29), p < 0.001, showing a shift from severe to mild craving. Effect sizes were large for State-IDATE (1.61), Trait-IDATE (1.27), ACQ-SR Factor 1 (3.76), and global ACQ-SR (3.70). ACQ-SR Factor 2 showed a medium effect size (0.55), increasing from a mean of 12.83 to 15.67 (SD: 4.03-3.82), p = 0.033, indicating reduced intention to consume alcohol for pleasure. In the CG, no statistical differences were found in State-IDATE (p = 0.441), Trait-IDATE (p = 0.896), ACQ-SR Factor 1 (p = 0.238), or Factor 2 (p = 0.469). Assessment of ansiedade and craving, along with therapies that reduce the desire for alcohol, are essential to minimize relapses and prevent both clinical and emotional deterioration. Integrative and Complementary Practices (ICPs) can significantly contribute to the Psychosocial Care Network (RAPS) by providing therapeutic support for users and tratamento teams. These practices are low-cost and non-invasive, making them an effective strategy to incorporate into intervenção and tratamento of alcohol users. This research suggests that Bach Flowers Remedies can reduce ansiedade, both as a trait and a temporary state, as well as reduce cravings, as assessed through the ACQ-SR index.",

    "abstract": "Chronic pain has an impact on saúde pública due to its high prevalence and impairment of the physical and psychosocial aspects and qualidade de vida of the population. Auriculoterapia and Foot Reflexology are non-pharmacological integrative practices that, through the stimulation of nerve endings in the areas of the ear and feet, respectively, promote health and well-being by reducing pain symptoms. This study analyzed the meanings that emerged from a group of dor crônica sufferers participating in an acadêmico extension project, based on their experience with Auriculoterapia and Foot Reflexology. This is a case study research, with analysis made through a focus group conducted with eight of the thirty participants, after twelve weeks receiving care with protocols of both techniques, performed successively, being the Foot Reflexology session lasting 45 minutes, twice a week, for 6 weeks, and Auriculoterapia once a week, both using a protocol of points related to dor crônica complaints. Data analysis took place from a qualitativo and quantitative perspective, using the Iramuteq software, which classified the words extracted from the focus group based on text segments from the textual corpus, allowing us to understand the users' perspective on the experiences in the two types of integrative practice. Regarding the effects perceived in Reflexology, relaxation and reduced ansiedade stood out, and these perceptions were related to a greater understanding of the body. Improved sleep was the highlight of Auriculoterapia, which was associated with the perception of improved functionality. The good acceptance and recognition by the user of the improvement of dor crônica symptoms through non-invasive practices that are also low cost, indicates that such techniques should be considered in the context of saúde pública services and also in professional health training institutions.",

    "abstract": "Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) tratamento remains challenging. Although controversial, homeopatia is globally used and integrated into Brazil's saúde pública system. A growing body of physicochemical research and a recent revisão sistemática of placebo-controlled meta-analyses indicate specific effects of homeopathic preparations, warranting further investigation. We are conducting ten N-of-1 trials to evaluate the efetividade and segurança of classical homeopatia in MDD. An N-of-1 trial is a randomized, double-blind, controlled, multiple-period crossover study conducted on a single patient. This study presents the initial findings from the first completed participant. We hypothesized that personalized homeopathic tratamento would yield clinically significant differences compared to placebo in MDD patients. Additionally, we conducted a physicochemical analysis of the fifty-millesimal (LM) potencies of the individualized homeopathic medicine Sulphur used for the patient, alongside plasma proteomic analysis. A 28-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover trial assessed Sulphur LM4-7 efetividade and segurança in a 45-year-old female with MDD. The primary resultados were Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) scores, and secondary resultados included SF-12 and Clinical Global Impression Scale scores. We conducted Plasma proteomics and physicochemical analyses (SEM, DLS, ICP-MS) of Sulphur LM2-7 During the open-label run-in phase, the patient demonstrated marked improvements across multiple domains, including a significant reduction in depressive symptoms (BDI-II scores decreased from 32 to 5). In the N-of-1 trial BDI-II scores increased significantly in the placebo group (P=0.017), whereas no significant change was observed in the Sulphur-treated group (P=0.243). Overall symptom improvement with homeopatia compared to placebo, controlling for baseline, was 78% (p<0.05). MCS-12 significantly decreased during placebo (P=0.008) but remained stable during homeopathic tratamento (P=0.542). No significant PCS-12 changes were observed (P>0.2). CGI-I scores improved during the run-in tratamento but showed no further change during the N-of-1 trial. Sulfur-loaded LM formulations presented nanoparticles, as confirmed by SEM analysis, demonstrated distinct particle size characteristics via DLS, and exhibited quantifiable sulfur concentrations detected through ICP-MS. Proteomic analysis suggested that Sulphur tratamento modulates immune response pathways, highlighting a potential mechanism underlying its antidepressant-like effects. This personalized integrative homeopathic protocol demonstrated superior efetividade to placebo in the studied individual. The physicochemical characteristics and proteomic findings indicate potential immunomodulatory effects mediated by nanomedicine mechanisms. However, further research involving larger cohorts is warranted to confirm these preliminary observations.",

This secondary analysis uses data from the International Cohort of Lifestyle and Dietary Health (INCLD-Health) Study. Biological, dietary, lifestyle, mental, and physical health measures were collected from 190 CIH students at the National University of Natural Medicine (NUNM) in Portland, Oregon. Descriptive statistical analyses summarized diet, nutrition, physical activity, and mental health data. Among CIH students, 86% regularly used NHPs, with vitamin D, B vitamins, and omega-3 fatty acids being most common. The cohort primarily consumed whole grains, fruits, vegetables, nuts, and non-fried fish, with a mean daily intake of 1646 calories and above-average fiber consumption at 27.2g. Stress levels among CIH students were generally lower, with 37.1% reporting low stress, 58.3% moderate stress, and 4.6% high perceived stress, as measured by the Perceived Stress Scale. CIH students appear to engage in higher rates of certain health practices, such as regular use of NHPs, healthy dietary habits, and atenção plena-based activities. This may reflect the emphasis on nutrition, NHP education, and preventative lifestyle modifications within CIH programs.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: Telomeres length (TL) has been emerging as a potential biomarker of aging. The phenomenon of age-related telomeres shortening is complex and biological mechanisms underlying this process are not yet definitively established. Shorter than the average TL for a specific age group, has been associated with increased incidence of age-related diseases. Our previous studies showed that Mindfulness practices with Tao Calligraphy can improve Depression, Pain and positively affect well-being. Materials and Method: Pilot study investigated effect of atenção plena with tracing calligraphy daily for 2 hours a day for 9 months in 6 women and 6 men, age >60, who also received a subtle energy transmission at the beginning of the study. The subjects continued other atenção plena practices of their choice. The FISH flow cytometry (FC) TL measurement and Quality of Life Questionnaire SF-36 were completed at the start of the study, at 3 months and at 9 months. Study was IRB approved and registered with ClinicalTrials.Gov. ANOVA of TL by FISH FC in peripheral blood leukocytes at 3 (T1) and 9 (T2) months: Lymphocytes Telomeres length: Baseline:5.357->T1: 5.209->T2: 4.831 p-0.142; Granulocytes Telomeres length: Baseline:6.589->T1: 6.878->T2: 6.297 p-0.168; One-Tailed paired T-Tests of TL by FISH FC in peripheral blood leukocytes at 3 (T1) months: Lymphocytes Telomeres length: Baseline:5.357->T1: 5.209 p-0.686; Granulocytes Telomeres length: Baseline:6.589->T1: 6.878 (4.386%) p-0.012*; ANOVA of SF-36 QLQ score at 9 months: 5 indexes exhibited statistically significant positive improvement; the other 3 indexes also improved, but not significantly. Physical Functioning: change 75.3->80.4 p0.02*; Role Limitations due to Physical Health Problems: change 68.45->73.2 p0.05*; Role Limitations due to Personal or Emotional Problems: change 66.8->71.0 p0.11; Energy / Fatigue: change 60.25->64.75 p0.01*; Emotional Well-being: change 70.1->74.6 p0.02*; Social Functioning: change 82.3->85.5 p0.16; Bodily Pain: change 65.2->69.55 p0.04*; General Health: change 55.45->60.25 p0.08; Conclusions: Results indicate that atenção plena practices using Tao Calligraphy tracing have significantly increased TL in Granulocytes in 3 month; and they significantly improved the qualidade de vida for participants on the SF-36 scale in 5 categories in 9 months. Observed positive trend in TL over 3 month in Granulocytes only, could be attributed to much faster cell cycles in Granulocytes then in Lymphocytes. The other reason for lack of more significant TL increase could be the small size of the cohort, the measurement method (TL rather than the commonly used telomerase activity measurement and the use of Flow Cytometry rather then Molecular tests); age of participants (previously reported TL increase with statistical significance in the subset of younger meditators, but not the older subset); lifestyle of study subjects who were long-term meditators where the effect on TL and QLQ may have already manifested over the year.",

    "abstract": "The experience of pain is a prevalent co-occurring condition, arising as a complex consequence of HIV infection itself and as a side effect of antiretroviral terapia among the 60,000 Canadian individuals living with HIV/AIDS (PLHAs), adversely affecting PLHAs sleep, mood, cognition, emotional health, social and workplace participation, and overall qualidade de vida. The International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP 2020) defines dor crônica as a distressful sensation linked to tissue harm, persisting for over three months. To cope with pain, PLHAs utilize a range of approaches, including standard medical care, alternative healing methods, and body-mind practices. To begin to address this gap, our research project will employ community-based research methods to better inform the pain research and service delivery sectors with the following objectives: 1) create, educate and assist a team of peer researchers for collaborative study involvement, 2) conduct a bilingual survey of HIV-positive PLHAs who self-identify as living with dor crônica in Canada, and 3) Apply Q-sorting to priotize survey data based on critical needs of those with pain and HIV. An exploratory sequential design mixed-methods approach was adopted to achieve goals inherent in community-based research. Aim 1: community engagement, peer training; Aim 2: recruit up to 500 Canadian PLHAs, aged 18 or older, fluent in English or French, and self-identify as living with dor crônica as defined by the IASP (pain for more than 3 months). Outcome measures: Presence of neuropathic pain, Pain severity, Pain-related beliefs and coping, Chronic pain acceptance, Emotional well-being, Social aspects (e.g., disruption associated with HIV, dor crônica, and stigma), Pain tratamentos including medications, physical and psychological modalities, and Complementary and Integrative Health (CIH) modalities, Sociodemographics, Clinical compassion , Sense of coherence; Aim 3 : Q sort with 6 or more unique groups (online, in person). Here we report on findings from Aim 2. A total of 244 individuals completed the survey (63% identifying as male, mean age: 48). Half of respondents report having access to a family doctor, 37 % report having low income (37%), or on disability (19%). More than 50% report a substance use disorder, many had stable CD4+ count (42%), ~25% used cannabis daily, and 59% report not having a partner to provide support. Common themes as to approaches for addressing pain include avoidance and isolation, physical activities, substance use, hobbies and creative outlets, use of pain medication, the effects of emotional and lifecourse struggles, and faith/spiritual practices. Respondents offered important feedback on what they believe healthcare providers should know such as: appreciation for their care and dedication, the need for a wider variety of options for pain management, the importance of addressing accessibility, the need for increased empathy, and that many feel frustrated with issues like judgement and delays as part of their healthcare. PLHAs have a broad range of experiences with dor crônica that suggest a need for further research and implementation efforts in the delivery of healthcare services.",

    "abstract": "Food waste significantly contributes to resource depletion and avoidable greenhouse gas emissions, making its reduction crucial for both planetary and human health. Food and catering services represent an effective lever for reducing food waste, as large quantities of food are prepared, served but also discarded every day. Especially within hospitals, catering and related waste substantially contribute to hospitals overall emissions. The University Hospital Essen has therefore implemented seven measures to reduce its food waste in patient catering. A sustainability assessment was conducted to evaluate the efetividade and resource efficiency of the measures. Over six months, the University Hospital Essen implemented seven food waste reduction measures. These comprised 1) measuring and analyzing food waste; 2) regular strategic meetings; 3) training dietitians; 4) reducing the portion size of spreadable fat; 5) removing yoghurts from admission meals; 6) reducing soup- and sauce production; and 7) increasing freezing of overproduced foods. Food waste was measured before and after the intervenção, over a four-week period each. The implementations efetividade was assessed by comparing food waste savings before and after the intervenção. For resource efficiency, benefit-cost ratios were calculated. Additionally, a qualitativo assessment examined the implementation effort, longevity and transferability of each measure. After six months, food waste was reduced by 19 % (26,500 kg), equivalent to 35 g less food waste per meal for about 1,400 patients receiving three meals daily. The intervenção was therefore effective in reducing food waste. The reduction translated into savings of 90,159 euros, 43,557 kg CO2e and approx. 24 million kcal saved. The benefit-cost analysis showed that each euro invested resulted in savings of 1.62 kg of food waste, 1,482 kcal, 2.67 kg CO equivalents, and 6.53 euros. Most food waste came from plate waste, mainly due to poor discharge management and ward-kitchen communication, leading to meals being prepared for patients who were no longer present. Reducing the amount of spreadable fat, however, was especially effective in reducing food waste, requiring minimal effort. Due to additional workload in daily work activities, measuring food waste needed high effort. All other measures required low implementation effort and were highly transferable, long-lasting and sustainable. The intervenção demonstrated that targeted measures are effective in reducing food waste in hospital catering, with both environmental and economic benefits. An enhanced discharge management and communication system are recommended to further reduce food waste and improve efficiency in patient catering.",

    "abstract": "Arthritis includes over 100 diseases impacting connective tissue and other body systems. These conditions are chronic and management is lifelong. Older age is a risk factor, but arthritis can occur at any age, impacting whole-person wellbeing and qualidade de vida. Yoga is a mind-body practice that includes movement, breathwork, atenção plena, relaxation, applied philosophy and lifestyle. Yoga's whole-person approach has the potential to improve arthritis management in conjunction with established pharmacological and surgical intervençãos. While the use of yoga has been studied for segurança, feasibility and efetividade in multiple arthritic conditions, no review has gathered that evidence across diagnoses and the lifespan. This review includes a summary of evidence for yoga's role in arthritis management from children to elderly adults. The PubMed Central database through the United States National Library of Medicine was searched for relevant indexed literature using the terms \"yoga\" AND (arthritis OR rheum*) with the \"ensaio clínicos\" filter applied. Title and abstract screening was conducted according to inclusion criteria of 1) ensaio clínicos, 2) yoga intervençãos, 3) participants with arthritis or other rheumatic disease, excluding 1) published protocols and 2) secondary findings only. Additional searches were conducted with the terms \"juvenile\" and \"elderly\" added and \"ensaio clínico\" removed to ensure the capture of studies at both ends of the lifespan. Studies were assessed for markers of rigor, including sample size, study design, comparison group and reporting quality. Thirty-nine manuscripts were identified as relevant with 11 eliminated as a study protocol or secondary analysis. The remaining 28 manuscripts were published by research teams in Australia, Canada, Croatia, India, New Zealand, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and the United States. Thirty-nine percent included patients with osteoarthritis OA; 36% were in rheumatoid arthritis, with the remaining few focused on ankylosing spondylitis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, or multiple arthritis diagnoses. Regarding age and gender, 75% of studies included adults in general with two of those recruiting women only. Two studies targeted older adults, two were for young adults (one of only young women), two were with adolescents, and one included both adults and children. Twenty of the 28 studies were randomized controlled trials (RCTs), with five identified as pilot RCTs. Five studies were non-randomized single group pilot studies and the remaining two included case-control and case study. Common comparators were exercise and usual care. Almost half used an 8-week intervenção with durations ranging 1-3 months and frequency of practice between daily and weekly with thrice per week as most common. Styles of yoga were diverse, including hatha yoga, chair yoga, teleyoga, Iyengar-based, Integral-based, biomechanically-based, relaxation-based, Raj Yoga, and more. Common resultados included pain, physical function, disability and qualidade de vida with some reporting only feasibility resultados. Most reported significant improvements in yoga users and about half found significant differences between groups with no serious related adverse events. Yoga appears safe for arthritis patients and may improve clinical resultados across the lifespan. Future research should examine dose response and aim to align practice recommendations with specific clinical populations.",

    "abstract": "This study examines Australian stakeholder views on integrating the traditional and complementary medicine (T&CM) workforce into the national healthcare system. The research is contextualised by factors including: increasing use of T&CM; persistent health workforce shortages; and Australian Government strategies aimed at strengthening healthcare. These strategies, while not explicitly acknowledging the T&CM workforce, align with T&CM principles including universal health coverage, improving wellbeing, disease prevenção and multidisciplinary, person-centred care. This mixed-methods, multi-phased cross-sectional study is guided by a política de saúde and systems research approach. Reported are two components: a nationwide survey of adults in Australia and semi-structured interviews with general practitioners (GPs) and practice nurses. The online questionnaire collected demographic data, personal T&CM use, and opinions about T&CM practitioners role in Australian healthcare. It included multiple-choice and free-text responses, with specific sections for medical/allied practitioners, T&CM practitioners, other health-related workforce (acadêmico, administrative, policy), and healthcare consumers. GPs and practice nurses who completed the survey were invited for interviews to explore their T&CM knowledge, experiences, and perceived barriers/facilitators to care collaboration with T&CM providers. The survey was distributed through Australian Primary Health Networks, professional associations, consumer groups and social media platforms. Between July-August 2024, 697 valid surveys were received. Respondents were predominantly female, aged 45-64 years (54%), had used T&CM (91%), represented all Australian states and territories, and 66% were born in Australia. The sample comprised 37% who identified as consumers (n=256), 28% as T&CM practitioners (n=195), 25% medical or allied healthcare providers (n=177), 8% healthcare admin/policy/acadêmico (n=53), and 2% unclassified. Interviews were undertaken with 10 GPs and 3 practice nurses. Key findings include:  Overwhelming support for formal integration of T&CM practitioners including 94% of consumer and 82% of medical/allied practitioner respondents.  Around 80% of respondents believed qualified T&CM practitioners could potentially contribute to meeting the goals of the Australian Governments Primary Health Care 10 Year Plan and National Preventive Health Strategy.  75% of medical/allied respondents supported access to systems of T&CM that are based on beliefs or knowledge that does not align with biomedical science.  61% of surveyed medical/allied providers referred to T&CM practitioners, although some avoided written referrals due to medicolegal concerns.  82% of T&CM providers referred patients to GPs. While two-thirds of medical/allied survey respondents considered themselves sufficiently informed to advise patients about T&CM, interviewed GPs expressed hesitancy in referring patients to T&CM providers, citing insufficient knowledge about their education and scope of practice. The study's limitations include low survey uptake among individuals who have not used T&CM or do not support its integration. A cross section of Australian stakeholders believe that greater utilisation of qualified T&CM practitioners could enhance the healthcare systems focus on disease prevenção and promoção da saúde, and help to meet the goals of government strategies to improve health resultados through strengthening locally delivered, person-centred, wellness-focused multidisciplinary care. Persistent barriers to collaborative care between T&CM and mainstream providers need to be addressed to facilitate effective integration. The perspectives of participants for and against integration are examined.",

    "abstract": "Globally, one in three university students experience mental health conditions such as depressão, ansiedade, and sleep disturbancesleading to poorer acadêmico performance, increased loneliness, and reduced qualidade de vida. Health-promoting behaviours - including physical activity, sleep, social connection - are associated with improved mental wellbeing, yet there is limited insight into how students perceive and use these strategies for self-management. In 2024, Australian university students were recruited via digital and community channels to complete an online survey exploring wellbeing management. Eligible participants were aged 18 years, enrolled in a university program, and had no history of five specified psychiatric disorders. Quantitative data were analysed descriptively. A subset (n=375, 45%) responded to an open-ended question exploring lifestyle-based mental health strategies. Responses were analysed using inductive thematic analysis. The characteristics of free-text responders were largely similar to non-responders in ethnicity, gender, residential status, mental health conditions, and lifestyle categories. Statistically significant differences showed responders were more likely to be aged 26 years, live alone, be enrolled in a PhD, report chronic conditions, and practice meditação and wellness activities, while being less likely to study full-time or report average/higher socioeconomic statussuggesting that those with lived experience and greater health awareness were more inclined to share personal insights. Thematic analysis identified three key themes: (1) awareness of lifestyles role in mental health, (2) barriers to implementation (e.g., financial constraints, time pressure, low self-esteem), and (3) enablers of engagement (e.g., personalisation, flexibility, routine). Students most frequently identified physical activity, social connection, and time in nature as effective self-management tools. While knowledge was high, sustained behaviour change was hindered by structural and personal barriers. University students value lifestyle-based approaches for mental health but face common implementation challenges. Public health efforts should prioritise accessible, student-centred intervençãos that integrate behavioural flexibility and social support to promote sustainable mental wellbeing strategies in tertiary settings.",

    "abstract": "Masterythe sense of control over ones lifeplays a key role in managing chronic disease. In people with multiple sclerosis (pwMS), higher mastery has been linked to improved psychological wellbeing, illness acceptance, tratamento adherence, and qualidade de vida. Given MSs progressive nature, understanding how mastery evolves over time and identifying modifiable predictors may guide intervençãos to support self-management and long-term health resultados. A longitudinal survey of 602 pwMS was conducted over five years. Mastery was assessed using the Pearlin Mastery Scale. Group-based trajectory modelling identified distinct mastery trajectories over time. Predictors included demographic (e.g., socioeconomic status), clinical (e.g., depressão, fatigue), and lifestyle variables (diet, physical activity, vitamin D, meditação, non-smoking). Multinomial logistic regression was used to evaluate predictors of trajectory group membership, with the mid mastery group used as the reference. Four distinct mastery trajectories were identified: low (10%), mid (43%), high (34%), and highest (13%), with these proportions representing the assignment to each group. Comparing the high vs. mid mastery groups, higher than average socioeconomic status (RR=2.24, 95% CI: 1.323.80), high quality diet (RR=1.40, 95% CI: 1.091.80), and regular physical activity (RR=1.28, 95% CI: 1.001.65) were positively associated with high mastery. In contrast, depressão (RR=0.43, 95% CI: 0.250.74) and fatigue (RR=0.64, 95% CI: 0.480.86) were negatively associated. These findings highlight the role of modifiable lifestyle and clinical factors in supporting higher mastery trajectories over time in pwMS. Public health and clinical intervençãos that target depressão and fatigue, alongside promoting healthy diets and physical activity, may improve self-mastery in pwMS. Enhancing mastery may support better disease self-management, reduce symptom burden, and improve qualidade de vida in this population.",

    "abstract": "Temporomandibular disorders (TMD) affect 5-12% of the population and are challenging to manage effectively. Temporomandibular Joint Balancing Therapy (TBT), a manual terapia in Korean traditional medicine, has emerged as a complementary approach for TMD tratamento. TBT aims to correct jaw imbalances, relieve pain, and improve function through specific manipulation techniques. Despite growing clinical use, systematic data on how TBT is implemented in practice, its perceived efetividade, and barriers to implementation remain limited. This study surveyed TBT-trained practitioners to evaluate its clinical application patterns and practitioners' perceptions, aiming to guide future standardization and baseado em evidence integration. We conducted a cross-sectional survey among 90 Korean practitioners (76% male, 24% female; 93% Korean medicine doctors) who completed a TBT training program. The questionnaire covered demographic information, training experience, TBT utilization (frequency of use, conditions treated), perceived efetividade (confidence level, tratamento duration, satisfação do paciente), barriers to use, and suggestions for improvement. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and chi-square tests to examine associations between practitioner characteristics and various aspects of TBT practice. Descriptive analyses revealed that most respondents were Korean medicine doctors (93%) with varied age distribution (46% aged 60+, 41% in 40s-50s). Most completed TBT training before 2020 (59%) and received integrated theory-practical education (99%). Chi-square analyses showed significant associations between gender and preferred education methods (p=0.005), with males favoring hands-on components (58% vs. 33%) and females preferring theoretical content (43% vs. 24%). TBT usage varied considerably: 33% (95% CI[23.3%, 42.7%]) reported frequent use (10 cases weekly), 19% rarely used it, and 48% applied it occasionally. Primary applications included TMD (67%), non-TMJ musculoskeletal conditions (64%), and spinal/postural issues (59%). While 26% reported high satisfação do paciente and 58% moderate satisfaction, practitioners identified notable barriers: patient cost burden (55%), skill deficiency (42%), difficulty obtaining patient consent (36%), and time constraints (30%). Most practitioners (80%) indicated that significant symptom improvement typically required 1-3 months of terapia. The findings highlight several needs: standardized baseado em evidence protocols for different conditions, enhanced practical training addressing gender-specific preferences, regular case-sharing platforms, and research addressing cost-efetividade concerns. These measures would improve practitioner confidence, optimize tratamento efficacy, and facilitate TBT integration into mainstream TMD management. This survey provides important insights into the current status of TBT implementation among trained Korean practitioners. The findings underscore several needs for advancing TBT practice: 1) developing standardized, baseado em evidence protocols for different TMD subtypes and related conditions; 2) enhancing practitioner education through expanded practical training and case-based learning, particularly addressing gender differences in training preferences; 3) establishing regular case-sharing platforms among practitioners; and 4) conducting clinical research addressing cost-efetividade and tratamento duration concerns. These measures would improve practitioner confidence, optimize tratamento efficacy, and facilitate TBT integration into mainstream TMD management as a standardized complementary terapia.",

    "abstract": "Ethnic minorities medicine represents a comprehensive integration of medical theory, technical skills, and material resources developed by a nation through its unique survival environment and disease management experiences. It embodies long-standing heritage, distinct ethnic characteristics, and regional features. As a vital component of traditional Chinese medicine, ethnic minorities medicine exhibits unique clinical advantages and significant service potential. However, its diverse theoretical systems and complex intervenção schemes complicate objective clinical efficacy evaluation. Moreover, the unique cultural attributes of each ethnic minorities medicine hinder cross-cultural promotion. Evidence-based medicine (EBM) prioritizes the use of the best available evidence to guide clinical practice. EBM capability encompasses the ability to collect, evaluate, integrate evidence, make clinical decisions and conduct research based on EBM principles. Enhancing EBM capability is crucial for improving the scientific evaluation of ethnic minorities medicine's efficacy and promoting its modernization and internationalization. To address the current status of clinical research in ethnic minorities medicine, this study surveyed specialized medical units and research institutions to comprehensively assess the current EBM capability and specific development needs, providing a basis for formulating high-quality development strategies. A questionnaire survey was administered across multiple ethnic minorities medical institutions and research organizations, focusing on three core dimensions: (1) perceptions and attitudes towards baseado em evidence medicine (EBM); (2) advantages and challenges in the development of ethnic minorities medicine; and (3) demands and recommendations for enhancing EBM capability within ethnic minorities medicine. This study collected a total of 501 valid questionnaires, of which 103 were obtained through resending to regions with insufficient initial participation. The survey respondents included 354 practitioners of ethnic minorities medicine (70.66%), representing Tibetan, Mongolian, Uyghur, Zhuang, and Korean medicine. Among the respondents, 146 (29.14%) reported familiarity with baseado em evidence medicine (EBM), while 355 (70.86%) had only a general understanding or had never heard of EBM. A significant majority (93.61%) believed that introducing EBM could promote the development of ethnic minorities medicine. The primary challenges identified were the lack of EBM professionals and limited understanding of its application in clinical practice (88.22%). In a 9-point importance rating for enhancing baseado em evidence abilities, high scores were noted for standardizing clinical practice guidelines (7.50 ± 1.90) and determining sample sizes in clinical research (7.45 ± 1.90). For improving clinical research literacy, respondents emphasized the need for expert acadêmico lectures and experience sharing (80.64%) and baseado em evidence methodology monographs on ethnic minorities medicine (80.04%). Practitioners of ethnic minorities medicine demonstrate a positive attitude toward the integration of baseado em evidence medicine (EBM). However, significant gaps remain in EBM education and dissemination. Enhancing baseado em evidence capabilities can be achieved through targeted measures, including cultivating or recruiting EBM professionals, establishing baseado em evidence support platforms for clinical research, organizing regular acadêmico lectures and exchanges, and strengthening the development of theoretical frameworks and evaluation systems tailored to ethnic minorities medicine. These efforts will facilitate the adoption of baseado em evidence practices that align with the unique characteristics of ethnic minorities medicine.",

    "abstract": "Vitiligo is a challenging dermatological condition, characterized by its difficulty in tratamento and high recurrence rate, which significantly impacts patients' qualidade de vida. Uyghur medicine has developed unique therapies and effective medications through extensive clinical experience, offering potential solutions for vitiligo tratamento. We have carried out the following two tasks in the preliminary work: (1) In response to the complex composition of Uyghur medical intervenção for vitiligo and the subjective criteria for judging tratamento timing, a method combining quantitative data analysis with qualitativo expert consensus was adopted to develop standardized and operable diagnostic and therapeutic protocols as well as quantitative evaluation criteria. (2) Relying on the Uyghur medical consortium, a cluster-randomized controlled trial was conducted to assess the efetividade and segurança of the optimized vitiligo tratamento protocol. However, primary hospitals practicing Uyghur medicine are scattered across different regions, with significant disparities in local economic and medical levels, leading to considerable differences in their access to resources. How to promote the widespread adoption and application of optimized tratamento protocols, and facilitate the implementation of the developed protocols and technologies in medical consortium hospitals to improve the quality of primary healthcare services remains a challenge. We aim to investigate the facilitators and barriers to the implementation of the optimized Uyghur medicine tratamento protocol for vitiligo at the local level, and to understand the main difficulties in adhering to the protocol from the perspective of various stakeholders. A semi-structured interview approach was employed, involving doctors, patients, hospital administrators, caregivers, and other relevant stakeholders. The interviews focused on several key aspects: the implementation status of the tratamento protocol, the impact of health insurance policies (such as hospital stay duration control), satisfação do paciente, subjective perceptions of tratamento efetividade, and the main difficulties identified by stakeholders in adhering to the protocol. Interviews were conducted with stakeholders from 10 Uyghur medicine hospitals of different levels in Xinjiang, including 2 hospital administrators, 19 doctors, 14 patients, 3 caregivers, and 3 methodology experts. The preliminary analysis revealed the following results:1.Main Barriers: 1The optimized protocol requires a 3-month tratamento course (with two follow-up tratamentos per week after discharge), which leads to poor adherence among patients living far from the hospital. 2Some hospitals lack an in-house pharmacy, making it difficult to prepare oral medications, resulting in patients having to purchase them at a higher price. 3A portion of patients are not proactive in their tratamento, showing little concern for their condition and unwillingness to follow up. 2.Main Facilitators: 1High satisfação do paciente. 2Standardized tratamento reduces the impact of varying physician skill levels on patient resultados. Ensuring that research resultados truly benefit the rural and pastoral populations requires further investigation. It is essential to consider the local realities and adopt targeted dissemination measures (implementation strategies). In subsequent research, we will take into account the impact of influencing factors, including the influence of ethnic minorities cultural factors. We will employ a co-design approach locally and incorporate implementation science methods to identify implementation strategies and further verify the implementation resultados.",

    "abstract": "This review systematically assessed the evidence on the efetividade and segurança of pryma, traditional yogic breathing techniques, for patients diagnosed with mental disorders. We registered the protocol prior to conduction of the review (CRD42024550239). We searched PubMed, PsycInfo, and Central until April 2024. We calculated standardized mean differences (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) from both intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol (PP) data for symptom severity (primary resultado), health-related qualidade de vida and depressão (secondary resultados) using Hedges correction for small samples. For risk of bias (RoB) assessment, we used the Cochrane RoB 2 tool. We included seven publications on six randomized controlled trials that examined 517 patients with PTSD, depressão, and mixed non-psychotic mental disorders and compared pryma to passive controls (wait list and attention control) or standard care (psychoterapia, electroconvulsive terapia, antidepressants). Overall RoB was some concerns in two and high in four studies. Meta-analysis of both the ITT (SMD = -0.27, 95% CI = [-0.52, -0.03], I² = 10%) and PP samples (SMD = -0.35, 95% CI = [-0.57, -0.12], I² = 0%) showed that pryma significantly reduced post-intervenção symptom severity in comparison to passive controls. When compared to standard care, both ITT and PP meta-analyses showed comparable results in reducing symptom severity. For secondary resultados, only PP analyses on qualidade de vida showed significantly higher post-intervenção effects for pryma in comparison to passive controls (SMD = 0.59, 95% CI = [0.31, 0.87], I² = 20). Sensitivity analyses excluding all studies with high risk of overall bias revealed significant effects of pryma on symptom severity and qualidade de vida, however only in PP samples and in comparison to passive controls. Adverse events were reported inadequately. This metanálise suggests short-term effects of pryma when integrated in out- and inpatient care of mental disorders. In consideration of the overall high risk of bias and low number of analyzed patients, pryma should not be used instead of standard therapies. Further research is needed to explore long-term effects and adequately assess adverse events.",

    "abstract": "Patients with post-COVID-19 syndrome frequently face challenges in obtaining effective tratamento for symptoms following the acute SARS-CoV-2 infection due to the multi-factorial and often unclear pathophysiology. Against this background, integrating salutogenic strategies  which emphasize health literacy and self-regulation  alongside symptomatic tratamento may provide additional therapeutic value. We therefore developed and tested a mind-body medicine group program for its efetividade and segurança. We conducted a randomized controlled trial (NCT05798221) including 86 patients (77.9% female; mean age 50.8 ± 13.0 years) who reported post-COVID-19 symptoms for an average of 20.0 ± 9.8 months, following 1.5 ± 0.7 SARS-CoV-2 infections. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either a 10-week interdisciplinary group intervenção (NASH) plus tratamento as usual (TAU), or TAU alone. The NASH program was based on the principles of mind-body medicine, Traditional European Medicine, and ear acupuntura. It included weekly six-hour sessions combining interdisciplinary group consultations, health education, and guided exercises in physical activity, relaxation, breathing techniques, nutrition, and complementary self-care. The primary resultado was post-COVID-19 symptom severity, assessed by the Somatic Symptom Scale (SSS) at 16 weeks. Further secondary resultados were assessed at both week 10 and week 16. Statistical analyses were conducted on an intention-to-treat (ITT) basis using analyses of covariance, adjusting for baseline values and participants tratamento expectations. Results are presented as mean differences with 95% confidence intervals (CI). ITT analyses revealed significant between-group differences on post-COVID-19 symptom severity at week 10 (-3.61 SSS, 95%CI=-5.47|-1.75, p < .001) as well as at week 16 (-3.00 SSS, 95%CI=-4.64|-1.35, p < .001). Further analyses will reveal possible effects on secondary resultados. Adverse events were mild and transient, including occasional dizziness, skin irritation, circulatory discomfort, and headaches related to specific NASH techniques (e.g. breathing exercises, mustard flour, acupuntura, and cupping). Participation in the NASH intervenção was not associated with serious adverse events. NASH significantly reduced post-COVID-19 symptom severity compared to TAU, with effects sustained over 16 weeks. The intervenção was well tolerated, with only minor adverse events reported. The findings underscore the potential of integrating salutogenic strategies into the tratamento of individuals with post-COVID-19 syndrome.",

    "abstract": "In the field of phytoterapia, quality cannot be reduced solely to the presence of healthy/active components and the absence of harmful ones. Copper Chloride Crystallisation (CCC) is an interesting methodology, belonging to metabolomic fingerprinting based on pattern formation, able to study samples comprehensively. It can potentially characterise qualitativo differences due to specific pharmaceutical processes as well as their physical/chemical properties. Viscum album L. extracts obtained by mixing fermented juices of summer and winter harvests were used as samples. CCC sensitivity to qualitativo differences was tested with three levels of increasing difficulty. The three levels aimed to differentiate extracts 1) of two mistletoe subspecies, 2) of mistletoe belonging to the same subspecies but grown on two different host trees, and 3) mixed by hand or with a specific machine. A computer analysis was performed on the outputs. 7 parameters related to the structure and the texture of the CCC patterns were selected. All 7 parameters showed significant differences (ANOVA p < 0.006) at the first sensitivity level. 4 parameters (3 of which related to texture) showed significant differences (ANOVA p < 0.003) at the second sensitivity level. 2 parameters (both related to structure) showed significant differences (ANOVA p < 0.006) at the last sensitivity level (effect size range 1.75  0.22, 0.56  0.26, 0.27  0.20, respectively). CCC proved able to detect differences in a phytotherapeutic product, spanning from easily detectable chemical differences to qualitativo ones. Further research is needed to fully explore the potential of the methodology in this area.",

    "abstract": "Homeopathy is a therapeutic method that originated in Germany during the eighteenth century and has since spread progressively across the globe. Through a wide variety of homeopathic medicinal products, homeopatia addresses potentially all medical conditions. Its therapeutic effects have faced controversy since its early development, despite a substantial empirical body of research. Since several decades, scientists active in homeopathic fields have been gathering an expanding body of literature. Maintaining an updated bibliography that organises clinical evidence by medical condition is essential for future studies. Seven online databases (Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, SCOPUS, Science Citation Index, CINAHL, and LILACS) were searched for homeopatia and related terms for the years 2021 to 2025. We included studies that compared a homeopathic product or intervenção with a control regarding the therapeutic or preventive resultado of a disease (classified according to the International Classification of Diseases-11). All languages were included. The data were extracted independently by two reviewers and analysed descriptively. Seventy investigations met the inclusion criteria. Additionally, two studies published before 2021, which had been overlooked in the previous HOMIS, were found, bringing the total to 72. Fifty-two studies had a therapeutic purpose, nineteen had a preventive purpose, and one had both. 87 percent were randomized controlled trials (n=63), whereas the rest were non-randomized studies (n=9). The leading comparator was placebo (n=46). The type of homeopathic intervenção was classified as complex (n=7), individualized(n=33), routine (n=16) and other (n=16). The potencies ranged from D1 to LM12. The included studies explored the effect of homeopatia mainly on COVID-19 infection (n=13) and a total of 23 medical conditions. We present the evidence in an online database. This revised bibliography outlines the state of clinical research on homeopatia in terms of intervenção studies between 2021 et May 2025. The information it provides will support future reviews, potentially examining the most researched conditions, their clinical effects, and the potential biases in the studies included.",

    "abstract": "The mode of action of homeopathic remedies is still an open question. Valuable tools for investigating this topic are bioassays using plants sensitive to homeopathic remedies. The aim of our study was to investigate the effect of the homeopathic remedy Carbo vegetabilis 30x on garden cress seedlings (Lepidium sativum L.) grown in calcium nitrate solution. Cress seedlings were cultivated upright on chromatography paper in hanging plastic bags containing calcium nitrate solution (0.5 g/l), which led to an increase in shoot length and a decrease in root length compared to cress grown in pure water. The tratamento of the seedlings consisted of dissolved Carbo vegetabilis 30x globules or dissolved unimpregnated sugar globules as control, or the cress was left untreated. The bags containing the seedlings were scanned after a 5-day growth period at 14.5°C, and the length of the seedlings was analysed with the software ImageJ and a digital tablet. The resultado parameters were shoot length, root length, total length, and root/shoot ratio. To evaluate the stability of the experimental system, Systematic Negative Control (SNC) experiments were conducted. A total of 12 independent experiments were performed involving around 25000 seedlings. All experiments were randomised and blinded during tratamento, measurement, and basic data analysis. When Carbo vegetabilis 30x was applied, a slight yet significant increase in shoot length of 0.05 cm (p=0.002) was observed compared to the control. There were no significant effects on the parameters root length and total length. The root/shoot ratio of the seedlings decreased significantly (p=0.003) through application of Carbo vegetabilis 30x. The SNC experiments showed no significant differences in cress growth, suggesting a stable experimental setup. These results indicate a small but significant effect of Carbo vegetabilis 30x on the growth of cress cultivated in calcium nitrate solution. Due to the large number of samples in this test series and the correspondingly high statistical power, a random result is not to be assumed. In addition, the SNC experiments verified the stability of the experimental setup. The obtained data are in favour of a possible effect of Carbo vegetabilis 30x on cress seedlings. Future studies can use this bioassay to investigate the mode of action of homeopathic remedies.",

    "abstract": "Shogaols are biologically active constituents of ginger which have a chemical structure similar to gingerols. The most common constituent is 6-Shogaol which has been shown to be a promising anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory agent that also possesses strong hepatoprotective effects. In a small investigative study among six early-stage, transfusion-independent patients with MDS, Golombick et al. (2017) found that 6-Shogaol caused a decrease in the serum ferritin (SF) levels of three patients who had elevated SF at baseline. Upregulation of hepcidin levels was observed in two of these three patients, possibly through an improvement in liver function with 6-Shogaol supplementation. Hence, 6-Shogaol, a natural food derivative, may lower the iron overload by decreasing iron absorption A pilot ensaio clínico was conducted in two Sydney Haematological centres. Thirty adult patients with diagnosed Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) were enrolled and received 1 tablet (equal to 20mg of ginger standardised to 20% 6-shogaol) for 24 weeks. Patients were followed up two monthly. Bloods were taken every two months for full blood count, liver enzymes, electrolytes, kidney function, full iron studies including ferritin, BUN and thyroid status. Another blood pathology tube was taken to measure Hepcidin. Quality of life questionnaires were also conducted. Thirty patients were enrolled, with 4 patients withdrawing. One due to seeing no change, one passed away for other reasons, one patient has an allergic reaction to the ginger supplement, and another was excluded due to disease progression. Of the 26 participants that completed the 6 months of supplementation, n=16 showed some benefit in haematological parameters. Thirteen of the 16 participants that showed some benefit haematologically, also showed improvements in cytopenia. Three of the participants had reduced ferritin levels and half (n=8) of the 16 participants showed 10% disease improvement with the other half (n=6) showing 10% improvement in cytopenia. Three of the participants had more than 30% improvement in disease status. The results of this trial indicate that a ginger extract (6-Shogaol) at a dose of 20mg daily may assist in reducing disease progression and improve haematological parameters. Considering this cohort is elderly with comorbidities, this trial indicates that 6-shogaol can be taken safely in this cohort without extra burden on the participants A dose of 20mg of 6_Shogaol supplementation daily in MDS patients may reduce disease progression, improve haematological parameters, improve cytopenia and improve qualidade de vida.",

    "abstract": "Chemoterapia is a common tratamento for breast cancer and has significant short-term side effects. Chinese medicinal herbs (CMHs) are often used alongside chemoterapia to help manage these effects. This revisão sistemática aimed to assess the effects of CMHs in alleviating chemoterapia-induced short-term side effects in women with early breast cancer. We searched eight databases and two registry platform, up to May 2024. We screened the reference lists of relevant trials and reviews. Two authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias. We assessed the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach. We included 25 RCTs with 2,319 participants and 17 different CMHs, each study ranging from 30 to 352 participants. Only one study has a low risk of bias, other studies have at least one domain at unclear or high risk of bias. Main results for clinically key resultados: Incidence of nausea or vomiting: CMHs may reduce this resultado when compared with no tratamento (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.86; very low certainty, 4 or 6 cycles). CMHs plus ST (versus ST; RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.15 to 1.38; very low certainty) may have no effect on this resultado. Incidence of fatigue/relief of fatigue: black soybean extract EW02 plus ST (versus placebo+ST; RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.64; very low certainty, 2-3 cycles) and Buzhong Yiqi pills (versus no intervenção; RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.09; very low certainty, 2 cycles) may have no effect on relieving the fatigue. Karnofsky performance status improvement (10 points increase): CMHs (versus no intervenção; RR 2.15, 95% CI 1.24 to 3.72; very low certainty, 2 to 8 cycles) may improve the QoL. However, CMHs plus ST (versus ST; RR 1.35, 95% CI 0.73 to 2.47; very low certainty, 2 and 6 cycles) may have no effect on the QoL assess by Karnofsky Performance Status improvement. Abnormal rate of liver function: CMHs (versus no intervenção; RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.99; very low certainty) may reduce the abnormal liver function during 12 days to 6 cycles of chemoterapia. However, CMHs plus ST (versus ST; RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.22 to 1.18; very low certainty) may have no effect on the abnormal liver function during 4 and 6 cycles of chemoterapia. Abnormal rate of renal function: CMHs (versus no intervenção; RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.31 to 2.30; very low certainty) may have no effect on the abnormal renal function during 3 to 6 cycles of chemoterapia. Low to very low certainty evidence suggested that CMHs may had potential effects to reduce the incidence of nausea and vomiting. Moderate to very low certainty evidence showed a beneficial effect on the qualidade de vida from CMHs. We identified no high certainty evidence for the efetividade and segurança of any terapia included. Only minor AEs were reported in the studies and there was insufficient evidence of adverse events/reactions related to CMHs. Large, well-designed ensaio clínicos targeting the most promising CMHs are needed before any conclusions can be drawn.",

    "abstract": "Diminished ovarian reserve (DOR) is a leading cause of infertility, against the backdrop of delayed marriage and childbearing trends, exacerbates the decline in population fertility rates. A growing number of clinical studies have demonstrated that chinese herbal compound can effectively and safely restore hormone levels and improve ovarian reserve function. However, the efetividade of Bushen Chengyun Recipe (BCR),the experienced formula of famous veteran TCM doctors in patients with ovarian hypofunction has not been thoroughly evaluated. Is conducting a randomized control trial (RCT) to assess the efetividade of BCR in improving pregnancy rates among women with DOR feasible A multi-center, two-arm, parallel group, double-blinded feasibility RCT was conducted. Women with DOR, trying to conceive naturally or by in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer (IVF-ET), were randomly assigned to BCR group or placebo group. Both groups were treated for 3 consecutive menstrual cycles. Primary resultados were ongoing pregnancy rates, live birth rates, antral follicle count (AFC), endometrial thickness, perfusion index of ovarian artery (PI), and female hormones [estradiol (E2), progesterone (P), luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH)]. Secondary resultados included Score of Traditional Chinese Medicine Syndrome Scale (TCMSS), segurança and health-related resultados (mental health, qualidade de vida, diet, exercise, sleep and weight). Statistical significance of the differences between the two groups (P-values) were exploratory. Sixty women completed the randomized controlled trial (RCT) by March 2023. Participants included 36 women from the Wenling Clinical Center (Wenling City, Zhejiang Province, China) and 24 women from the Beijing Clinical Center (Fangshan District, Beijing, China). All 60 participants (100% adherence) completed the intervenção protocol and endpoint assessments. After tratamento, in the BCR group, the AFC, endometrial thickness and PI, while the serum E2, P, AMH levels were increased compared with those in the placebo group(P<0.05, P<0.01) . The serum LH and FSH in the BCR group were lover than the placebo group(P<0.05), as well as the score of TCMSS. The clinical pregnancy rate in the BCR group was significantly higher than in the placebo group (63.33% [19/30] vs 20.00% [6/30], P < 0.001). The therapeutic strategy of tonifying the kidney and promoting pregnancy significantly enhances clinical pregnancy rates in patients with DOR-related infertility, improves ovarian reserve function, and promotes endometrial receptivity. Furthermore, the BCR demonstrates a favorable segurança profile and provides robust clinical evidence for advancing the modern mechanistic interpretation of the ancient TCM principle of \"prescription-syndrome correspondence\" .",

    "abstract": "The positive effects of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) on oocyte and embryo quality improvement are often concerned. While the results on DHEA-induced endometrial improvement are controversial. To evaluate whether DHEA intervenção improved endometrial function and reproductive resultados during in vitro fertilization/intracytoplasmic sperm injection (IVF/ICSI) cycles and to thus provide clinical recommendations. PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE and Web of Science from database inception to 31 July 2024, without language restrictions. The references of conference proceedings and websites on ensaio clínicos were manually checked. Parallel-controlled randomized controlled trials (RCTs) design; women underwent IVF/ICSI, patients in the experimental group received adminstration with DHEA, whereas the control group received with or without placebo; and the resultados included reproductive or endometrial function. RCTs evaluating the effects of DHEA on IVF/ICSI resultados were included. Risk of bias and quality of evidence (QoE) were assessed according to the Cochrane Collaborations tool and the Grading of Recomendações Assessment, Development and Evaluation system. Odds ratios (ORs) and mean differences (MDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were assessed by random-effects or fixed-effects models. Subgroup and meta-regression analyses were used to find sources of heterogeneity. Trial sequential analysis was used to judge the stability of the resultados. Trial sequential analysis was used in order to control for random errors. A total of 16 trials included 1973 women. DHEA tratamento significantly increased endometrial thickness (MD=0.93, CI: 0.27 to 1.60; low QoE), which helped improve clinical pregnancy rate (CPR) (OR=1.34, 95% CI: 1.08 to 1.67; low QoE). DHEA administration also increased the quality of oocyte and embryo [including the number of oocytes retrieved (MD=0.73, CI: 0.36 to 1.10; low QoE), oocytes fertilized (MD=0.48, CI: 0.10 to 0.87; low QoE), transferred embryos (MD=0.27, CI: 0.09 to 0.46; very low QoE), and high-quality embryos (MD=0.65, CI: 0.27 to 1.03; low QoE)]. Subgroup and meta-regression analyses revealed that heterogeneity might be related to disease type, ovarian stimulation protocol, and addition time of DHEA tratamento. There was insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion regarding the live birth rate/ongoing pregnancy rate, miscarriage rate, and M oocyte number of DHEA. And no severe efeitos adversos were observed with DHEA administration. Due to the apparent improvemen in the CPR, women with thin endometrium might benefit from DHEA cotreament. Due to the limited sample size and methodological problems, the QoE was low to very low; hence, the results should be interpreted with caution. The efetividade of DHEA requires more research before it can be considered for clinical practice.",

The project Integrative Therapy of Chronic Diseases in the Bamberg Day Clinic (InteChron-TK) evaluated a 1012-week 60 hours (6 hours terapia at one day per week) multimodal integrative non-pharmacologic medical day clinic tratamento covered by the health insurance at three clinics for Integrative Medicine (Bamberg, Berlin, Essen) in Germany. The program mind-body medicine in integrative and complementary medicine  MICOM- day clinic - included stress management and relaxation techniques, exercise, herbal terapia and naturopathic self-help strategies as well as nutrition counselling and teaching kitchen. Primary resultado assessed health-related qualidade de vida (HrQoL), secondary resultados included self-reported work ability (010 scale), psychological symptoms (HADS), perceived stress (PSS-10) and fatigue (MFI-20). Assessments were conducted at baseline, tratamento completion, and at 6-month follow-up. Of n=678 recruited patients, n=608 (female 89%; mean age of 53.4±10.7 years) attended 5 tratamento sessions and were included in the analysis (Bamberg n=296; Berlin n=106; Essen n= 206). Indications were rheumatic and pain diseases (n=231), oncological diseases (n=172), gastrointestinal diseases (n=94), post COVID fatigue (n=83) and others (n=28). Clinically relevant and statistically significant improvements in all resultados were observed at the end of tratamento and were largely sustained at 6-month follow-up. Improvements in HrQoL were seen in general and across all subgroups at both time points, with stronger effects among oncological and gastrointestinal patients. General health status (EQ VAS) improved from a median of 60 to 70 (p<0.001). Work ability improved by 10% (median 5 to 6; p<0.001). Anxiety symptoms (HADS) decreased from a median of 8 to 6, and depressive symptoms from 7 to 5 (both p<0.001). Perceived stress (PSS-10) was reduced from a median of 21 to 16 at tratamento end and to 17 at follow-up (both p<0.001). Fatigue (MFI-20) declined significantly (median 65 to 57, p<0.001). Post-COVID patients initially improved, but effects declined at follow-up. The findings suggest a potentially sustainable benefit of a multimodal integrative non-pharmacologic day clinic tratamento (MICOM  day care) on key symptoms in chronically ill individuals. Future randomized controlled trials are needed to further establish efficacy.",

Confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE) can detect barrier dysfunctions in vivo. Multimodal integrative mind-body medicine-based (MBM) terapia, including stress management, exercise, relaxation, herbal terapia and nutrition, may enhance symptoms, gut barrier function and patient well-being. IBS patients admitted for a two-week inpatient stay underwent gastroduodenoscopy with CLE and local food challenge (standardized protocol for egg white, soy, milk, yeast or wheat) to test for a primary (1°CLE+) or secondary food induced (2°CLE+) duodenal barrier dysfunction  after exclusion of IgE-mediated food allergy. All IBS patients received a multimodal MBM terapia. Patients with barrier dysfunction were additionally recommended to adhere to an adjuvant preclinically tested barrier-stabilising terapia with myrrh, chamomile and coffee charcoal (3x4 dragées/ day), and exclusion of CLE-identified barrier-disrupting foods until a voluntary follow-up CLE. Pre (=1 CLE) and Post (=2 CLE) intervenção, IBS-symptom severity (IBS-SSS), IBS-qualidade de vida (IBS-QoL) and psychological well-being via clinically validated questionnaires were assessed. Of the n=119 IBS patients included in the study, 62% (n=74) showed duodenal barrier dysfunction [1°CLE+: n=27 (23%); 2°CLE+: n=47 (39%) (n=2 for egg white, n=3 for soy, n=9 for milk, n=18 for yeast, n=15 for wheat]. Of those, N=35 IBS patients (47%) with barrier dysfunction at 1 CLE returned for a voluntary 2 CLE after 6.3 ± 3.0 months [at 1 CLE: 1°CLE+: n=15 (43%), 2°CLE+: n=20 (57%); n=25 (71%) female; age 42.9 ± 15.4 yrs, disease duration 11.1 ± 11.2 yrs]. Of returned IBS patients, n=25 (71%) showed an improved gut barrier integrity, of whom 16 (46%) achieved complete stabilisation of the gut barrier (CLE-). Pre-intervenção, IBS patients were clinically characterized by severe IBS symptom severity (IBS-SSS 304.8 ± 83.4), severely impaired IBS-related qualidade de vida (IBS-QoL 42.7 ± 16.6) and concomitant severe level of ansiedade and depressão (HADS 19.2 ± 7.7), fatigue (MFI-20 66.8 ± 13.1) and perceived stress (PSS-10 31.3 ± 7.7). Post intervenção, patients exhibited significant and clinically relevant improvement in all of these clinical resultados (IBS-SSS p =<.001, IBS-QoL p =<.001, HADS p =<.001, MFI-20 p =<.001, PSS-10 p =0.004). IBS patients have a high prevalence of existing and food-induced duodenal barrier dysfunction (62%).

    "abstract": "Chinese herbal formula granules (CHFGs) have gained global attention as a modernized form of traditional medicine. However, their clinical adoption remains inconsistent. This study aimed to investigate physicians perceptions, prescription habits, and perceived barriers to CHFG utilization in China. We conducted a cross-sectional, structured questionnaire survey of hospital physicians in China from February 25 to March 25, 2025. Respondents were recruited from 60 medical institutions spanning 23 provincial-level regions (Grade 3A hospitals: 60.71%, i.e., the highest tier in Chinas three-level system). The sample included clinicians from both TCM-related departments and non-TCM departments; 24.29% reported working in TCM-related departments, with the remainder distributed across internal-medicine subspecialties. The instrument covered six domains: demographics, prescription frequency, quality perception, medication-guidance practices, healthcare-policy impact, and comparative efficacy versus traditional decoctions. Analyses were quantitative (descriptive statistics and chi-square tests of association); no qualitativo interviews were included in this analysis. Reporting followed STROBE recommendations for cross-sectional studies. Among 140 physicians, 74.29% prescribed CHFGs in <20% of their prescriptions, typically for respiratory and gastrointestinal disorders (75.86%). Despite 85.72% rating CHFG quality favorablyattributing this mainly to raw-material standards (87.72%) and manufacturing processes (82.46%)68.57% reported limited awareness of storage-stability issues. Policy factors were salient: 80.7% viewed insurance coverage as pivotal, and 48.25% explicitly considered reimbursement when prescribing, whereas only 14.29% reported hospital assortments fully meeting clinical needs. Training gaps were evident: 60.7% rated institutional education on CHFG (e.g., dose-conversion sheets) as absent/insufficient, and many noted a lack of standardized medication-guidance materials. Collectively, these data indicate policy constraints, education deficits, and affordability concerns continue to suppress adoption despite perceived convenience and acceptable segurança relative to decoctions. Scaling CHFG use will require coordinated intervençãos: broaden insurance coverage, standardize dose-conversion protocols and medication-guidance materials, and strengthen physician training. Future work should prioritize real-world comparative-efetividade and cost-efetividade evaluations to narrow the gap between perceived value and routine clinical use. Guidance from STROBE can further enhance transparency and comparability of CHFG implementation research.",

Fire acupuntura, a traditional Chinese medicine terapia, has the potential for nerve-immune regulation and multi-target intervenção. This study aimed to explore the effects and potential mechanisms of fire acupuntura on dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis in rats, focusing on the regulation of cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway (CAIP), autophagy and antioxidant. UC rat models were induced by DSS and randomly divided into several groups: Control, DSS model, Fire acupuntura (FA), 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA), sham acupuntura (Sham-FA), Sham-FA + chloroquine (Sham-FA+CQ) and FA + chloroquine (FA+CQ). Phenotypic assessments included disease activity index (DAI), colon length, spleen index, histopathological damage, and immunohistochemical detection of tight junction proteins (ZO-1, occludin). The CAIP was assessed via serum norepinephrine (NE), pancreatic polypeptide (PP), inflammatory factors (IL-1, TNF-, IL-6), and colon acetylcholine (ACh) levels using ELISA, and colon IL-1, TNF-, IL-6 transcription levels using RT-qPCR. Western blot was used to analyze 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (7nAChR) expression. Autophagic flux was evaluated through colon LC3B-II, P62, and AMPK/ULK1/mTOR pathway proteins via Western blot. Oxidative stress was evaluated through colon glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) using ELISA. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were detected by immunofluorescence. For pathway validation, transcription levels of P62, Keap1, and NRF2 were assessed by RT-qPCR. Western blot analysis measured P62/Keap1/NRF2/HO1 pathway proteins. Co-localization of P62, Keap1, and NRF2 was analyzed by multiplex immunofluorescence. The role of P62-Keap1 autophagic degradation in the pathway was further validated using CQ. Fire acupuntura significantly reduced DAI scores (P<0.01), restored colon length (P<0.001), and alleviated spleen index (P<0.001). FA enhanced mucosal barrier function by upregulating tight junction proteins ZO-1 and Occludin (P<0.001, P<0.01), reducing inflammatory infiltration, promoting crypt regeneration, and lowering histopathological index (P<0.001). FA suppressed sympathetic nervous system activity by lowering NE (P<0.001), activated the vagus nerve by increasing PP (P<0.001) and ACh (P<0.01), upregulated 7nAChR (P<0.01), and reduced pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1, P<0.05; TNF-, P<0.01; IL-6, P<0.001). FA activated AMPK Thr172 phosphorylation (p-AMPK/AMPK, P<0.001; p-AMPK/-actin, P<0.001), enhanced autophagic flux by upregulating ULK1 (P<0.01) and Beclin1 (P<0.001) while inhibiting mTOR (P<0.001), and reduced LC3B-II (P<0.001) and P62 (P<0.05). CQ inhibition of autophagic flux caused accumulation of LC3B-II and P62 (P<0.05 and P<0.01, respectively). FA also decreased reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels (P<0.001) and increased antioxidant enzymes (GSH-PX, P<0.001; SOD, P<0.01). FA upregulated the mRNA levels of P62 (P<0.05), Keap1 (P<0.001), and NRF2 (P<0.001), increased P62 Ser 349 phosphorylation (p-P62/P62, P<0.001; p-P62/gapdh, P<0.05), promoted competitive binding of P62 to Keap1 (P62-Keap1 %area, P<0.001), and targeted Keap1 for autophagic degradation (lowered Keap1 protein, P<0.001), thereby enhancing NRF2 nuclear translocation (P<0.001) and upregulating downstream markers HO1 and NQO1 (both P<0.001). Pathway inhibition experiments showed that CQ blocked P62-Keap1 autophagic degradation and NRF2 nuclear translocation, significantly attenuating FAs therapeutic effects. Fire acupuntura significantly improved DSS-induced colitis via CAIP and activated the AMPK/P62/NRF2 axis.",

    "abstract": "Chinese herbal formula granules (CHFGs) are increasingly adopted in clinical settings, yet patient perceptions and experiences remain poorly understood. This study aimed to evaluate patients awareness, satisfaction, and barriers to CHFG utilization in China. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 156 patients across 60 medical institutions. The questionnaire encompassed six domains: demographic characteristics, disease spectrum, medication habits, cognitive pathways, efficacy/segurança perceptions, and healthcare policy influence. Descriptive statistics and chi-square tests were employed to analyze associations between variables. Key findings revealed that a predominantly young adult female population (83.97% female; 76.28% aged 1845 years) was observed, with high awareness of CHFGs (94.87% of respondents had prior knowledge, primarily through physician recommendations (85.14%)). While over 80% favored CHFGs for their convenience, such as eliminating decoction requirements, 60% reported dissolution-related challenges during use. Safety perceptions exhibited contradictions, with 54.3% expressing concerns about heavy metal residues and 39.6% fearing allergic reactions, despite 61.07% stating no apprehensions about efeitos adversos. Policy influence appeared significant yet underrecognized, as 78.57% acknowledged insurance reimbursement as a critical usage determinant, but 52.7% remained unaware of specific policy details. Efficacy comparisons further highlighted divided opinions, with 40.71% perceiving CHFGs as equally effective as traditional decoctions and 29.29% consistently favoring conventional preparations, underscoring persistent debates over therapeutic equivalence. While CHFGs were lauded for convenience (90.38%) and alignment with modern lifestyles, challenges persisted: dissolution issues (61.5%), taste dissatisfaction (56.25%), and incomplete policy awareness. Patients prioritized taste improvement (56.25% cited this as a reason for non-recommendation) and transparent quality control. Notably, 43.51% expressed concerns over additive excess and pesticide residues, reflecting skepticism toward industrial processing. This study highlights a paradox: while CHFGs offer practical advantages, their clinical uptake is constrained by technical limitations and policy gaps. Recomendações include optimizing dissolution technology, expanding insurance coverage, and enhancing patient education on production standards. Future efforts should focus on bridging the gap between perceived convenience and systemic barriers to realize the full potential of CHFGs in integrated healthcare systems.",

    "abstract": "The human microbiome plays a vital role in human health, mediated by the gutbrain axis, with a large diversity of functions and physiological benefits. The dynamics and mechanisms of meditaçãos on oral and gut microbiome modulations are not well understood. This study investigates the short-term modulations of the gut and oral microbiome during an Arhatic Yoga meditação retreat as well as on the role of microbiome in improving well-being through a possible gut-brain axis. A single-arm pilot ensaio clínico was conducted in a controlled environment during a 9-day intensive retreat of Arhatic Yoga meditação practices with vegetarian diet. Oral and fecal samples of 24 practitioners were collected at the start (Day0: T1), middle (Day3: T2), and end (Day9:T3) of the retreat. Targeted 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing was performed for both oral and gut samples. Functional pathway predictions were identified using phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states (PICRUSt2). DESeq2 was used to identify the differential abundant taxa. Various statistical analyses were performed to assess the significant changes in the data. Our findings revealed that Arhatic Yoga meditação together with a vegetarian diet led to changes in the oral and gut microbiome profiles within the 9-day retreat. Oral microbiome profile showed a significant (p<0.05) difference in the species richness and evenness at the end of study, while non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) confirmed the shift in the gut microbiome profile of the practitioners by T2 timepoint, which was further supported by PERMANOVA analysis (p<0.05). Health-benefiting microbes known to improve the gastrointestinal and gut-barrier functions, immune modulation, and gut-brain axis were enriched. gut microbiome of both beginner and advanced Arhatic Yoga practitioners showed similar trends of convergence by the end of study. This implies a strong selection pressure by Arhatic Yoga meditação together with a vegetarian diet on the beneficial gut microbiome. This pilot study demonstrates that Arhatic Yoga meditação practices combined with a vegetarian diet during a short intensive retreat resulted in enrichment of known health-promoting microbes. Such microbial consortia may be developed for potential health benefits and used as probiotics to improve the gastrointestinal and immune systems, as well as functions mediated by the gut-brain axis",

    "abstract": "To develop an intelligent diagnostic model based on tongue images to assist in diagnosing colorectal cancer (CRC), with the aim of providing a convenient and economical non-invasive diagnostic approach for CRC. The tongue image dataset was collected between June 2023 and July 2024. After evaluation and selection by experts, a total of 1,389 tongue images from CRC patients and 1,543 tongue images from non-colorectal cancer (NCRC) participants were included in this study. The original tongue images underwent preprocessing, feature extraction, and pattern recognition. Based on traditional machine learning methods, we proposed a multi-feature fusion clas- sification method to construct a tongue diagnosis model for CRC using tongue features as inputs. To further evaluate the role of tongue images in CRC diagno- sis, we validated the proposed method in an independent external cohort, which included 119 CRC patients and 221 NCRC participants from two different hos- pitals. The tongue-based CRC diagnostic model achieved an accuracy of 87.28% and an F1 score of 0.902, outperforming models that relied solely on single handcrafted features or deep learning-based features. Furthermore, the use of filter-based feature selection methods to eliminate redundant features im- proved the classification performance of the model for CRC. The intelligent tongue diagnosis model developed in this study demonstrates a high discriminative ability for CRC, offering a novel and valuable approach for CRC diagnosis and screening.",

This is achieved by harnessing clinical case data, employing knowledge distillation methodologies, and integrating Direct Policy Optimization (DPO) reinforcement learning techniques. Real-world TCM clinical cases, primarily collected from hospitals and clinical institutions in Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, were employed as the core dataset, reflecting the local cultural and medical characteristics of the Jiangnan region. All data collection and usage strictly adhered to ethical approval protocols, ensuring patient privacy and compliance with institutional review boards. GPT-4o was employed as the reference model to perform knowledge distillation on these clinical case data, thereby generating a high-quality instruction dataset for syndrome differentiation and tratamento. The distilled data was subsequently fine-tuned by the Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) method grounded in the Qwen2.5-7B model to improve its abilities of diagnosis and tratamento, together with competencies of personalized syndrome differentiation and tratamento. Furthermore, an additional dataset of clinical cases was leveraged to emulate the diagnosis and tratamento preferences of TCM experts, with the DPO reinforcement learning technique being applied for ongoing refinement and enhancement. The proposed knowledge distillation approach achieved substantial gains over all baseline models in prescription recommendation tasks, with at least 38.1921 improvement in P@5, 32.6341 in P@10, and 25.0623 in P@20, respectively, and achieved higher BLEU-4 and ROUGE-1 scores compared to direct training, with improved model readability and generalization ability. Despite a marginal reduction in P@5 and P@10 for prescription recommendation tasks, it showed a slight improvement of 0.2857 in P@20, with overall performance comparable to direct training. The model was optimized for improved stability of recommendation via the DPO method, ensuring that when the number of predicted medications exceeded 6, the precision consistently outperformed the knowledge-distilled model. This underscores the efficacy of reinforcement learning in facilitating the model's acquisition of data-driven preferences. The TCM Large Language Model constructed with knowledge distillation and reinforcement learning strategies effectively enhances diagnosis and tratamento reasoning and personalized syndrome differentiation and tratamento competencies. By incorporating real-world clinical cases rooted in Nanjings cultural and medical heritage, with strict ethical oversight and validation, this approach provides new research directions and technical support for intelligent TCM clinical decision-making.",

    "abstract": "Systematic reviews and metaanalyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have generated robust evidence about the health benefits of nature-based therapies. While these approaches are essential, they do not fully capture the contextual and interpretive dimensions of health intervençãos in real-life settings. Especially in the field of Traditional, Complementary and Integrative Medicine (TCIM), patient perspectives, meaning-making processes, and complex interaction patterns play a crucial role, but are rarely systematically considered in research and practice. To address this gap, we present a protocol for a metasynthesis of qualitativo studies on nature-based and forest-based therapies. This approach aims to complement quantitative findings with in-depth insights into participants lived experiences and the multifaceted subjective effects of these intervençãos. The metasynthesis is guided by the following research questions: (1) How do nature-based therapies affect the health and well-being of participants (2) How do participants in nature-based therapies experience and interact with nature and what is relevant to them The metasynthesis follows a systematic approach orientated on the methodological framework developed by Sandelowski and colleagues, incorporating six key phases: (1) conceptualizing the qualitativo research design, (2) conducting a comprehensive systematic literature search and study selection, (3) classifying the findings, (4) synthesizing and integrating qualitativo findings, (5) ensuring methodological rigor, and (6) reporting the resultados transparently. The protocol is structured according to PRISMA-P guidelines and has been registered in the PROSPERO database. The metasynthesis is expected to provide a nuanced, combined inductive and deductive synthesis of participants' perspectives on nature-based intervençãos. Insights that classify and synthesize findings will inform how nature-based therapeutic intervençãos are experienced, what aspects are perceived as beneficial, and what contextual factors shape their efetividade. Metasyntheses represent a valuable method for systematically capturing the richness and complexity of qualitativo primary research. By integrating experiential knowledge, patterns of meaning, and user perspectives, they can enrich and contextualize existing quantitative evidence. In the field of TCIM  particularly with complex intervençãos such as nature-based therapies  this complementary perspective is essential. Understanding participants perspectives on nature-based therapies allows for a more comprehensive picture of previously unrecognized potentials and challenges, which can and should be addressed in the development of future nature-based programs to enhance health and well-being of humans. Using qualitativo metasyntheses highlights the experiential evidence necessary to advance a more comprehensive and person-centered evidence base in conjunction with quantitative reviews and metaanalyses.",

    "abstract": "Homeopathy, as a therapeutic practice, does indeed face significant challenges, both in terms of acceptance and in-depth scientific research worldwide. In the state of Pernambuco, Brazil, few health professionals have sought to specialize in homeopatia. Those who have chosen this specialization have been motivated by their personal experiences to explore this field, seeking solutions that can alleviate conditions without the efeitos adversos associated with many conventional medications. The objective of this study was to quantify the professionals who worked with homeopatia in Pernambuco, identify the medical schools (MS) where they trained, their concerns and difficulties in homeopathic clinical practice, and the pharmaceutical forms prescribed by them. The study was a mixed method and data collection was done through the application of a questionnaire with qualitativo and quantitative responses. Forty health professionals were interviewed, including 36 physicians, 2 dentists, and 3 veterinarians. They identified themselves as unicists (18), pluralists (17), complexists (02), and others (03), with approaches that varied according to the patient's context. The globule and liquid pharmaceutical forms were the main forms indicated by the professionals. The main difficulties reported were the short opening hours of homeopathic pharmacies, little knowledge of the population about homeopatia, low demand as a first-choice tratamento, prejudice by other health professionals, attacks by laypeople and dissemination of distorted information, and resistance from the acadêmico community to homeopatia. Another acadêmico challenge encountered was the fact that none of the interviewees had access to the homeopatia discipline during their undergraduate studies in Pernambuco, evidencing the hegemony of the biomedical model and the invisibility of homeopatia in universities. Misinformation from fellow professionals contributes to distorted perceptions and affects patient culture, relegating homeopatia to a therapeutic resource of last resort rather than a primary option.O método Hahnemanniano é usado por 90% dos prescritores e 10% utilizam o Método Hahnemanniano e o Fluxo contínuo. Em relação às Escalas, 50% dos prescritores fazem o uso da escala centesimal (CH) e decimal (DH); 30% usam exclusivamente a escala centesimal (CH) e 12,5% as escalas centesimal (CH), decimal (DH) e a cinquenta milesimal (LM) e 7,5% usam as escalas centesimal (CH) e decimal (DH). Os prescritores que usam a escala decimal a fazem porque também tem formação profissional pela Antroposofia. The work highlights the need for actions to increase awareness of its foundations and benefits. This is a study with the potential to generate a positive impact on the acceptance and practice of homeopatia in Brazil, and is a tool capable of guiding actions that promote knowledge about homeopatia and its benefits. In Brazil, although homeopatia was first recognized as a medical specialty 44 years ago, none of the higher education institutions among those interviewed who graduated in Pernambuco offered the subject in their curriculum. The prescribers who had access to homeopatia during their undergraduate studies did so at universities outside the state and the country. Homeopathy remains an invisible science within universities today, given the hegemonic practice of the biomedical model.",

    "abstract": "Hemorrhoids remain a prevalent global health concern. Ligation-based therapies, particularly those integrating Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), have emerged as minimally invasive alternatives for managing internal/mixed hemorrhoids. This review aimed to map current evidence and evaluate the efetividade of ligation techniques combined with TCM. A literature review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving ligation-related innovative surgeries for internal/mixed hemorrhoids was done. Literature searching was conducted in PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Sinomed, Wanfang, VIP and CNKI (up to October, 2024). Risk of bias was assessed and evidence quality was evaluated using GRADE. After screening 3090 records, 109 RCTs (sample size range: 30 to 756) were included. Three key comparisons were identified: 1) traditional ligation (12 RCTs) vs routine care (including Chinese medicine line in 6 RCTs); 2) conventional hemorrhoidectomy; 3) innovative techniques (involving scleroterapia, high suspension and low incision(HSL), and herbal fumigation). TCM fumigation was primarily used in the postoperative period, with only 3 trials adopting it as the main intervenção. Primary resultados included efficacy (hemorrhoid resolution), postoperative symptoms (pain, edema), and complications (ankyloproctia). Effectiveness and segurança Efficacy: Traditional ligation showed no significant difference (very low quality, 3 RCTs). Innovative surgery, especially HSL, significantly improved efficacy (moderate quality, 5 RCTs). Surgery combined with TCM herbal fumigation demonstrated improved efficacy (moderate quality, 2 RCTs). Pain: Postoperative pain resultados were heterogeneous in traditional ligation trials. For haemorrhoidectomy, there was a significant increase in pain (very low quality, 2 RCTs). Edema: Herbal fumigation-washing significantly reduced postoperative edema incidence (moderate quality, 1 RCT). Ankyloproctia: TCM-injection-based scleroterapia (e.g., Fanhuang, Xiaozhiling) reduced ankyloproctia risk (moderate quality, 6 RCTs). Ligation-based techniques, particularly those integrating TCM therapies (e.g., herbal fumigation with Sophora flavescens Aiton and Herba Houttuyniae, HSL, and Xiaozhiling scleroterapia), offer promise for mild-to-moderate hemorrhoids. However, the low quality of evidence highlights the need for standardized RCTs with long-term resultado data. Future research should prioritize high-quality ensaio clínicos focusing on optimal integrated TCM protocols, with systematic evaluation of long-term efficacy and efeitos adversos to address existing evidence gaps.",

    "abstract": "Since 2010, Osteopathy is classified by the World Health Organization (WHO) as Complementary Medicine. In 2017, it was included in Brazil's National Policy of Integrative and Complementary Practices in the Unified Health System  SUS. The philosopher and sociologist Madel Luz suggested classifying Traditional Chinese Medicine, Ayurveda and Homeopathy as Complex Medical Systems under the term Medical Rationalities, an initiative to harmonize non-biomedical practices with the biomedical approach, a combative approach centered on scientific truth, a modern scientific rationality. A change of terms from Medical Rationality to Therapeutic Rationality can be justified in the transformation of medicine, which is no longer limited to a confrontational approach to disease, but embraces a broader perspective, adopting more personalized therapeutic approaches, aligned with the individual characteristics of each person. Work developed as a narrative literature review, using the Standards for Reporting Qualitative Research: A Synthesis of Recomendações and PRISMA-P 2020 Checklist, which has been adapted. The study established associations between the concepts of Medical Rationality and the principles underlying Complex Medical Systems. The notion of therapeutic rationality is used here to highlight the specific logic that guides osteopathic care, focusing on its principles, practices, and clinical reasoning. While medical rationalities include broader frameworks, this concept emphasizes osteopathys coherence as a distinct form of care not reducible to biomedical norms. The aim is not to create a new category, but to recognize osteopathys conceptual autonomy within integrative health practices. It demonstrated that Osteopathy can be coherently framed within the scope of Medical Rationality. Furthermore, it offered a critical reflection on the definitions of osteopathy and the current status of its professional regulation. Terms, concepts and characteristics developed in this work bring osteopathy much closer to Medical Rationality and will justify the use of the term Therapeutic Rationality, recognizing the individual and unique perspective of each person.",

    "abstract": "Cannabis sativa is a medicinal plant that has been used for millennia and is currently being investigated for therapeutic applications in several clinical conditions. Its main active compounds, the phytocannabinoids, interact with the human endocannabinoid system, which is involved in sleep regulation. One-third of the worlds adult population reports symptoms of insomnia, making it a common issue in healthcare systems. This potential effect of cannabis on sleep suggests its possible use in the tratamento of insomnia disorder. An integrative review was conducted using the MEDLINE and PubMed databases, covering the period from January 2014 to January 2024, with the descriptors cannabis OR cannabinoids AND insomnia OR sleep. Human studies with full texts available in English or Portuguese that addressed the use of medicinal cannabis for the tratamento of insomnia were included. The initial search yielded 383 articles, of which 26 met all inclusion criteria. The studies originated from seven countries, including two multicenter studies, and were all published in international journals in English. For detailed analysis, the studies were grouped according to methodological design. The main methodologies identified were cohort and cross-sectional studies, totaling 14 articles. Only three revisão sistemáticas were included. Of these, one was a Canadian protocol still lacking final results at the time this review was conducted The other two revisão sistemáticas combined evaluated more than 150 studies and highlighted that most resultados related to cannabinoids are supported by weak evidence, mainly from observational studies or low-impact ensaio clínicos. Three randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included. Two double-blind, placebo-controlled RCTs used standardized cannabis products and demonstrated improvements in sleep quality and duration. The third trial investigated self-reported cannabis use during a cognitive behavioral terapia protocol and found no significant impact on tratamento resultados. Observational and cross-sectional studies, which constituted the majority of the sample, mostly relied on self-reported data and involved large sample sizes. They reported improvements in qualidade de vida, sleep quality, pain management and ansiedade, as well as reduced opioid use and utilization of healthcare service. The most common forms of cannabis use reported were vaporized dry flowers, oils, tinctures, and edibles. The reviewed literature suggests that the endocannabinoid system plays a relevant role in sleep regulation and that medicinal cannabis may be a promising therapeutic option. However, there is still a lack of high-quality placebo-controlled trials in humans. Although widely used, cannabis-based terapia still lacks robust evidence regarding its efetividade in treating insomnia disorder. Findings indicate that phytocannabinoids may alter sleep architecture and improve sleep quality, but the predominance of observational studies highlights the need for rigorously designed ensaio clínicos to better understand its therapeutic role, potential efeitos adversos, and objective sleep resultados.",

    "abstract": "Primary dysmenorrhea (PD) is characterized by cramping pain in the lower abdomen during menstruation. Acupoint stimulation terapia is frequently used to treat PD. We conducted a network metanálise to compare the efficacy and segurança of acupoint stimulation therapies based on the Korean and Chinese clinical practice guidelines for PD. We searched relevant studies from inception to November 1, 2024, in 10 databases including the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Embase, PubMed, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang Database, China Science and Technology Journal Database, SinoMed, KoreaMed, Korean Studies Information Service System, and Oriental Medicine Advanced Searching Integrated System. We used the Cochrane Handbook to assess the risk of bias, RevMan to perform pairwise metanálise, and the Netmeta package of R (4.4.2) software. A total of 120 studies were identified which included 9571 participants with PD. In these studies, 29 types of acupoint stimulation therapies based on Korean and Chinese clinical practice guidelines were reported. The quality of the risk of bias of the included studies was low. Based on a network metanálise, the top three tratamentos were acupoint catgut embedding (ACE) + moxibustion, warm acupuntura + acupressure, and warm acupuntura + western medicine. A visual analog scale (VAS) scores at 3 months follow-up were the highest for ACE + moxibustion, ACE + cupping, and acupressure + manual acupuntura (MA). After adjusting for prostaglandin E2 levels, the scores were highest for ACE, manual acupuntura + western medicine, and manual acupuntura + moxibustion. The result of SUCRA on prostaglandin F2 level, the top 3 were ACE + WM, MA + moxibustion, and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation. Acupoint stimulation therapies are more advantageous than western medicine for adjusting the visual analog score at the time of tratamento, at 3 months follow-up, and for adjusting prostaglandin E2 and F2. Our findings showed that ACE + moxibustion might be best tratamento solution for PD for reducing the visual analog scale scores, and ACE and ACE + western medicine might be best for reducing prostaglandins E2 or F2 levels.",

The prescribable app M-sense Migräne includes features such as relaxation exercises, behavioral recommendations, and headache documentation to support individuals with migraine. This study aimed to evaluate the efetividade of M-sense Migräne in reducing migraine days. We conducted a fully remote, two-arm, parallel-group randomized controlled trial (DRKS00024174) among adults (18 years) in Germany diagnosed with episodic or chronic migraine. Participants were randomized 1:1 via an in-app randomization list to either the intervenção group, receiving the full version of M-sense Migräne (including digital headache diary, relaxation techniques, behavioral modules, and educational content), or to a control group using a diary-only version. The primary resultado was the number of migraine days per 28-day period after 12 weeks (weeks 912), analyzed via ANCOVA adjusted for baseline migraine frequency and migraine type. Secondary resultados included headache days, qualidade de vida (HIT-6), self-efficacy (HMSE-G-SF), migraine-specific health literacy, lost productive time (HALT-30), and days with acute medication use. Between March and September 2021, 477 individuals were randomized (n=238 intervenção, n=239 control). 476 were included in the intention-to-treat analysis (mean [SD] age, 35.2 [10.4] years; 429 [90.3%] female; mean [SD] migraine history 17.4 [10.5] years)). After 12 weeks, no significant difference in migraine days per month was observed (intervenção: 5.79 days [95% CI 5.02;6.57] vs. control: 5.41 days [4.63;6.19]; between-group difference: 0.38 days [0.32;1.08]; p=0.289). Secondary resultados showed no statistically significant group differences. No serious adverse reactions were reported. For a particularly severely affected patient group, the integrative digital application M-sense Migräne was not superior to a basic headache diary in reducing migraine frequency after 12 weeks. Future research should explore long-term effects, subgroup responses, and optimized integration of complementary elements such as relaxation and behavioral support to enhance clinical impact.",

    "abstract": "Eosinophilic oesophagitis (EoE) is a chronic, antigen-driven, Th2-mediated condition. Adults with EoE commonly experience dysphagia and food impaction, significantly impairing qualidade de vida. Standard tratamentos, including corticosteroids, elimination diets, and endoscopic procedures can be costly and invasive. Subsequently, adults with EoE may turn to Complementary Medicine (CM). This study investigated the use, beliefs, attitudes, satisfaction, and perceived segurança and efficacy of CM among adults with EoE, including the determinants of CM use. An international, cross-sectional online survey was conducted between May and September 2022. English-speaking adults with an endoscopy-confirmed diagnosis of EoE, residing in Australia, New Zealand, the USA, the UK, or Canada, were eligible to participate. The 33-item survey covered five domains: socio-demographics; health service and tratamento utilisation; perceived efficacy and segurança of tratamentos; and attitudes toward CM. A total of 362 adults with EoE completed the survey. Respondents were primarily from the USA (n = 129, 35.6%) and Australia (n = 113, 31.2%). Most identified as White/Caucasian (n = 324, 89.5%) and female (n = 253, 69.9%). One-half of respondents (n = 181, 50.0%) reported using CM (consulting a CM practitioner, or using a CM terapia or product) for the management of their EoE. By percentage of population, CM use was highest in Canada (n = 33, 73.3%), followed by Australia (n = 56, 49.6%) and the USA (n = 64, 49.6%). CM practitioners most frequently consulted were naturopaths (n = 29, 8.0%), acupuncturists (n = 17, 4.7%), and massage therapists (n = 16, 4.4%). Dietitians or nutritionists were consulted by 139 (38.4%) participants. CM products were used by 151 participants (41.7%), predominantly vitamins (n = 91, 25.1%), probiotics (n = 90, 24.9%), and minerals (n = 55, 15.2%). Herbal medicines were used by 11.6% of respondents (n = 42), with the most frequently used herbs being Curcuma longa (n = 27), Zingiber officinale (n = 16), and Aloe barbadensis (n = 14). CM terapia was used by 13.0% (n = 47) of respondents, most commonly meditação (n = 28, 7.7%) and yoga (n = 14, 3.9%). Dissatisfaction with conventional care (n = 52, 14.4%) and lack of suitable tratamento options (n = 51, 14.1%) were the leading reasons for CM use. The most frequently reported concerns about CMs were efetividade (n = 86, 23.8%), practitioner training (n = 86, 23.8%), and side effects (n = 58, 16.0%). CM use is common among adults with EoE and seems to be largely driven by dissatisfaction with conventional care and limited availability of suitable tratamento options. Although many respondents perceived CM as helpful, concerns regarding efetividade, practitioner training, and side effects were reported. These findings highlight the need for further research to identify safe, effective and acceptable integrative approaches for EoE management.",

    "abstract": "Eosinophilic oesophagitis (EoE) is a chronic, antigen-driven, Th2-mediated condition characterised by eosinophilic infiltration of the oesophagus. Common symptoms of EoE in adults include dysphagia and food impaction, frequently contributing to reduced qualidade de vida (QoL). Conventional management of EoE is often invasive, poorly tolerated, and expensive, with limited evidence supporting the long-term segurança and efficacy of these approaches. Consequently, many individuals turn to complementary medicine (CM). Despite over 50% of adults with EoE reporting CM use, evidence of the clinical efetividade of CM intervençãos for EoE remain scarce. Following a systematic literature review, international survey, and practitioner focus groups, turmeric (Curcuma longa) was identified as a potential candidate intervenção for the management of EoE in adults. A 12-week, open-label, randomised, dose-comparison pilot trial was conducted to assess the feasibility of Meriva® Curcumin Phytosome® in adults with EoE. Participants were randomised into two groups: low dose (500 mg twice daily) and medium dose (1000 mg twice daily). Primary resultados were assessed at weeks 0, 4, 8, and 12 using the Brief Esophageal Dysphagia Questionnaire (BEDQ), Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for EoE symptom severity, EoE-QoL-A (version 2.0), and blood absolute eosinophil count (AEC). Seventeen of the 20 enrolled participants completed the trial (low dose group; n = 10; medium dose group; n = 7). Dysphagia symptoms (partial ETA squared [p²] = 0.130), QoL related to EoE (p² = 0.382), EoE symptom severity (p² = 0.208) and AEC (p² = 0.078), showed considerable improvement within groups over the 12 weeks. Relative to the medium-dose group, the low-dose group demonstrated a greater improvement in dysphagia symptoms (p² = 0.036), QoL (p² = 0.182), and EoE symptom severity (p² = 0.049) over time, indicating that their symptoms eased. The greatest difference in the EoE related QoL between groups was seen at the week 12 timepoint, with a large effect size (p² = 0.268) favouring the low dose group. A moderate AEC time-by-group interaction effect (p² = 0.104) was observed, with a large between-subjects effect (p² = 0.040) indicating the greater benefit in the medium-dose group. Despite a larger initial drop in AEC in the low dose group when compared with the medium dose group, overall AEC increased in the low dose group and decreased in the medium dose group in the final 4 weeks of the trial period, with a large effect size (p² = 0.154) observed between groups at the 12-week timepoint. No serious adverse events were reported. Meriva® was found to be well-tolerated, safe and effective in improving dysphagia symptoms, EoE symptom severity, QoL and absolute eosinophil count in adults with EoE. A dose of 500 mg twice daily offered greater clinical benefit in relation to EoE-QoL, dysphagia and EoE symptom severity as compared with a 1000 mg twice daily dose. Conversely, 1000mg twice daily was found to be more effective in lowering absolute eosinophil count over 12 weeks when compared with 500mg twice daily. Findings from larger, placebo-controlled trials are now warranted to increase confidence in the certainty of this evidence.",

    "abstract": "Homeopathy has historically been used in epidemics, and its potential role during the COVID-19 pandemic raised interest due to the need for low-risk, accessible intervençãos. Mild to moderate COVID-19 cases represent the majority of infections and are typically managed at home with symptomatic support. However, there remains a need for intervençãos that could accelerate recovery and reduce symptom burden in this setting. This study evaluated the efetividade of individualised homeopathic medicines (IHM) in improving clinical resultados and reducing recovery time in patients with confirmed, mild to moderate COVID-19 receiving home-based care. This was a prospective, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled exploratory trial conducted in a São Paulo municipality (Brazil) between February and July 2021. Unvaccinated adults (n=82) with RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and persistent symptoms were recruited from a saúde pública database. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either IHM or placebo. IHM was selected for each patient based on their acute symptom totality using classical repertorisation and Materia Medica. All medicines were prepared individually (centesimal scale) and delivered in identical hydroalcoholic solutions. The placebo group received the same vehicle without active ingredient. All communication and follow-up occurred via phone. Patients self-administered 3 oral drops every 2 hours. Symptom progression was scored at each contact using a 072 scale derived from 24 COVID-19 symptoms (graded 03). Primary resultados were time (hours) from initial appointment to medical discharge (defined as symptom resolution: score 2 in at least two items) and reduction in symptom score over time. Statistical tests included generalised linear models, Poisson regression, and chi-square trend tests (significance: p<0.05). Of the 82 enrolled patients, 68 completed follow-up (32 IHM; 36 placebo). Groups were comparable at baseline in age, sex, BMI, and initial symptom scores. Mean time to medical discharge was significantly shorter in the IHM group (74.5 ± 57.47 hours; 95% CI: 55.7393.27) compared to placebo (137.42 ± 87.85 hours; 95% CI: 106.98167.86), with p<0.05. At 74.5 hours, the IHM group showed a lower symptom score (mean 7.31 ± 5.19) than the placebo group (11.72 ± 5.5; p<0.05). At 137.42 hours, the IHM group continued to show a significantly lower score (2.83 ± 2.79 vs. 5.09 ± 4.78; p<0.05). These findings suggest that IHM led to faster symptom relief and earlier clinical recovery. The difference was consistent across time points and reinforces the potential efetividade of individualised prescriptions in acute epidemic contexts. Individualised homeopathic medicines significantly reduced time to recovery and symptom intensity in mild to moderate COVID-19 managed at home, compared to placebo. The findings highlight the potential role of classical homeopatia as an adjunct therapeutic option in saúde pública emergencies. Further studies with larger samples are warranted to confirm and expand upon these results.",

    "abstract": "Menstrual pain is a common health issue among young women, affecting up to 90% of those of reproductive age. Severe cases may signal an elevated risk of endometriosisa chronic, hormone-dependent inflammatory disease that remains underdiagnosed, often for many years. The MeMaF project (Menstrual health and hybrid care Model for all young Females), developed and implemented in Germany, addresses this care gap. It aims to relieve menstrual pain and to identify and treat girls and young women with a high risk of endometriosis at an early stage through a hybrid, integrative, and interdisciplinary care model. MeMaF is a two-stage Innovation Fund project led by Charité  Universitätsmedizin Berlin, in collaboration with statutory health insurers (BARMER, TK, DAK), the Hasso Plattner Institute, and digital and clinical partners (Registration No. DRKS00033614).  Stage 1 (nVF-1): A digital intervenção delivered via the app period., which includes cycle and symptom tracking, educational content, and integrative self-care tools such as yoga, aroma self-massage, and acupressure. This stage is evaluated in a prospective observational study with 3,000 participants.  Stage 2 (nVF-2): A nested randomized controlled trial (n = 220) targeting participants identified as high-risk for the development of endometriosis. It involves interdisciplinary, multimodal care including extended ultrasound, personalized medical counseling, pelvic physioterapia, nutritional guidance, and psychological supportcomplemented by digital tools. During the implementation of the MeMaF project, a key challenge was the development of a hybrid care model that meets clinical, financial, technical, and organizational requirements. A major task was the simultaneous development of technical and clinical infrastructures to support both care delivery and study operations. The first stage of care was successfully realized as a fully digital app-based model, offering low-threshold and widely accessible integrative self-care and monitoring. The second stage was designed as a clinical, interdisciplinary program with direct linkage to the digital components of nVF-1 through the period.app and centralized evaluation structures. Reaching the target of recruiting 3,000 participants for nVF-1 and 220 for nVF-2 required tailored strategies to effectively engage the adolescent and young adult female population. Dependencies on external service providers posed risks of delays and unforeseen complications. Nevertheless, successful strategies included strong interdisciplinary collaboration, flexible project management, and the application of professional communication expertiseparticularly in outreach and public engagement. The full recruitment target for nVF-1 has already been achieved. Initial insights from the German MeMaF project indicate that a hybrid model combining digital platforms with integrative self-care and interdisciplinary support may be a feasible and acceptable strategy to support menstrual health in young women. While full results from clinical and economic evaluations are pending, the model holds promise for broader implementation and adaptation in international contexts. Integrative therapies such as yoga, acupressure, and aroma self-massage may serve as valuable components in holistic menstrual care frameworks.",

    "abstract": "Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic disease with recurrent abdominal pain, disturbed bowel emptying, and changes in stool consistency. We compared the efetividade of three different dietary tratamento plans (G1-FM-low FODMAP diet, G2-IP IgG based elimination-rotation- diet, and as control group, the G3-K control diet recommended by an attending gastroenterologist) in treating patients diagnosed with mixed irritable bowel syndrome. A total of seventy-three female patients diagnosed with a mixed form of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-M) were enrolled in the study. The diet of each patient in Group 1 (G1-FM) and 2 (G2-IP) was determined individually during a meeting with a dietitian. To determine the individualized G2-IP IgG based elimination-rotation- diet each patient was tested for specific IgG to 270 different foods. Patients from Group 3 (G3-K) received nutrition advice from a gastroenterologist. All diet plans were adjusted to an energy value of 18002300 kcal. Duration of the trial: 8 weeks. Significant differences in the reduction of IBS symptoms were found between the groups. IBS symptoms as well as comorbid symptoms such as headache/migraine, skin condition, constant tiredness or weakness significantly improved or disappeared completely in the G2-IP group (idiopathic abdominal pain, p < 0.001; abdominal pain after a meal, p < 0.001; abdominal pain during defecation, p = 0.008), while in the G1-FM group, only some of the IBS symptoms significantly improved (mucus in stool, p = 0.031; bloating, p < 0.001). In group G3-K no significant improvement was seen. In addition, the G2-IP IgG based elimination-rotation- diet showed improved supply for mono- and poly-unsaturated fatty acids, fibers, vitamin A, D and E, Magnesium, iron and iodine and decreased supply for cholesterol, carbohydrates compared to the Fodmap diet. The G2-IP IgG based elimination-rotation- diet showed improvements in 86% of the cases compared to 38% in the Fodmap diet. Based on the results of this open-label study, it was concluded that various dietary intervençãos in the tratamento of IBS-M patients do not uniformly affect the course and resultados of disease management. In recent years mixed IBS has been characterized as a low-grade inflammatory disease. Pro-inflammatory IgG food hypersensitivity may play a major role in mixed IBS. Rotation diets based on IgG was by far superior to the Fodmap diet and the control diet.",

    "abstract": "Acupuncture is classified as an Integrative and Complementary Health Practice (PICS) originating from Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), which embraces a systemic and holistic view of body-mind-spirit health. In Brazil, acupuntura is recognized as a nursing specialty and includes systemic needling, auriculoterapia/auricular acupuntura, moxibustion, and cupping terapia. The aim of this study was to explore the guiding aspects of the nursing process in acupuntura practice, with the purpose of disseminação robust evidence to support the safe and high-quality delivery of acupuntura care by nurses. This is an integrative literature review, structured around the steps of problem identification and guiding question formulation, use of search strategies with defined inclusion and exclusion criteria, followed by selection, analysis, and interpretation of data. The search for evidence was conducted in April 2025 using the following databases via their respective scientific portals: LILACS through the Virtual Health Library; PubMed, SciELO, Scopus, Web of Science, and CINAHL via the Federated Academic Community (CAFe) of CAPES/Brazil, and supplemented by Google Scholar and documents from health authorities. The methodological quality of the selected publications was not assessed. A total of seven publications were included, categorized into the following themes: implementation of the nursing process directed at acupuntura practice and the need to incorporate knowledge of PICS into nursing education. The evidence demonstrated the importance of structuring acupuntura practice around the following aspects of the nursing process during the initial consultation: integrative data assessment (tongue observation, appearance and posture, pulse palpation, and identification of painful or sensitive points; energy inspection), as well as other subjective and objective data integrated with Western clinical reasoning; formulation of nursing diagnoses and clinical diagnosis based on TCM patterns of energy imbalance; planning of care centered on patient needs with defined goals and expected resultados; therapeutic decision-making; and implementation of optimal acupuntura intervençãos, including point selection, techniques, and frequently anchored in individualized nursing care, interprofessional collaboration, and health programs. In follow-up consultations, the nursing process is applied in acupuntura practice through nursing progress notes that include the evaluation of tratamento efetividade, reassessment of integrative and complementary health data, redefinition of energy and nursing diagnoses when necessary, adjustments to the comprehensive care plan, and decisions regarding the continuation of therapeutic intervenção.The main limitation identified was the small number of studies included. Further implementation and methodological studies on care protocols, adapted to both local and global contexts, are recommended to support and refine the application of the nursing process in acupuntura practice. Best practices in acupuntura performed by nurses should be guided by a nursing process aligned with scientific evidence, the specificities of this therapeutic approach, and diverse socio-environmental contexts. Moreover, this knowledge should be introduced early in nursing education.",

    "abstract": "Cold-water exposure (CWE) has gained increasing popularity as a self-applied intervenção for improving mental health and psychological well-being. While anecdotal evidence and popular media suggest potential benefits for reducing stress, ansiedade, and depressive symptoms, the scientific evidence supporting these claims remains fragmented. This protocol outlines the methodology for a systematic review and metanálise aiming to critically appraise and synthesize the available evidence on the effects of CWE on mental health resultados in adult populations, including both healthy individuals and those with clinical conditions. The review will examine both psychological variables and physiological stress markers in response to cold-water exposure intervençãos. The overarching aim of this revisão sistemática and metanálise is to synthesize the effect of CWE on mental health resultados in adult populations (18 years or older, healthy and clinical population). The primary objective is to assess the effects of CWE on key mental health resultados, specifically depressive symptoms, ansiedade, perceived stress, and general mental well-being, by pooling effect sizes from available studies using validated psychometric instruments. The secondary objective is to investigate the effects of CWE on broader psychological and physiological variables associated with mental health, including sleep quality, thermoregulatory (e.g., core body temperature, skin temperature), metabolic responses, and neurobiological markers such as cortisol, norepinephrine, and inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-6, TNF- or C-reactive protein (CRP)). CWE is defined as full-body or chest-level immersion (25°C), ice baths, cold showers and recreational open-water winter swimming. Any control (e.g. placebo, usual care) serves as comparison. Therefore, following PRIMSA 2020 guidelines, a systematic search will be conducted in PubMed, PsycINFO, Embase, and Web of Science. Eligible studies will include randomized controlled trials, controlled ensaio clínicos without randomization, cohort studies, and case-control studies. Risk of bias will be assessed using RoB1 for randomized controlled trials, ROBINS-I for non-randomized intervenção studies, and ROBINS-E for observational studies. Random-effects meta-analyses will be conducted where sufficient data are available. The review will provide a structured quantitative synthesis of cold-water exposures effects on mental health, helping to bridge the gap between popular claims and empirical evidence. The findings will inform future research, saúde pública guidelines, and the development of safe and effective cold-water exposure protocols for clinical and wellness applications.",

In this report, we examined the resultado measures of psychometric tools from clinician rating, parent reporting, or clinician elicited from parents, compared by tratamento groups. Children aged 6 to 12 with ADHD and emotional dysregulation were randomized to a multinutrient product or placebo for 8 weeks. Blinded resultado measures included: 1) the clinician rated Clinical Global Impression (CGI); 2) parent reported Child and Adolescent Symptom Inventor-5 (CASI-5) and Strength and Development Questionnaire (SDQ), 3) clinician elicited Parent Targeted Problem (PTP) and Pediatrics Adverse Events Scale (PAERS). Of 135 enrolled in the trial, data from 126 children were included in the intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis. Clinician rated CGI-I categorized responders (CGI-I<3) were 54% in the multinutrients group vs. 18% placebo (Cramers V=0.37, p<0.001). The parent-reported CASI-5 composite scores did not differ between groups (p=0.70); both groups improved from baseline (p<0.01). Parent reported SDQ was not significantly different by group for total difficulties (p=0.63); both improved from baseline to end of RCT (p<0.01), trend for greater improvement for all subscales of the SDQ in the multinutrient group compared to the placebo group. The first-nominated PTPs were significantly (p=.02) better for micronutrients (3.73) than for placebo (4.23) on a 9-point scale. The average of all PTPs (1 & 2) was also significantly (p=.05) better for micronutrients (3.85) than for placebo (4.25). PAERS analysis revealed micronutrient group to have a greater overall improvement in the combined score than the placebo group with a between-group difference in change of 0.36 (95% CI: -0.67, -0.04; p=0.03) with ITT data and 0.48 (95% CI: -0.81, -0.15; p=0.005) with per-protocol data. Comparisons of psychometric tools found dissimilar resultados by reporter of the measure. Clinicians rated resultados showed higher proportion of responders in the multinutrient group compared to placebo while parent reported resultados found improvement of overall symptoms from baseline to end of RCT but no difference between groups. Clinician elicited resultados found symptom specific changes differed by group. Measures of efficacious and segurança of a multinutrient tratamento for children with ADHD showed dissimilar results if provided by clinician rating vs. parental report vs. conferred resultados. Thus, future research of TCIM intervençãos should consider the type of resultado measures used to evaluate tratamento efficacy.",

Twelve of 34 participants whith psychological distress were selected: without medication follow-up; diagnosis and/or therapeutic follow-up. The sample was 100% female; mean age 23.4 years; mean 11.5 points on the SRQ-20; 100% felt nervous, tense and worried and 80% reported tiredness without satisfaction to perform daily activities. After meditative intervenção, 84% reported that meditação helped due to the predictability of weekly care, recovery of self-care habits and organization of the mind. A 32% reduction in significant SRQ-20 symptoms. Analysis of the SRQ-20 after and at the end of 12 participants showed a significant reduction in symptoms in the Wilconxon test of p=0.0004. Only systolic BP was significant (initial P=0.0066 and final P=0.0120) and 84% reported attenuation of the impacts of the pandemic on their mental health due to the predictability of weekly care and organization of body and mind through meditação. In the content analysis the description was that meditação was a safe and welcoming space to deal with, the well-being described with occurrences of improved mood and sleep, managing ansiedade, frustrations, irritability and stress, and the importance of predictability of weekly care when 100% of participants reported difficulties in resting and feeling safe in their living spaces as a factor of psychosocial stress. Meditation practices were highly sought after and used as self-care among university students during the pandemic. During this period, there was an expansion in supply, demand, and inclusion in the university context. Different practices have shown acceptance in this group and were effective as a strategy for coping in everyday situations.The acceptance and confirmation of the benefits of meditação in university students may be a response to the growing demand for mental support and care that institutions are facing worldwide. Offering meditative practices can reduce psychological distress in the long term, thus preventing worsening of ansiedade, stress and burnout, impacting on better well-being, promoção da saúde and prevenção for university students.",

    "abstract": "Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a global health concern characterized by central obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and impaired glucose metabolism. These abnormalities significantly increase the risk of cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and all-cause mortality. Women undergoing the menopausal transition are particularly vulnerable to MetS due to hormonal fluctuations that promote adverse metabolic changes. In this context, identifying effective intervençãos to prevent or mitigate these alterations is essential. Yoga has emerged as a promising traditional and complementary practice for improving metabolic parameters in diverse populations. This study evaluated the effects of a structured Shivam Yoga training program over 6, 12, and 24 months on the prevalence of MetS and its individual components in this population. This longitudinal study enrolled sedentary women aged 4065 years diagnosed with metabolic syndrome (MetS) in Ouro Preto, Brazil. Participants were randomly assigned to either a yoga intervenção group or a control group. The intervenção consisted of twice-weekly, 60-minute standardized Shivam Yoga sessions for up to 24 months, while women in the control group maintained their usual activities. Biochemical (fasting glucose, triglycerides, HDL-c), anthropometric (waist circumference), and blood pressure measurements were collected at baseline and follow-up visits. Assessments were conducted at baseline and at 6-, 12-, and 24-month follow-ups. Statistical analyses included both parametric and non-parametric tests, with significance set at 5%. A total of 102 sedentary women aged 4560 years with MetS were assigned to either a Shivam Yoga intervenção or a control group. However, 76, 57, and 37 participants completed the 6-, 12-, and 24-month follow-ups, respectively. The frequency of MetS significantly decreased in the Yoga group compared to the Control group at 6 months (20.8%; p = 0.028) and 24 months (46.0%; p = 0.007). Intragroup analysis revealed a 73.3% reduction in MetS frequency in the Yoga group at 24 months (p = 0.001). Glucose levels significantly decreased in the Yoga group at all time points: 6 (9.66 mg/dL; p = 0.034), 12 (11.61 mg/dL; p = 0.041), and 24 months (21.54 mg/dL; p = 0.001). At 24 months, improvements were also observed in HDL cholesterol (+20 mg/dL vs. Control; p = 0.001), waist circumference (7.40 cm; p = 0.003), and both systolic (19.40 mmHg; p = 0.005) and diastolic blood pressure (10.93 mmHg; p = 0.009). Triglyceride levels remained unchanged across groups and time points (p > 0.05). Long-term practice of Shivam Yoga significantly improved the metabolic profile of climacteric women with MetS. The structured program reduced MetS prevalence and improved key clinical parameters, supporting its potential as a sustainable, low-cost, non-pharmacological strategy for managing MetS and preventing chronic disease in this population.

    "abstract": "Background: Mental stress and burnout are highly prevalent among hospital employees, with nurses and physicians being particularly affected. LAGOM is a tailored prevenção program that combines behavioral and structural prevenção with a focus on mind-body medicine (MBM). Following the evaluation of LAGOM in a feasibility study (DRKS00032014) and in an ongoing pragmatic randomised controlled trial (DRKS00034060), this longitudinal open cohort study aims to generate real-world evidence on the implementation and long-term efetividade of the LAGOM program in a university hospital setting. Conducted as an independent scientific evaluation, this study aims to support the integration of LAGOM into workplace promoção da saúde initiatives at the Charité  Universitätsmedizin Berlin. Methods: This longitudinal open cohort study comprises two cohorts. The first cohort includes all hospital employees who will participate in LAGOM in 2025-2027. It will be complemented by a comparison cohort of hospital employees who do not participate in LAGOM. From this second cohort, a comparison group will be selected using propensity score matching based on key sociodemographic and occupational characteristics (e.g., occupational status, years of experience, working hours). Inclusion criteria for both cohorts include provision of written informed consent and current employment with direct patient contact in a hospital setting. Participation in the LAGOM program is restricted to working hours. LAGOM is a structured nine-week programme designed to prevent burnout. Sessions take place weekly, alternating between on-site and online, and are offered to fixed groups of up to 15 participants. The course incorporates elements of MBM, as well as behavioural and structural prevenção strategies. Measurement time points will include assessments at baseline before LAGOM (week 0), immediately after LAGOM (week 10) and at a follow-up visit 6 months after the program. Data collection will include psychological (burnout symptoms, measured using the Burnout Assessment Tool, BAT), stress (measured using the Perceived Stress Scale, PSS-10), well-being (WHO-5)) and stress-related physiological measures (diurnal cortisol profiles, heart rate variability (HRV)). A health economic evaluation will be conducted to assess the programs cost-efetividade from an operational perspective, considering both direct and indirect intervenção costs. The primary economic resultados absenteeism and presenteeism will be measured using the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire - General Health (WPAI:GH). In addition, job satisfaction and turnover intention will be assessed as further indicators of organisational benefits. The LAGOM program will be evaluated for the purpose of continuous program adaptation based on participants feedback. Results: This is ongoing work, and no results are available yet. Discussion: In addition to providing feasibility and efetividade data, this study aims to generate long-term real-world data on the impact of the LAGOM program, with a particular focus on improving employee mental health and well-being. Long-term data, including health economic assessments and laboratory-based markers, are important for evaluating the programs sustainable integration into workplace promoção da saúde. The study will be submitted to the Charité Ethics Committee and registered on drks.de. The results will be disseminated to the scientific community through peer-reviewed journals and to the general public via press releases. -",

    "abstract": "Traditional randomization methods have faced ethical challenges. Response adaptive randomization (RAR), a dynamic randomization method, not only benefits from clinical research, but also meets the requirement of medical ethics. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) emphasize personalized diagnosis and tratamento, while RAR can more flexibly adapt to patient responses. The perceptions and experiences of participants on randomization methods use are unknown. The existing study of RAR method is scarce. This study is designed to investigate the understanding and application of randomization methods among clinicians and researchers engaged in methodology and drug development, explore their perception on challenges of traditional randomization methods, advantages and potential clinical application scenarios of RAR method, and provide advice for future application. A questionnaire survey was conducted among clinicians and researchers engaged in methodology and drug development, covering basic information, cognitive, clinical practice, and suggestions. Then some of the participants were selected to receive semi-structured interviews. Interview transcripts were analyzed using NVivo 11 software for qualitativo data analysis, employing thematic analysis to identify challenges in randomization methods and explore potential scenarios and challenges for RAR application. Thirty valid questionnaires were collected. Almost all clinicians and researchers engaged in methodology and drug development were familiar with traditional randomization methods (29 [96.67%]). The challenges of traditional randomization methods included difficulty in recruitment, patient tratamento preferences, poor compliance, ethical dilemmas in critical trials, which could limit benefits for placebo groups, and unbalance covariates. Over half of respondents (23 [76.67%]) recognized the potential of RAR to optimize allocation and align with ethical requirements, though most lacked practical experience due to the absence of standardized guidelines and mature platforms. The application of RAR methods has drawn great attention, while the majority of respondents (25 [83.33%]) reported no experience in clinical practice. The challenges of RAR method included insufficient clinical researches on RAR method (25 [83.33%]), the absence of unified standardized guidelines for implementation (25 [83.33%]), and a lack of mature RAR platform (24 [80.0%]). The Semi-structured interviews identified four main themes: understanding and clinical experience of randomization methods, current challenges in randomization, advantages and clinical scenarios for RAR method, and recommendations and potential challenges for RAR promotion. Compared with traditional randomization methods, RAR method was more flexible in ensaio clínicos, allowing participants to be assigned to a better tratamento, which could save samples, improve recruitment efficiency, and apply to complicated clinical scenarios. Future studies should thoroughly investigate RAR method through carrying out well-designed researches, providing clinical cases, and developing methodological consensus and guidelines. Clinicians and researchers engaged in methodology and drug development were familiar with the characteristics, advantages, and challenges of traditional randomization methods. The RAR method demonstrates significant advantages in TCM clinical researches, particularly in screening different TCM prescriptions under the same pattern differentiation, determining optimal dosages for the same prescription, and identifying the most effective among multiple candidate regimens. RAR method has attracted great attention for its clinical and ethical value. Future studies are supposed to fully explore RAR method, and promoting its application in TCM clinical reasearch.",

    "abstract": "The community of Morumbi Educational Institute (IEM) is located at the city of Cascavel - Paraná, Brazil. This is a non-profit project that promotes the education and inclusion of young people and adults from underprivileged communities. Health professionals as Pharmacists and nutritionist part of this project promoted an educational action about hypertension on April, 26th, 2025. The objective of this work is to survey the blood pressure of community participants, classify them and promote an educational talk on hypertension. The lecture subjects was Hypertension, what are the risks factors, classification of the blood pressure, conventional tratamento and the consequences of this clinical condition. The lecture as well demonstrated 5 medicinal plants (Garlic, Celery, Green tea, Burrito and Ginseng) that helps in the hypertension tratamento with scientific support. The lecture was presented with data show for 32 people, mainly women with more than 35 years old. No tratamento was applied before evaluation of the blood pressure (BP). All participants had the BP measured with a sphygmomanometer by health professionals. Everyone was seated and relaxed for 15 minutes before the measurement. The results of the blood pressure of the participants were discussed with the community. From the 32 participants only 12 was with the blood pressure classified as normal ( 120 mmHg / 80mmHg). 3 of them was classified as prehypertension (130  139 mmHg / 85  89 mmHg) and 17 was with blood pressure classified as hypertension. 10 of them in stage 1 (140  159 mmHg / 90  99 mmHg), 3 of them in stage 2 (160  179 mmHg / 100  109 mmHg) and 4 participants was with blood pressure in stage 3 of hypertension ( 180 mmHg / 110 mmHg). 8 people knew they were hypertensive and still had high blood pressure. Only one participant that is hypertensive were with normal blood pressure during this intervenção. Even with technological advances and more information in the health area, it can be noted that needy communities still suffer with lack of support and information. This education action was well received by the community. The professional health team instructed the patients considered hypertensive to seek help at basic unit health centers near their home for a more detailed medical evaluation. As a corrective action, the health professionals shared a folder with information about hypertension and correct tratamento.",

    "abstract": "Older adults increasingly seek Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) advice online, yet their age-related limitations and the fragmented quality of social-media content complicate safe, informed decision-making. Current evidence on how this population navigates mobile platforms for TCM knowledge is scarce. We therefore explored the status, drivers, barriers and unmet needs surrounding older adults access toand subsequent use ofTCM health information delivered via mobile social media. A qualitativo design employing semi-structured interviews was adopted. Forty-four community-dwelling adults aged 65 years from Beijing, Jiangsu and Fujian were recruited via convenience sampling. Interviews (face-to-face or video) followed a seven-question guide, were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and anonymised. A six-step reflexive thematic analysis was conducted by a multidisciplinary team; codes were inductively clustered into sub-themes, themes and overarching domains, with disagreements resolved by discussion. Interviews with 44 older adults generated approximately 30 hours of audio and 330 000 Chinese characters of transcript, yielding 94 codes grouped into eight themes across three domains:current status, related factors, and needs. Current statusParticipants engaged in information-seeking behaviours, preferring disease-management and health-maintenance content in video, text, and audio formats from platforms they habitually used or trusted sources like professional TCM practitioners. They also demonstrated decision-making behaviours, including sharing posts, recording prescriptions, purchasing supplements and consulting TCM practitioners. Resultant influences were both beneficial (enhanced self-care, symptom relief) and detrimental (financial burden, information overload). Related factorsPositive drivers included strong health needs, cultural identification with TCM and trust in authoritative sources. Convenient access to mobile platforms further enhanced older adults' receptivity to digital health messages. However, negative factors such as physical limitations (e.g., declining vision), limited digital literacy, questionable information credibility and over commercialized content diminished their enthusiasm and trust. Neutral factors, including economic considerations and differing family interests, subtly influenced their decisions. NeedsOlder adults expressed clear unmet needs: they desired higher quality, comprehensible, and easily navigable information, emphasizing practical knowledge such as chronic disease management and emotional health support. Technological expectations included senior-friendly interfaces with enlarged fonts, simplified navigation, and enhanced voice-based search functions. They also expressed interest in integrating artificial intelligence tools to facilitate symptom assessment, virtual tele-consultations, and coherent onlineoffline healthcare coordination. Policy-related expectations called for stricter regulation to combat misinformation and preserve TCM traditions. These findings align with global trends showing older adults' growing reliance on digital media, but highlight specific cultural contexts influencing their TCM-related preferences and decision-making patterns, underscoring the need for targeted intervençãos to enhance older adults digital health literacy and TCM engagement. Older adults exhibit active but cautious engagement with mobile-mediated TCM information. Addressing credibility concerns, technological usability and policy support could enhance safe uptake and informed decision-making. Future studies should include populations from diverse economic and cultural backgrounds, evaluate hybrid onlineoffline models, and conduct longitudinal studies on evolving usage patterns.",

    "abstract": "Contemporary molecular biology reveals that DNA expression is not fixed, but highly responsive to epigenetic factors influenced by the environment. This challenges the deterministic view of the genome, showing that gene activity can be deeply modulated by external signals and an individuals subjective perception. Epigenetics emerges as the bridge between genetic code and environmental input, allowing life experiences, emotional patterns, diet, stress, and exposure to energetic fields to dynamically shape gene expression. Mechanisms such as DNA methylation, histone modification, and the action of non-coding RNAs form a plastic interface between external stimuli and internal biology. Pioneering studies by Moshe Szyf and Michael Meaney demonstrated that environmental influences can induce stable epigenetic changes affecting behavior and physiology across generationseven without mutations in DNA sequences. This article is based on a critical review of multidisciplinary scientific literature, including both classical and contemporary sources on epigenetics, vibrational medicine, cellular biocommunication, and pharmacognosy. The analysis focused on research investigating how natural compounds and subtle stimulisuch as biophotons and low-frequency electromagnetic fieldsaffect gene expression, cellular metabolism, and DNA integrity. Authors like Fritz-Albert Popp, Bruce Lipton, Martin Blank, and Reba Goodman served as references to map how vibrational signals can modulate molecular pathways. The article also explores studies on the impact of contemplative practices and adaptogenic medicinal plants on epigenetic regulation and the neuro-immuno-endocrine axis. The findings reveal a growing interconnection between genetics, consciousness, and subtle energy fields. Bioactive compounds such as curcumin, resveratrol, and silymarin exhibit epigenetic properties by regulating key enzymes like histone deacetylases and DNA methyltransferases. These effects include silencing pro-inflammatory genes, reactivating tumor suppressor genes, and restoring dysregulated physiological systems. Additionally, biophoton emissionsultra-weak photons emitted by cells, especially DNAare emerging as a form of intracellular communication and biological coherence. These emissions shift under oxidative stress and may be modulated through meditação and antioxidant herbal therapies. ELF-MF (extremely low frequency magnetic fields), even at non-thermal levels, have been shown to alter DNA structure, enhance transcriptional activity, and activate stress-responsive genes such as HSP70. Together, these insights suggest that the cell functions as a sensitive bioelectronic unitreceiving and transmitting information beyond traditional biochemical pathways. The convergence of genetics, epigenetics, vibrational fields, and fitoterapia signals a silent revolution in medical science. The human body, viewed as a dynamic informational field, can be restored and rebalanced through subtle intervençãos that resonate with its original biological signature. Therapeutic models incorporating these elements hold promise for more personalized, effective, and non-invasive approaches to health. Acknowledging the role of non-material factors in biological regulation is not a departure from science, but an expansiontoward a holistic vision of health rooted in the interplay of energy, information, and matter.",

    "abstract": "Skeletal muscle spasm is a common pathological response to trauma, exercise-induced fatigue, neurological diseases, etc. Chinese tuina terapia has been widely used for relaxation and rehabilitation, yet its underlying metabolic mechanisms remain unclear. This study aimed to explore the effects of tuina terapia on muscle metabolism in a rat model of skeletal muscle spasm. A total of 24 Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into three groups, control(C) group, model(M) group, and tuina(T) group. A rat model of muscle spasm in M and T groups was established via exercise-induced fatigue (EIF), adopting a moderate exercise intensity on the treadmill for two weeks. Kneading manipulation was administered in the T group for 7 consecutive days, and using a massage manipulation simulator on the BL57 acupoint with a force of 4N, 60 times per minute, for a total of 5 minutes. Pain threshold was assessed by mechanical withdrawal threshold (MWT) and thermal withdrawal latency (TWL). Hemorheological parameters were measured to evaluate blood viscosity. Expression levels of lactic acid (LA) and urea nitrogen (BUN) were quantified by biochemical assays. The ultrastructure of gastrocnemius muscle was observed under a transmission electron microscope. Metabolomic profiling of gastrocnemius muscle was conducted using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Compared with the M group, both MWT and TWL in the T group were significantly higer, the oscillation frequency (F), the blood viscosity, plasma viscosity, and the levels of LA and BUN were significantly lower. The electron microscopy showed that myofibrils in the T group were arranged more orderly than M group, with clearer light and dark bands, and increased mitochondria. The metabolomics results showed that there were 136 differential metabolites between the T and M groups, mainly involving in glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway, inositol metabolism, and lipid metabolism. Chinese tuina terapia can effectively alleviate skeletal muscle spasmas well as pain and circulatory disorders caused by muscle spasm. It can improve muscle metabolism by regulating energy-related metabolic pathways and metabolites.",

    "abstract": "Biophotonsultra-weak photon emissions from living cellshave been proposed as mediators of non-chemical cellular communication, while epigenetic mechanisms regulate gene expression in response to environmental factors. The possibility that biophotonic signaling could influence epigenetic states is a novel topic of growing scientific interest. This revisão sistemática aims to synthesize evidence on the interplay between biophoton emission and epigenetic modulation, focusing on cell signaling and genomic plasticity. A revisão sistemática was conducted according to PRISMA guidelines, searching PubMed, Scielo, and Google Scholar for studies published between January 2000 and March 2024. Search terms included \"biophoton\", \"ultra-weak photon emission\", \"epigenetics\", \"gene expression\", and \"photobiomodulation\". Inclusion criteria: (1) peer-reviewed original articles or reviews; (2) studies reporting on biophoton emission and/or epigenetic regulation in response to physical, electromagnetic, or photobiological stimuli. Exclusion: relato de casos, non-peer-reviewed sources, or non-English articles. Study quality was assessed with the GRADE system. Data extracted included sample type, methodology, measurement techniques, and main findings. A total of 284 records were identified; after removal of duplicates and screening, 37 articles met inclusion criteria. Biophoton emission: 22 studies quantified biophoton emission in vitro or in vivo. Most demonstrated increased emission in response to oxidative stress, cell damage, or external stimuli (e.g., low-level light terapia). Epigenetic modulation: 15 studies analyzed gene expression and epigenetic marks (DNA methylation, histone acetylation) following exposure to light or electromagnetic fields. Several found modulation of gene expression associated with changes in methylation status and chromatin remodeling. Link between biophotons and epigenetics: No study directly demonstrated a mechanistic link, but several hypothesize that biophotons may act as signaling molecules affecting gene regulatory networks. Therapeutic implications: A minorities of studies report beneficial effects of low-intensity light exposure on cell proliferation, differentiation, and gene activation. However, results are inconsistent, and clinical translation remains limited. Current evidence suggests a potential, though not yet fully elucidated, relationship between biophoton emission and the regulation of epigenetic mechanisms. While biophotons are confirmed as indicators of cellular state and possible mediators of cell-cell signaling, direct causality between biophoton flux and epigenetic remodeling has not been established. Methodological limitations include small sample sizes, heterogeneity in experimental protocols, lack of standardization in biophoton detection, and limited in vivo data. Most included studies are exploratory, with moderate to low methodological quality (GRADE rating: low-moderate). Limitations: This review is narrative in nature, based on published literature, and does not include metanálise or original data. The evidence is exploratory, and all claims should be interpreted with caution. This review highlights an emerging interface between photobiology and epigenetics, where biophoton-mediated cellular communication may influence genomic plasticity. While current evidence is preliminary and primarily correlative, the results support further investigation into the mechanisms and therapeutic potential of biophoton and photobiomodulation-based intervençãos. High-quality, controlled studies are essential to clarify causality and assess clinical applications.",

    "abstract": "The course \"Self-Care, Health, and Well-Being\" was developed in response to the identified need for self-care strategies among health professionals (HP) within Brazils Unified Health System (SUS), as evidenced by a previous multicenter study examining the effects of violence on community health workers (CHW) health and professional activities. Offered free of charge, the course is self-paced and available via the Fiocruz (Research Institute linked to the Brazilian Ministry of Health) Virtual Campus. Its primary objective is to disseminate foundational knowledge on human physiology, emotional well-being, sleep, breathing, and meditação. The course comprises six theoretical modules and twenty-two practical sessions grounded in Yoga, meditação, and Somatic Education methodologies. In addition to serving as a self-care resource for stress management, the course functions as a continuing education initiative, supporting both individual and group participation with flexible sequencing, duration, and practice combinations. This study presents an evaluation of the courses initial three months of implementation using the RE-AIM framework. Participants are invited to complete pre- and post-intervenção questionnaires to assess self-efficacy, risk of common mental disorders, sleep quality, stress, ansiedade, depressão, knowledge acquisition, and overall satisfaction. RE-AIM was used for detailed implementation analysis focusing on reach, efetividade, adoption, implementation and manteinance. The statistical tests used were: Chi-square, T-test and Paired t-test. The course demonstrated satisfactory reach, with statistical analyses based on 222 baseline and 68 follow-up questionnaires. The majority of participants identified as women (79.73% at baseline and 77% at follow-up), were single (54.05% and 67.65%), held higher education degrees (74.33% and 64.71%), and reported household incomes of up to five minimum wages (64.86% and 77.94%). HP comprised 47.3% of the initial sample and 39.71% of the final sample. Effectiveness was evidenced by reductions in the proportion of participants at risk for common mental disorders (from 43.69% to 30.88%), as well as in severe cases of ansiedade (from 21.12% to 12.94%), depressão (from 16.21% to 10.94%), and stress (from 27.93% to 16.18%). Statistically significant improvements were observed in self-efficacy (p 0.01) and knowledge acquisition (p 0.01). Although the proportion of participants reporting dissatisfaction with sleep increased (from 26.66% to 42.65%), mean comparisons suggested a trend toward improved sleep quality (p = 0.07). Adoption indicators were promising: 91.18% of participants considered the information useful and easy to understand; 88.24% approved of the practical components; 91.18% reported improved emotional regulation; and 85.29% indicated that the knowledge gained was beneficial in addressing daily challenges. Key implementation challenges included technical difficulties with the online platform and insufficient funding for outreach activities. Maintenance strategies have involved social media dissemination and in-person workshops for course promotion targeting HP. The RE-AIM-based evaluation revealed the courses efetividade in enhancing mental health resultados and high levels of participant approval. To expand its reach among HP, including CHW, sustained outreach efforts and institutional coordination are essential. Future quantitative and qualitativo evaluations will be critical in identifying barriers, enablers, and opportunities for refinement to strengthen the courses role as a practical intervenção for self-care and the promotion of collective health and well-being.",

    "abstract": "Based on the latest data from the International Diabetes Federation (IDF), in 2024, 588.7 million adults aged 20-79 worldwide had diabetes, making up 11.1% of this age group. Projections show that by 2050, the total number of adult diabetes patients will hit 852.5 million, accounting for 13% of the population aged 20-79. There is a significant trend of diabetes affecting younger age groups and spreading more widely. Due to the varied quality of evidence in the field of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), the inconsistency and conflicting recommendations often occurs between guidelines. Our aim is to develop an RecMap for TCM tratamento of diabetes covered whole progress stage integrated with AI. In the first phase, planning and investigating. We will explore the needs and expectations from both clinicians and patients. Steering committee will be set up to specify the scope and obligations of this platform. The second, development phase. comprehensive and systematic screening will be conducted from a wide sources of databases such as Embase, Pubmed, Chinese Medical Association Guide, and Wanfang. Guidelines will be evaluated using AGREE-II and AGREE-REX. The recommendations extracted from the guidelines will be evaluated using GRADEPro infrastructure. In the AI training stage, the AI system is integrated into the website to provide accurate responses to the questions according to the guideline and recommendations of the website. Finally, dissemination. Strategies for debugging and testing will be collaboratively developed with stakeholders, and feedback from clinicians and patients will optimize and promote the dual-mode display. In the ensaio clínico and promotion phase, feedback from patients and clinicians will optimize and promote the website. At present, we have completed the first phase and are currently in the phase of platform development and data import in second phase. Based on the analysis of the existing 40 guidelines entered and the evaluation results of AGREE-II and AGREE-REX, we eliminated 10 guidelines that were not recommended in at least one evaluation metric, and finally included 30 guidelines. And attempt to carry out recommendation extraction. Meanwhile, the multimodal large model has entered the training stage. We expect it to not only complete multimodal tasks such as text understanding, visual recognition, generative visualization, and logical reasoning but also achieve excellent training results.

    "abstract": "Pediatric pneumonia remains a clinically common respiratory disease in children and continues to be one of the leading causes of mortality among children under five years of age worldwide . Modern medical approaches primarily employ antibiotics, antiviral agents, and glucocorticoids for tratamento. However, clinical challenges persist, including antibiotic overuse , bacterial resistance, and gastrointestinal complications . In traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), pediatric pneumonia falls under the category of Feiyan Chuansou (panting and coughing due to pneumonia). TCM demonstrates significant advantages in clinical tratamento, post-illness recovery, and alleviation of adverse reactions in pediatric pneumonia. This in vitro study aims to investigate the effects and mechanisms of Yinlai Decoction (YLD)-containing serum on 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) synthesis and secretion in a RIN-14B cell model of gastrointestinal heat accumulation (GHA)-complicated pneumonia, and to explore the experimental mechanisms underlying YLDs therapeutic efficacy against GHA-complicated pneumonia. The drug-containing serum of YLD was prepared via intragastric administration of YLD to Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. A rat model of gastrointestinal heat accumulation (GHA) complicated with pneumonia was established using a high-calorie diet combined with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) nebulization, and the model group serum was subsequently collected. The normal group serum was obtained from rats fed a standard diet and administered saline intragastrically. The effects of serum from different groups on RIN-14B cell viability were assessed using the CCK-8 assay. To replicate the in vitro cell model of GHA-complicated pneumonia, RIN-14B cells were stimulated with model group serum. Cells were divided into six experimental groups: control (untreated), normal (normal serum-treated), model (model serum-treated), YLD (YLD serum-treated), TPH1 inhibitor (LP-533401 hydrochloride-treated), and YLD + TPH1 inhibitor (co-treated with YLD serum and LP-533401 hydrochloride). The expression of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) was quantified using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Western blot analysis was performed to evaluate the protein levels of 5-HT synthesis-related markers (STAT5, pSTAT5 [Tyr694], TPH1) and secretion-related markers (TRPA1, TRPC4). ELISA results demonstrated that compared with the normal group, the 5-HT level in the model group was significantly decreased (P < 0.01). In contrast, the 8% YLD group exhibited a marked increase in 5-HT levels compared to the model group (P < 0.01). Western blot analysis revealed that the protein expression of STAT5, pSTAT5 (Tyr694), TPH1, TRPA1, and TRPC4 in the model group was significantly reduced compared to the normal group (P < 0.01). Compared with the model group, the YLD group showed significantly elevated expression of STAT5, pSTAT5 (Tyr694), TPH1, and TRPC4 (P < 0.01 or P < 0.05), while TRPA1 expression displayed an upward trend without statistical significance. Additionally, compared to the TPH1 inhibitor group, the YLD + TPH1 inhibitor group exhibited significantly increased protein levels of TPH1, TRPA1, and TRPC4 (P < 0.05). YLD enhances STAT5 protein expression and promotes its phosphorylation in the GHA-complicated pneumonia cell model, thereby upregulating TPH1 expression and facilitating 5-HT synthesis. Furthermore, YLD increases TRPA1 and TRPC4 protein expression, promoting 5-HT secretion.",

Following the evidence map methodology adapted by BIREME, a scoping review was carried out, through a broad bibliographic search, without geographical restriction and in different databases, of revisão sistemáticas, other types of qualitativo reviews and gray literature, published in English, Spanish and Portuguese from 2014 to 2024, using terms of DeCS and interculturality in health. This, seeking to identify sociocultural intervençãos, strategies, mechanisms and/or methodologies, that would guarantee indigenous, Afro-descendant and Roma populations (called ethnic minorities in Europe and Anglo-Saxon countries) access to health services with cultural relevance and their permanence and/or integration into the health system; as well as results that evidenced sociocultural adaptations in the intervençãos and health services of national health systems, and that included elements of the traditional medicines of these populations. 9.5% of the studies reviewed, excluding the United States and Canada, come from the region of the Americas, in the form of documents that summarize experiences of primary healthcare, health models or intercultural actions; which could suggest that although there is scientific production in the region of the Americas, it is not common to carry out revisão sistemáticas on interculturality in health, that national health institutions are not documenting the intervençãos developed on interculturality in health with their ethnic populations, they are not publishing the results of research in scientific journals or indexing them in international health databases, or that they are being left in the same way essays, technical documents, degree theses and grey literature, which are wrongly assumed do not generate scientific evidence. It was also evident that the terms/descriptors associated with interculturality in health  most of them typical of the region of the Americas  are not standardized or are grouped into standardized words that, together with their definitions, do not apply or fit all ethnic populations; in addition, that clinical evidence is scarce and not necessarily well cataloged, this being a field still under construction in saúde pública. Preliminarily, we propose that most of the studies carried out in the field of saúde pública seek to evidence intervençãos of specific pathologies in populations but not by adherence to models or health systems of ethnic or intercultural origin; that an ethnic and social approach is needed in health intervençãos and that we must transcend the normative, conceptual and hospital adequacy, to make effective the adequacy of existing health systems that articulate traditional medicines with allopathic medicine and the development of intercultural health models and/or systems.",

    "abstract": "Despite growing interest in medicinal cannabis for companion animals, robust scientific evidence regarding efficacy, segurança, and optimal use remains limited. The endocannabinoid system plays a crucial role in regulating physiological functions in mammals, with cannabinoids like CBD and THC interacting with CB1 and CB2 receptors to produce potential therapeutic effects. This study aimed to establish consensus among specialist veterinarians in Brazil regarding the use of artisanal cannabis oil in companion animals, specifically delineating therapeutic indications, concentrations, dosages, and expected therapeutic responses for conditions where conventional therapies prove inadequate or insufficient. This qualitativo research employed the Delphi method to achieve consensus among experts through sequential, anonymous questionnaires. Eleven Brazilian veterinarians with over one year of experience in cannabis therapeutics for domestic animals and specialized training in medicinal cannabis participated. Participants were identified through searches on Google, Facebook, and Instagram using relevant keywords. Data collection occurred via Google Forms, with participants receiving identical questionnaires and a 60-day response window. For multiple-choice questions, consensus was established when 75% of responses supported one alternative. For rating questions, consensus required 75% of responses as \"agree/strongly agree\" or \"disagree/strongly disagree.\" Two rounds of questioning were conducted until consensus was reached for most responses. Data analysis combined qualitativo and quantitative approaches while maintaining participant confidentiality. The study revealed high consensus levels regarding cannabis oil efficacy for various conditions in dogs and cats. Complete consensus (100%) was achieved for dor crônica, refractory epilepsy, ansiedade, inflammatory bowel disease, oncological support, sequelae of canine distemper, and neurodegenerative disorders in cats. Strong consensus (>90%) was found for aggressiveness, respiratory allergies, and dermatological allergies. Regarding initial chemotype preferences, CBD-predominant formulations were preferred for ansiedade (88.9% for dogs, 66.7% for cats), while balanced CBD:THC formulations were favored for allergic dermatitis in dogs (66.7%). The results align with growing scientific evidence supporting medicinal cannabis in veterinary medicine. Experts emphasized the importance of individualized tratamento approaches, considering condition severity, comorbidities, and individual patient response. The findings highlight the need for larger clinical studies to establish clear dosage guidelines and evaluate long-term segurança and efficacy. This Delphi study provides important evidence supporting artisanal cannabis oil use in veterinary therapeutics for companion animals. The emerging consensus among specialists regarding efficacy for various conditions underscores the importance of individualized tratamento approaches. Despite regulatory challenges and the need for more robust clinical research, cannabis oil represents a promising area in veterinary medicine with potential to improve companion animals' qualidade de vida. This study aims to inspire further investigations and positively impact acadêmico and veterinary practice communities by providing a foundation for future research into this therapeutic alternative.",

    "abstract": "Globally, over 300 million women menstruate at any given time. Many of them experience symptoms such as abdominal pain, backache, nausea which are commonly perceived as normal. Ayurveda considers menstruation a painless, natural event and recommends specific foods to reduce associated discomfort. This study aimed to evaluate Ayurvedic dietary formulationsGreen Gram Soup and Barley Porridge for their efetividade in alleviating menstrual symptoms. To align with modern lifestyles, both products were developed in a ready-to-cook format and assessed for nutritional value, segurança, and stability. A single-arm, prospective study was conducted on 208 young women aged 1420 years experiencing menstrual discomfort. Participants consumed the formulations for lunch and dinner during the first three days of their menstrual cycle, across six consecutive cycles. Symptom scores were recorded at baseline, during intermediate follow-ups (1st to 5th), and post-intervenção (6th follow-up), and analyzed using the Friedman Test and MannWhitney U Test. Nutritional analysis confirmed the presence of essential macro- and micronutrients, supporting the products role in menstrual health. Heavy metal and pesticide analyses showed levels within FSSAI limits or undetectable. Accelerated stability testing at 40±2°C and 75%±5% RH for six months demonstrated product stability. The intervenção led to statistically significant improvement (p < 0.05) in menstrual symptoms - lower abdominal pain, lower backache, breast tenderness, calf muscle pain, headache, nausea, pimples, loose motion, constipation, loss of appetite, and hot flushes. Mudga Yusha (MY) ingredients dominated by spicy and sweet taste, hot potency and pungent bio-transformed taste, Laghuguna (lightness), Deepana (appetizer), Pachan (digestion of ama associated with doshas), Rochan (taste enhancer), Shoolhar (antispasmodic), Shothhar (anti-inflammatory) and Tridoshshamak (Tridosha pacifying) properties. It can help by improving Jatharagi (metabolic factors), pacifying Vata thus relieve Purisha avashtambha (obstruction of feaces). Yava Payas ingredients possessing sweet, astringent taste, Guruguna (heaviness), cold potency and sweet bio-transformed taste, it will be helpful in Koshtha Shodhan (purification of uterus and bowel) but at the same time it will act as Bruhana (nourishment) relieving vitiated Vata. The synergetic effects of both products will be helpful in menstruating women by imparting Kosthshodhana (purification of uterus and bowel), Vatashama (Vata pacification) and Agnivardhana (enhancing digestive/ metabolic factors). Hence these products could have been found effective in alleviating associated symptoms of menstruation. In extension to this, primary ingredients of both articles i. e. green gram and barley have already proven effective in primary dysmenorrhoea. Additionally all the herbs have proven for anti-inflammatory actions. According to National Institute of Nutrition, India guidelines, essential micronutrients like Ca, Mg, Zn, Fe, vitamins B6, A, and C are vital for womens health. Studies by Bianco et al. and Alikamali et al. link deficiencies in fiber, magnesium, B6, and vitamin E to premenstrual symptoms and dysmenorrhea. The presence of these nutrients in MY and YP products likely contributes to their positive effects, potentially through anti-inflammatory, antioxidant actions and nutritional support in managing menstrual symptoms and supporting overall womens health. This study adds a new dimension to the relationship between therapeutic food and menstruation discomfort",

    "abstract": "Anxiety is highly prevalent among medical students and represents a significant risk factor for acadêmico, emotional, and physical impairments. It may lead to comorbidities such as depressão, insomnia, cognitive dysfunction, and physiological alterations associated with chronic stress. In this context, the aim of this study was to investigate the efetividade of flower essence terapia as a non-pharmacological complementary approach, with ansiedade reduction as the primary resultado, and improvements in sleep quality, qualidade de vida, and physiological parameters as secondary resultados. The guiding research question was: Are flower essences effective in reducing ansiedade in medical students, and do they produce positive effects on sleep, qualidade de vida, and physiological indicators This randomized, controlled, triple-blind ensaio clínico was conducted at the University of Southern Santa Catarina (UNISUL) and included first- to third-year medical students, of both sexes, aged 18 to 30 years. Participants were randomly assigned to two groups (flower essence and placebo, n=15 each) using sealed opaque envelopes with pre-distributed numerical codes. The intervençãos consisted of 30 ml bottles, visually identical and neutrally labeled by the manufacturer Gotas do Infinictho®, identified only by the colors blue and green, with the contents known exclusively by the manufacturer. Randomization was performed with allocation concealment, and the study followed a triple-blind model (participants, researchers, and statistical team). The intervenção consisted of daily oral intake of four drops diluted in water for 90 days. Assessments were conducted at baseline, 45 days, and 90 days using validated instruments: the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) for ansiedade, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI-BR) for sleep quality, and the Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) for qualidade de vida. Physiological data were collected using HEG® (neurovascular activity), PPG Stress Flow® (heart rate variability), and BIA-ACC® (body composition). Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism software, applying appropriate tests for between-group and repeated-measures comparisons. The study was approved by the UNISUL Research Ethics Committee (protocol no. 6.594.749), in accordance with Resolution no. 466/12 of the National Health Council. All participants signed an informed consent form. Results indicated a significant reduction in trait ansiedade (STAI-T) at 45 and 90 days in the flower essence group, with no significant changes in state ansiedade (STAI-S). Progressive improvements in sleep quality (PSQI) and increased scores in the mental health and vitality domains (SF-36) were also observed, suggesting sustained emotional benefits from the intervenção. Although the methodological design sought to minimize bias through allocation concealment and the triple-blind model, potential biases related to sample size, the home-based nature of the intervenção, and the shared acadêmico context are acknowledged. These factors will be considered in the final analysis. The findings suggest that flower essence terapia may be integrated as an innovative and safe approach to mental healthcare in medical education. Further studies are needed to confirm its efficacy and support broader application.",

    "abstract": "In therapeutic environments involving Complementary and Integrative Practices (CIP), activities can differ significantly from those in conventional contemporary medical settings, and consequently, their design should address specific needs. However, despite the global expansion of the integrative health approach  consistently so in Brazil  CIP practices are often applied in spaces designed for conventional medical practice, with or without adaptations, which may be inadequate. Studies on CIP environments are scarce, showing gaps in design guidelines and recommendations in this field. Aiming to contribute to the quality of these environments, this work presents a sequence of three studies on therapeutic settings for CIP. The first, conducted using three case studies, identified environmental stimuli that promote user well-being  including those conducive to states of relaxation, contemplation, and meditação. Encouraged by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a psychosocial intervenção for stress management, included in the Traditional, Complementary and Integrative Medicine framework (WHO), and widely studied for their health benefits, meditative, contemplative, and relaxation states remain under-researched in built environments. Therefore, as part of an ongoing doctoral project, a second study was conducted as a Systematic Literature Review (SLR), investigating environmental attributes that influence these states, focusing firstly on built environments in general and secondly on healthcare settings. Thirty-two studies were included in the review, eleven of which focused on healthcare environments. As a result, some categories of environmental attributes influencing the states under study were identified, which were similar to those found in the first research. To support the findings of the SLR, a third study collected data through questionnaires and interviews conducted with fifteen integrative health therapists. Nearly twenty hours of interviews were analyzed using content analysis, resulting in a categorization that aligned with the SLR findings. The three studies suggest that environmental attributes can support meditative, contemplative, and relaxation states in integrative health therapeutic settings. These attributes may be particularly relevant to practices that aim to induce such states as a therapeutic goal or as support for the primary technique. The studies also identified closely related categories of attributes. Summarizing the results, the first category comprises Tangible and/or Observable Attributes, which includes the following subcategories: Aromas, Art, Cleanliness, Colors and Materials, Furniture, Lighting, Nature, Organization, Outdoor View, Privacy, Sounds, Temperature, and Spatial Configurations. The second category includes Intangible and/or Non-Observable Attributes, encompassing the subcategories: Atmosphere, Spiritual, and Welcomeness. Some attributes were found to be more influential before the practices, while others were during. Therefore, transitional spaces leading to the tratamento areas may also predispose patients to the desired states. Furthermore, the influence of the environment tends to be greater for individuals with less experience accessing meditative, contemplative, and relaxation states. Despite limitations such as small sample sizes, limited representation of CIP specialties, and the heterogeneity of the SLR sample, the findings open up a range of possibilities for environmental attributes, which are being further explored in the ongoing doctoral research. The Ethics Committee CEPSH/UFSC approved the first and third studies. The SLR was registered on the OSF platform.",

    "abstract": "The Marcgraviaceae is a tropical American family of approximately 130 species used in traditional medicine, but the family has only recently received scientific interest. We searched the genera of Marcgraviaceae on Pubmed and Google scholar for peer reviewed papers published between 1960 and April 15, 2025, reporting ethnobotany, phytochemistry of pharmacological activity of Marcgraciaceae. Selected theses were reviewed. Information from our published studies was included. Traditional uses are recorded in five studies for diverse Indigenous nations such as Taiwanos of Colombia and Qeqchi Maya of Belize. Uses include topical application for skin conditions, tratamento of sleep and ansiedade disorders, fevers and intestinal disorders. The family has been studied in at least 5 in vitro studies, 10 preclinical studies in animals and 2 animal trials for veterinary applications. Our research has provided evidence for inhibition of bacterial quorum sensing by Marcgravia sp., with active principles identified as naphthoquinones. Souroubea sympetala and S. gilgi were found to have anxiolytic activity in rodent models such as the elevated plus maize. Active principles were identified as betulinc acid and amyrins, acting through the GABAA receptor. Other researchers have demonstrated anti-viral and antimalarial activity of Schwarzia brazilensis and antiparasitic activity of Ruyschia phylladenia against Leishmania amazonensis but the active principles are still unknown. Souroubea sympetala is one species that has advanced to practical application as a tratamento for noise aversion in canines. These ethnobotanical and scientific results show the medicinal potential of the Marcgraviaceae in future studies.",

    "abstract": "A defining feature of axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) is sacroiliitis identified on radiography. Early diagnosis is difficult absent radiographic evidence. HLA-B27 assessment and MRI assist in identifying axSpA prior to radiographic abnormalities but are not cost-effective for screening. Delayed diagnosis can adversely impact tratamento which may include exercise, postural training, physical terapia and pharmaceutical management such as NSAIDs or tumor necrosis factor inhibitors in patients who do not respond to first line care. Targeted diet and lifestyle modifications may also be delayed. Inflammatory Back Pain (IBP) screening has been used in atenção primária orthopedic clinics in Europe to identify those with chronic low back pain (CLBP) who should receive HLA-B27 and MRI assessment for axSpA. The proportion of IBP screened patients with an abnormal MRI is established in these atenção primária orthopedic clinics but there is no comparable data for patients seeking chiropractic care. The aim of this study is to identify the proportion of patients with an abnormal pelvis MRI among those with CLBP presenting for chiropractic care with possible IBP in the US. 100 adult patients under age 45 with CLBP underwent IBP screening. 75 patients answering 3 of 5 questions affirmatively were referred for pelvic MRI and HLA-B27 testing. MRI images were interpreted by two experienced readers and categorized by the Assessment of SpondyloArthritis International Society (ASAS) definitions of axSpA. Sacroiliac joint MRI abnormalities meeting the 2009 ASAS definition of a positive MRI were observed in 10 patients (13.3%). Hip joints were sufficiently demonstrated in 69 subjects that had a pelvic MRI. Bone narrow edema and hip effusions were observed in nine patients (13.0%). HLA-B27 positivity for subjects with suspected IBP and abnormal pelvis MRIs was 10%. This is the first study to identify the proportion abnormal pelvic MRI in patients with CLBP suggestive of IBP presenting for chiropractic care in the US. Although the study design did not include a diagnosis of axSpA, it suggests clinical protocol to select patients with suspected IBP who may benefit from HLA-B27 and MRI assessment for axSpA. Those who screen positive for suspected axSpA may benefit from further evaluation and, if appropriate, earlier integrative intervenção. The patients seen in the chiropractic clinic did not have a previous diagnosis of axSpA, were not treated with accepted biologic therapies for their symptoms, were not referred to or previously screened by a specialist to determine who should receive an MRI. As a result, we believe that selection biases were reduced which resulted in a prevalence that likely reflects the prevalence of abnormal MRIs in other atenção primária populations.",

    "abstract": "A homeopathic medicinal product (Camilia) is used to relieve painful gums, irritability and minor digestive symptoms associated with teething. With teething, the inflammatory microenvironment is usually associated with pain. This study investigated the effects of this homeopathic medicinal product and its single active ingredients Chamomilla 9C, Rheum 5C, and Phytolacca decandra 5C on inflammation markers. In this aim, we measured the oxidative stress in inflamed microglial cells and InterCellular Adhesion Molecule-1 (ICAM-1) in inflamed endothelial cells. Microglial cells, resident macrophages present in the central nervous system, are well known to be hypersensitive to reactive oxygen species (ROS) and participate in the immune response. Both ROS and ICAM-1 markers are involved in the inflammatory process in specific microenvironments. To assess inflammation, oxidative stress and ICAM-1 were measured in microglial cells and in endothelial cells, respectively. The cells were either inflamed with 10 ng/mL LPS (endotoxin) or 1ng/mL TNFalpha. The homeopathic preparations 6% (v/v), positive control (dexamethasone) or vehicle were tested under these inflammatory conditions. The production of mitochondrial and total intracellular ROS was analyzed with MitoSOX (6h) or CellROX (24h) probes using fluorescence microscopy, respectively. ICAM-1 protein was quantified using ELISA assay. The experiments were independently performed three times. In inflamed microglial cells, the homeopathic medicinal product, Rheum 5C, Phytolacca decandra 5C and Chamomilla 9C significantly decreased by 26 to 35% the ROS production in mitochondria compared with the vehicle. Furthermore, the homeopathic medicinal product, Rheum 5C and Chamomilla 9C significantly decreased the total intracellular ROS production by 20 to 29% compared with the vehicle. with as well as with compared with the vehicle. In contrast, no significant effects with either the homeopathic medicinal product, Rheum 5C, Chamomilla 9C or Phytolacca decandra 5C were obtained in the TNFalpha-inflamed endothelial cell model. These results showed that the homeopathic medicinal product and all its active ingredients, Rheum 5C, Chamomilla 9C, and Phytolacca decandra 5C, exhibit antioxidative properties in inflamed microglial cells by reducing the production of ROS. Notably, the homeopathic medicinal product and all homeopathic preparations act specifically on ROS mitochondrial production at 6h. Except for Phytolacca decandra 5C, all other active ingredients of the homeopathic medicinal product retained antioxidative properties after 24h. Since significant findings obtained with inflamed microglial cells, further experiments are in progress to investigate a panel of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukins and chemokines.",

    "abstract": "Psoriasis is an inflammatory skin disease where oxidative stress plays a pivotal pathophysiological role. Within the paradigm of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), natural antioxidants are increasingly utilized as adjuvants to conventional therapies. Lycopene, a powerful lipophilic antioxidant, has demonstrated anti-inflammatory properties. However, the role of dietary antioxidants in integrative approaches to psoriasis management remains underexplored. Our objective was to evaluate the potential of lycopene as a nutritional CAM intervenção by investigating its nonlinear relationship with psoriasis prevalence. The data were collected through the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (20032006; 20092014). Dietary lycopene levels were analyzed as a representative non-pharmaceutical CAM modality, with multivariate logistic regression and restricted cubic spline analysis examining its association with psoriasis. Subgroup analysis assessed the consistency of this relationship across populations with varying CAM utilization patterns. There were 17,694 participants, with 2.9% (508/17,694) who experienced psoriasis. Compared with individuals with lower lycopene consumption Q1 (<0.77mg/day), the adjusted odds ratio (OR) values for dietary lycopene intake and psoriasis in Q3 (2.72-6.98mg/day) varied across different models: 0.73 (95% CI: 0.570.94, p =0.015), 0.77 (95% CI:0.590.99, p =0.040), 0.76 (95% CI: 0.59-0.98, p =0.033), and 0.77 (95% CI: 0.590.99, p=0.046). The association between dietary lycopene intake and psoriasis exhibited a U-shaped curve (nonlinear, p<0.05), with an inflection point of roughly 4.47 mg/day. The U-shaped association (inflection at 4.47 mg/day) reflects the dualistic nature of nutritional intervençãos in traditional medicine systems - while moderate intake aligns with the CAM principle of \"food as medicine\", excessive consumption may disrupt redox balance. This parallels dose-dependent effects observed in fitoterapia, underscoring the importance of standardization in CAM protocols. This study reveals a U-shaped relationship between dietary lycopene consumption and the prevalence of psoriasis among adults in the United States. However, more prospective population studies are needed to verify these findings and explore the underlying mechanisms.",

This revisão sistemática and network metanálise aimed to evaluate the efetividade of various acupuntura-related therapies in managing drug addiction. Ten databases (including PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, China Science and Technology Journal Database, SinoMed, Weipu, WanFang, Oriental Medicine Advanced Searching Integrated System, KoreaMed, and Korean Studies Information Service System) were searched from inception to March 26, 2025, for acupuntura-related therapies for drug addiction. Method quality was assessed using the Cochrane Handbook Risk of Bias 2.0. A pairwise metanálise was performed using RevMan 5.4 software. Network metanálise was conducted using the R software. A total of 35 randomized controlled trials encompassing 15 intervenção types and 2812 participants were included. The most frequently targeted acupoints were PC6, ST36, and SP6, while the commonly used auricular points included TF4 (Shenmen), AH6a (Jiaogan), and CO14 (Lung). The network metanálise results indicated that the most effective intervençãos for withdrawal symptoms were transcutaneous electric acupoint stimulation, manual acupuntura, and auricular acupuntura combined with usual care. For depressão, manual acupuntura combined with usual care, electroacupuntura, and usual care alone were the most effective. For ansiedade, auricular acupuntura combined with usual care, Western medicine, and usual care ranked the highest. Acupuncture combined with usual care showed superior efficacy in managing the overall symptoms of drug addiction, although the optimal approach may vary according to the specific symptom type. Manual acupuntura combined with usual care was particularly effective for depressão, whereas auricular acupuntura combined with usual care was the most effective for ansiedade.",

Fermented foods, such as sauerkraut, are rich in bioactive compounds with potential anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects. However, clinical studies exploring their impact on allergic conditions are lacking. The objective of this study is to investigate whether daily consumption of fermented red cabbage (sauerkraut) alleviates allergic symptoms and modulates inflammation and gut microbiota composition and function in young adults. In this 8-week, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, 158 participants aged 1835 with diagnosed allergic condition will be assigned to consume either fermented red cabbage (ramping up to 75g/day) or a sensory-matched, non-fermented red cabbage product. Symptom severity (Total Nose and Eye Symptom Score, TNESS) is the primary resultado. Secondary resultados include daily symptom ratings, medication use (via mobile Ecological Momentary Assessments, mEMA), qualidade de vida (WHOQOL-BREF), gastrointestinal complaints (GSRS), psychological wellbeing (ADS, GAD-7), and biomarker analyses (CRP, IgE, immune cell counts). Stool and product samples will undergo metagenomic sequencing to evaluate microbiota composition and function. Additionally, participants' experiences and perceived effects will be assessed qualitativoly through questionnaires and interviews. Recruitment and data collection are ongoing. Final results will evaluate feasibility and potential clinical and microbial benefits of incorporating fermented red cabbage into the diet of individuals with allergies. This study aims to generate first clinical evidence on the therapeutic relevance of fermented red cabbage for allergy management and to advance understanding of dietmicrobiomeimmune system interactions.",

    "abstract": "The professional training of human resources in health in Latin America and the Caribbean, which includes graduates in medicine, nursing and obstetrics, is eminently biomedical, i.e. a teaching based on the conventional Western model where the health/disease/care process is oriented towards biological aspects with an evident reduction of the psycho-social and cultural components. However, in some universities and schools of higher education, subjects related to traditional medicine (TM), alternative, complementary and integrative medicine (CAM) have been included as compulsory subjects. For this work -requested by the Andean Health Organization-Hipólito Unanue Agreement (ORAS-CONHU)- the curricula of 725 schools in the Andean region, including universities offering 288 medical, 358 nursing and 79 midwifery degrees in Bolivia (108), Chile (149), Colombia (135), Ecuador (77), Peru (161) and the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (95), were reviewed via the Internet. A total of 213 university sites and sub-sites were found to offer the mandatory subjects of MT and MAC (almost 30%). In general, 61 courses were detected in medicine (29%), 134 in nursing (63%) and 18 in obstetrics (8%). With a greater presence in Peru, Venezuela, Ecuador, Bolivia, Chile and almost nonexistent in Colombia. In most cases, the specific contents of the subjects are unknown. It is concluded -comparing with a similar study in 2011 with 40 courses- that the progress is enormous and significant. It shows that there is a growing interest in the Andean Region to incorporate the topics of traditional medicine and complementary alternatives in the professional training of doctors, nurses and obstetricians of conventional schools, especially in the care provided in the nursing career.",

    "abstract": "During the climacteric phase, women face an increased risk of metabolic syndrome (MetS) due to hormonal changes that contribute to abdominal obesity, impaired glucose metabolism, and dyslipidemia. This period is also characterized by symptoms such as hot flashes, night sweats, mood disturbances, sleep difficulties, and genitourinary complaints, which can reduce qualidade de vida and exacerbate metabolic risk. Together, these challenges highlight the need for integrative, non-pharmacological strategies. This study evaluated the long-term effects of a structured yoga program on menopausal symptoms in climacteric women with MetS over 6, 12, and 24 months. A total of 102 sedentary women aged 4560 years with diagnosed MetS were allocated to either a Shivam Yoga intervenção group or a control group. Shivam Yoga is a form of yoga based on Traditional Indian Yoga and grounded in the Samkhya and Tantra philosophies. The intervenção group participated in guided 60-minute sessions twice weekly, comprising mental concentration (Dharna, 5 min), energy transmission rituals (Pujas, 4 min), breathing exercises (Pranayamas, 15 min), physical postures (Asanas, 20 min), deep relaxation (Yognidra, 8 min), and meditação (Dhyana, 8 min). Climacteric symptoms were assessed at baseline and at 6, 12, and 24 months using the Kupperman Index (KI), with scores 19 classified as mild, 2034 as moderate, and >34 as severe. Changes in total and individual symptom scores were evaluated through within- and between-group comparisons. The study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the Federal University of Ouro Preto (CAAE: 95824318.2.0000.5150). Due to loss to follow-up, 36 and 40 participants remained in the Yoga and Control groups at 6 months, 24 and 33 at 12 months, and 15 and 22 at 24 months, respectively. All baseline parameters were similar between groups. At all time points, the Yoga group showed significantly lower median KI scores than the Control group (p < 0.05), indicating reduced symptom severity and frequency. The proportion of participants with moderate or severe symptoms was also significantly lower in the Yoga group at 6 months (p < 0.001) and 12 months (p = 0.036). Among individual symptoms, nervousness showed the most pronounced improvement: scores were significantly lower than those in the Control group at 6 (32.3%; p = 0.006), 12 (39.8%; p = 0.003), and 24 months (39.1%; p = 0.020), with sustained reductions from baseline. At 6 months, further improvements in insomnia (23.6%; p = 0.034), depressive symptoms (29.0%; p = 0.070), and palpitations (23.2%; p = 0.019) were noted. Benefits persisted or intensified at later time points, with the Yoga group reporting significantly fewer palpitations (32.2%; p = 0.043) and arthralgia/myalgia (46.0%; p = 0.007) at 24 months. Regular practice of Shivam Yoga over 24 months was associated with sustained improvements in climacteric symptoms, particularly nervousness, palpitations, and musculoskeletal discomfort, in women with MetS. These findings support yoga as a promising complementary approach for long-term symptom management during the menopausal transition and post-menopause. Acknowledgments: UFOP and FAPEMIG.",

    "abstract": "The global use of medicinal cannabis has rapidly expanded alongside growing interest in its therapeutic potential. This study presents a comprehensive overview of international research trends and clinical evidence supporting the application of medicinal cannabis across diverse medical conditions Literature searches were conducted in three English-language electronic databases (Pubmed, Embase, and Cochrane Library) to identify all bibliometric analyses, revisão sistemáticas, or meta-analyses related to medicinal cannabis for any indication. Reviews were classified as systematic if they included a clearly defined and reproducible methodology, including a search strategy and explicit inclusion and exclusion criteria. Studies involving participants with any type and severity of medical condition were included. The primary resultados extracted from each revisão sistemática or metanálise were evidence of efetividade and segurança. A total of sixty-one eligible studies were included in the analysis. Bibliometric analyses (5 studies) reveal a significant increase in scientific publications since 2019, with the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada leading the field. Evidence mapping (2 studies) from revisão sistemáticas indicates potential efficacy in managing multiple sclerosis, chronic non-cancer pain, HIV-related neuropathic pain, chemoterapia-induced nausea and vomiting, epilepsy, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Clinical practice guidelines (4 studies) and revisão sistemáticas (6 studies) suggest that medicinal cannabis may be beneficial for intractable chemoterapia-related symptoms such as nausea and insomnia in cancer patients. However, evidence remains limited or inconclusive for its broader use in oncology, including appetite stimulation, pain relief, and qualidade de vida enhancement. Economic evaluation (1 study) has identified cost-efetividade in the tratamento of refractory symptoms associated with chronic conditions such as multiple sclerosis and Dravet syndrome. Further evidence supports the use of medicinal cannabis in select neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders (21 studies), including PTSD, Parkinsons disease, epilepsy, and sleep disorders, though findings are mixed for conditions such as schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorders, and cognitive impairments. In pain management (16 studies), cannabis has demonstrated efficacy in chronic non-cancer pain, with additional studies suggesting reduced opioid use and improved sleep and appetite. Research in other conditions (8 studies)such as inflammatory bowel disease, geriatric care, palliative care, menopause, and retinal diseasesremains insufficient to draw definitive conclusions. This review underscores the growing scientific interest in medicinal cannabis while highlighting the urgent need for high-quality, longitudinal, and comparative studies to establish its long-term segurança, standardized dosing, and baseado em evidence clinical guidelines.",

    "abstract": "Centella asiatica is an Ayurvedic medicinal herb, used to enhance cognition and improve mood. Our group has shown that a water extract of Centella asiatica (CAW) can attenuate age-related deficits in learning, cognitive flexibility, and recognition memory in mouse models of aging and neurodegenerative disease. We have also demonstrated that CAW improves mitochondrial function and activates antioxidant response in the brains of treated mice and the effects on antioxidant pathways appear to be central to the mitochondrial and cognitive effects of the extract. Here we build on that work to evaluate the vascular effects of CAW in aged mice and elucidate the contributions of selected constituent compounds, triterpenes (TT) and caffeoylquinic acids (CQA), to the cognitive effects of the CAW extract. Three and eighteen-month-old male and female C57BL6 mice were treated with CAW (10g/L) for in their drinking water for 5 weeks and then cerebral perfusion, cerebrovascular reactivity was quantified by MRI. Plasma was collected and 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) was quantified as a marker of oxidative stress. In a separate cohort, 18 month old male and female C57BL6 mice were treated with TT, CQA, or TT+CQA in their drinking water at a concentration proportional to their relative abundance in CAW (10 mg/mL) for 5 weeks. In the final two weeks of tratamento, mice underwent behavioral assays to assess learning and cognitive flexibility. CAW tratamento increased cerebrovascular reactivity in aged mice. These effects were accompanied by a reduction in circulating 8OH-dG. Both TTs and CQAs separately improved learning and cognitive flexibility in aged mice but interestingly the combination of TT+CQA did not improve cognitive performance. The improvements elicited by the compound groups did not reach the same magnitude as what was previously observed in response to the entire CAW extract. This work demonstrates that improvements in vascular function as well as a reduction in oxidative stress are seen in aged mice in response to CAW. These effects may contribute to the improved cognitive performance we have previously reported. The compound testing suggests that both TTs and CQAs contribute to the cognitive improvements evoked by CAW in aged mice but that their effects may be modulated by other constituents within the extract. Determination of active compounds and identification of translationally relevant biomarkers, like vascular imaging and circulating markers of oxidative stress, will help inform standardization of CAW for future clinical testing. In fact, a segurança and tolerability ensaio clínico is currently underway assessing many of these same endpoints as secondary resultados.",

    "abstract": "Meditation use has grown significantly in recent decades. However, population prevalence data is largely absent in Australasia. We aimed to address this gap by conducting a nationally representative survey. We surveyed adults in Australia (n = 2,072) and New Zealand (n = 571) in 2023, using census-informed quotas for age, gender, ancestry/ethnicity, region and income. We calculated lifetime and past-year meditação use estimates and conducted univariable analyses and multivariable logistic regression to investigate predictive factors. We estimate that 41.5% of Australian (about 8.6 million) and 35.7% of New Zealand (about 1.5 million) adults have ever used meditação, while 32.8% (about 6.8 million) and 24.9% (about 1 million), respectively, used meditação in the past year. In multivariable regression, only education (Australia: Odds Ratio (OR) = 1.37; New Zealand: OR = 1.57) and age (Australia: OR = 0.78; New Zealand: OR = 0.59) predicted past-year use in Australia and New Zealand. Multivariable regression indicated several sociodemographic characteristics (Australia: gender, ancestry/ethnicity; New Zealand: LGBTQIA+ status) and health factors (Australia: cannabis use, psychedelic use, mental healthcare utilisation, complementary/alternative healthcare utilisation; New Zealand: physical healthcare utilisation) that were related to past-year meditação use. Over 21.7% of Australian (about 1.5 million) and 17.6% of New Zealand (about 0.2 million) meditators experienced a meditação-related adverse effect. Australia and New Zealand have amongst the highest rates of meditação use globally, with signs that meditação being used as an adjunct and/or alternative to mental health services. There is a need for more research into specific meditação practices and their application to mental health. Clinical guidelines on best practice for meditação use would help to maximize benefits and minimise harms.",

    "abstract": "Contemplative practices can be used as complementary medicine to support communities mental health in stressful contexts. However, engaging with communities to understand their needs and sociocultural contexts, and building on any contemplative practices already existing locally, is essential to ensuring contemplative practice intervençãos will gain traction and yield enduring benefit. Despite this, few studies have engaged with communities to discover what they might need from contemplative practices and what forms of contemplative practices might be most acceptable and valuable in different socio-economic, demographic, cultural, and geographic contexts. We conducted a proof-of-concept study for co-designing contemplative practices with communities. We aimed to (1) demonstrate the potential of the approach and (2) obtain feedback from community members and practitioners involved to refine our methodology. Employing a participatory action research methodology, we collaborated with semi-rural communities in the Huon Valley, Tasmania, which were affected by environmental and social challenges. We consulted with the community to understand their local mental health needs and how contemplative practices could support them. We then co-developed a short contemplative practice intervenção. To inform future iterations, we evaluated the co-design process through a collective reflective exercise, incorporating regular individual and group reflections. Additionally, we assessed the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efetividade of the intervenção through surveys and focus groups. Community consultations engaged diverse community members. Concerns converged on the limited resources available to those with caring roles in the community, whether professional or personal (e.g., caring for a loved one). Local contemplative practitioners co-designed the intervenção, a workshop for carers that combined nature connection with atenção plena-based practices. Our reflections concluded that the community consultation and co-design process was successful in shaping the intervenção in ways unanticipated by researchers. Desafios included gaining trust from the most vulnerable sectors of the local community, who were frustrated with previous consultations; bridging differences between various sub-communities; tolerating uncertainties during the process; addressing local language sensitivities; collaborating with local healthcare and wellness institutions and providers while maintaining independence of the process; and communicating clearly about what we could and could not do for the community. This project provides initial insights to develop a framework to guide the co-creation of contemplative practice intervençãos with diverse communities. Working at local community levels could lead to more effective, sustainable, and culturally relevant complementary mind-body health intervençãos based on contemplative practices.",

    "abstract": "Climacteric is a transitional period marked by hormonal changes that can adversely affect women's metabolic health, increasing the risk of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus. With population aging, a growing number of women are experiencing menopause, underscoring the importance of strategies to manage the associated metabolic changes. Evidence suggests that yoga practice may help modulate metabolic parameters. In this context, the present study aimed to evaluate the effects of 24 weeks of Shivam Yoga practice on glycemic regulation in climacteric women. Forty-one women aged 4065 years with impaired fasting glucose (>100 mg/dL) were enrolled and allocated to either a yoga group (n = 18) or a control group (n = 23). The yoga group participated in twice-weekly 60-minute Shivam Yoga sessions for 24 weeks. Each session included the following components: mental concentration (Dharana, 5 minutes), energy transmission rituals (Pujas, 4 minutes), breathing exercises (Pranayamas, 15 minutes), psychophysical postures (Asanas, 20 minutes), deep relaxation (Yognidra, 8 minutes), and meditação (Dhyana, 8 minutes). The control group was instructed to maintain their usual daily activities throughout the study period. All participants were interviewed, and blood samples were collected before and after the intervenção for fasting glucose and insulin measurements. From these values, the HOMA-IR and QUICKI indices were calculated to assess insulin resistance and sensitivity, respectively. Although diet was not controlled, other lifestyle factors were monitored. Medication use was tracked, and participants who initiated any new regular physical activity during the study were excluded from the analyses. The yoga group showed significant reductions in fasting glucose (107.5 mg/dL to 102.5 mg/dL, p=0.001), insulin (8.02 mIU/mL to 6.96 mIU/mL, p=0.009), and HOMA-IR (2.26 to 1.74, p=0.002), along with a significant increase in the QUICKI index (0.34 to 0.36, p=0.004), indicating improved insulin sensitivity. No significant changes were observed in the control group. Between-group comparisons at the end of the study showed significantly better resultados for the yoga group in fasting glucose, HOMA-IR, and QUICKI. These findings are consistent with previous studies reporting improved insulin sensitivity following yoga practice across various populations. The beneficial effects observed may be linked to stress reduction, inflammatory modulation, and improved autonomic nervous system function. Regular yoga practice appears to support glycemic control and improve insulin resistance in climacteric women, suggesting its value as a complementary strategy for managing metabolic disorders during this life stage.

    "abstract": "Temporomandibular disorders (TMD) are a group of conditions that affect the temporomandibular joint (TMJ), masticatory muscles, and adjacent structures. Although the incidence of TMD is low (3.9%), its global prevalence is estimated at 34%, reaching 47% in South America. This characterises it as a saúde pública problem and highlights the need for accessible and effective therapeutic approaches. This scoping review aimed to map and synthesize the scientific evidence on the efetividade and implementation features of group-based intervençãos for the relief of the signs and symptoms of TMD. Indexed descriptor-based search strategies were used in the following databases: PubMed, LILACS, EMBASE, Scopus, SciELO, Web of Science, Cochrane Library and Google Scholar, up to July 2024, with no language restrictions. Articles were selected using the Joanna Briggs Institute criteria. To conduct a detailed analysis of implementation, we used the RE-AIM framework, which focuses on aspects such as reach, efetividade, adoption, implementation, and maintenance. This review is registered on the OSF site under the identifier: DOI: 10.17605/OSF.IO/SB3DM. Eight articles were included in the final analysis, comprising data from 389 individuals. Six were uncontrolled ensaio clínicos, one was a pilot study and one was a randomised ensaio clínico. The intervençãos in the trials mainly reached women, as they are 56% more likely to be affected by TMD than men. In terms of efetividade, group-based therapeutic strategies such as cognitive behavioural terapia (CBT), atenção plena, yoga and health education have showed promising benefits, including reduced pain, catatrofising, stress, ansiedade, depressão, and improved mandibular range of motion. In addition, economic and social benefits were highlighted, such as cost reduction, improved time efficiency in care, and increased social support among patients. Reports of negative effects are absent. None of the trials reported adoption criteria regarding the institutions promoting the intervençãos. Only one study reported implementation criteria in terms of physical space, training and skills of the professionals involved in the delivery of the intervençãos. No data were reported on the maintenance of the intervençãos by the institutions where the trials were conducted. Only two trials followed up participants. They showed sustained benefits in terms of pain remission for a health education intervenção at 4 months and for a CBT intervenção at 12 months. However, the heterogeneity of the diagnostic criteria, the lack of control groups and the lack of follow-up in most of the included studies reduces the generalisability of the results. We concluded that integrative practice group intervençãos for the management of TMD signs and symptoms may positively impact saúde pública due to the aforementioned benefits and low cost. However, further studies with more rigorous methodologies are needed to confirm the efetividade of these intervençãos and detail basic implementation criteria. The RE-AIM framework has enhanced the evaluation of intervençãos. In addition to efetividade, it enables the evaluation of critical intervenção features important for adapting them to different contexts. We strongly recommend using implementation science frameworks to design future studies.",

    "abstract": "This study aims to explore the distribution and trends of clinical studies on Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) for Alzheimers related diseases. Seven databases (CNKI, VIP, WanFang data, SinoMed,Cochrane library, PubMed, and Embase) were searched from the inception to October 13, 2024. We included clinical studies of all types of pharmaceutical or non-pharmaceutical tratamentos guided by TCM theory for treating/preventing Alzheimers disease (AD). The population in the studies can be AD, senile dementia and mild cognitive function. A total of 938 studies met the inclusion criteria, involving 59179 (Mean Value (M)=182.09, Standard Deviation (SD)= 1838.48) elder patients with senile dementia, 48307(M=88.80, SD=126.17) AD and 7166 (M=102.37, SD=89.99) mild cognitive function. Most studies (675, 71.96%) were conducted in hospital. Clinical study types involved randomized controlled trials (RCT, 892, 95.10%), non-randomized control trial (non-RCT,19,2.13%) and Case Series (17,1.81%). A total of 60 diagnostic criteria were involved including 29 Western medicine criteria, 12 TCM, and 7 integrated Chinese-Western medicine. TCM syndrome patterns were considered in 178 studies (18.98%). Self-designed herbal prescription was mostly involved (253 studies, 26.97%), followed with Chinese patent medicine (220 studies, 23.45%) and Chinese fitoterapia classic prescriptions (192 studies, 20.47%). The duration of TCM-guided intervençãos ranged from 3 days to 144 weeks (Median: 12w). seven resultados were reported with various measuring time range (Quality-of-life, measuring time point range 2week (w) -100w; Clinical symptoms of western medicine, 2w  52w; Clinical symptoms of TCM,4w  48w; Laboratory Index,2w  72w; Clinical effective rate,1w  72w; Adverse event, 2w  100w; and Cognitive function,1w  100w). Cognitive function resultados involved 86 assessment scales, with the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) being the most utilized (660studies, 70.36%). A total of 553 studies reported Clinical effective rate, and 124 studies reported composite clinical effective rate (22.42%) . Most studies (720 studies) reported that TCM-guided intervençãos improved cognitive function in AD-related patients. RCTs lacked rigor in blinding resultado assessors (773 studies with high risk of bias, 82.41%). Clinical research on TCM for AD-related disorders is with large quantity and variety in TCM terapia schemes, but inconsistencies in diagnosis as well as methodological deficiency remain. Future study should focus on efetividade evaluation regarding specific categories in population and TCM intervençãos, and real-world data should be paid more attention for long term evaluation",

    "abstract": "Health literacy is increasingly recognized as a key social determinant of health, directly influencing individuals ability to make informed decisions about their health and well-being. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines health literacy as the capacity to obtain, understand, and apply health-related information to promote and maintain qualidade de vida. The growing acknowledgment of integrative and complementary health practices, as supported by the Brazilian National Policy on Integrative and Complementary Practices (PNPIC  Ordinance 971/2006 and subsequent updates), has amplified the discussion on the importance of health literacy as a strategy to promote health and support autonomy in therapeutic choices. In this context, the homeopathic medical rationale stands out for adopting a patient-centered clinical model that emphasizes active listening and integrality. This approach encourages meaningful dialogue between practitioner and patient, deepens the understanding of the health-illness process, and fosters shared responsibility in care. This study aims to analyze, from the perspective of health literacy, the potential of homeopatia to contribute to health education and autonomy promotion, particularly in atenção primária settings. This is a qualitativo, exploratory study based on a narrative literature review. Searches were conducted in the PubMed, SciELO, and HomeopatiaBVS databases using the descriptors homeopatia, health literacy, and integrative practices. The search included articles published between 2014 and 2024, in Portuguese, English and Spanish. Official documents from WHO and the Brazils Unified Health System (SUS) were also included. Inclusion criteria comprised peer-reviewed articles addressing the relationship between homeopatia and health literacy, helath education, or patient empowerment. Studies focusing solely on clinical efficacy were excluded. A total of 94 records were identified; after screening and full-text review, 17 articles were included in the final analysis. Data were extracted using structured reading sheets and a thematic content analysis was conducted to identify central categories. Two main aspects of homeopatias contribution to health literacy were identified: (1) the promotion of dialogue and qualified listeninghomeopathic consultations foster the expression of personal narratives and support a broader understanding of illness; and (2) the stimulation of empowerment and shared responsibilityhomeopatias individualized prescriptions and explanation of therapeutic rationale promote active engagement in care. Studies also show that individuals with higher health literacy levels tend to use integrative therapies more safely and consciously. Homeopathys integrative model promotes reflective and critical dialogue by linking physical, emotional, and social dimensions of care. This strengthens patient understanding of their health process and contributes to autonomy building. Nevertheless, persistent challenges include misinformation about integrative practices, limited professional training, and institutional barriers to implementation. Strengthening health literacy as a structural axis of saúde pública policy can help legitimize practices such as homeopatia and ensure their safe, ethical, and effective use. Homeopathy demonstrates strong potential for promoting health literacy by encouraging autonomy, critical thinking, and a broader understanding of health and disease. Its integration into health education actions and atenção primária services can contribute to more humanized, participatory, and effective healthcare. Investing in professional training and fostering environments that support therapeutic dialogue are essential steps for realizing this potential.",

In 94% of the studies, nursing professionals expressed favorable attitudes toward ICHP, although they reported insufficient acadêmico training specific to these practices. The integration of ICHP into nursing practice contributes to the development of more sustainable, humanized, and equitable healthcare systems. These approaches reinforce active listening, therapeutic relationships, and person-centered care, while expanding promoção da saúde to encompass biopsychosocial dimensions. Such contributions foster a paradigm shift in healthcare delivery and provide evidence to inform public policies aimed at planetary health.",

    "abstract": "Cold temperature hypersensitivity (hiesho in Japanese) is a common complaint in Japanese traditional Kampo medicine, particularly among women. It is often associated with dor crônica and overall symptom burden and plays a key role in Kampo pattern differentiation and individualized tratamento. However, there is a lack of systematic studies integrating traditional clinical perspectives with modern biomedical approaches to this condition. We have reported several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) including rs4818919 on TRPM2 and rs1869201 near KCNK2 genes which are associated with cold temperature hypersensitivity in Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) of women from the general population. This study aims to investigate clinical characteristics and genetic factors associated with cold temperature hypersensitivity among patients at our Kampo clinic in Keio University Hospital. A longitudinal observational study is being conducted at the Center for Kampo Medicine in Keio University Hospital (IRB approval: 20241178). A total of 200 participants with cold temperature hypersensitivity aged between 20 to 59 will be included. Exclusion criteria include patients with heart failure, thyroid function disorder, malignancies, or pregnancy. Clinical data and questionnaires including a visual analog scale of cold temperature hypersensitivity, and the somatic symptom scale-8 responses will be collected, along with saliva samples for a genotyping array that analyzes specific SNPs reportedly associated with cold temperature hypersensitivity. A polygenic risk score will be also calculated to assess the cumulative genetic predisposition. Preliminary data show that cold sensation is more frequently reported by female patients, and patient recruitment is progressing as planned. The integration of traditional Kampo patterns and genetic profiling may provide a biomedical understanding of cold temperature hypersensitivity and may support more precise therapeutic strategies for dor crônica.",

    "abstract": "The field of traditional, complementary, and integrative medicine (TCIM) has experienced steady growth since the 1940s; as of 2024 there have been over 200 000 research articles published on this topic. During this period, traditional citation-based metrics have been the assumed norm used to measure the impact of research. However, in the information age, alternative metrics (altmetrics) offer a unique opportunity to evaluate the social impact of research in the digital landscape and enable real-time responses to shifts in public interest by analyzing patterns in the online discourse surrounding TCIM research. This insight is valuable to researchers, stakeholders, and policymakers alike. The objective of this study was to conduct an altmetric analysis of research outputs under the TCIM subject area to reveal patterns in social engagement and identify factors that drive impact online. This study was conducted using Altmetric.com where a single search was executed using the subject Traditional, Complementary, and Integrative Medicine. The data returned from this search was analyzed to reveal patterns concerning journal/collection title, open access status/type, attention scores, output type, subject area, and mentions across all platforms by average, and by country. For articles with an Altmetric attention score of 10 or higher, the most frequently mentioned health concerns and TCIM therapies (based on the keywords present in these publications), and the language of publication were identified through a Scopus search using DOIs. For the top 20 articles with the highest Altmetric attention scores, the date of publication and type of study were also identified. The greatest number of mentions were contributed by X (n = 350 630, 70.41%), Facebook (n = 57 540, 11.55%), and news outlets (n = 39 941, 8.02%). Research in the form of a news output (M = 203.67) or published under an open access status (M = 11.76) was associated with the highest average Altmetric attention scores. The Journal of Natural Products had the greatest number of mentioned outputs (n = 5314, 10.56%), total mentions (n = 60 782, 12.21%), and mentions on X (n = 47 197, 13.46%). Following the 4208 Traditional, Complementary, and Integrative Medicine subject area, most articles were classified under 3214 Pharmacology and Pharmaceutical Sciences (n = 8628, 13.85%), and 3202 Clinical Sciences (n=3917, 6.29%). Approximately 1% of the articles were written on the topic of COVID-19 (n=707, 1.13%). Among the articles with an attention score of 10 or above, the most frequently mentioned health concerns were low back pain (n=571), pain (n=496), and depressão (n=389), and the most frequently mentioned TCIM terapia was acupuntura (n=2666). This study provides insight into how TCIM research is received beyond acadêmico audiences by identifying factors associated with increased online engagement. By implementing characteristics reported in this study which are consistent with increased online attention, researchers can align dissemination efforts with public interest, thereby increasing visibility and ultimately helping bridge the gap between research and policy. Future research may include investigating the demographic factors behind the uptake of TCIM research online.",

    "abstract": "Complementary, alternative, and integrative medicine (CAIM) has been growing in popularity worldwide. Despite this, researcher and clinician (R&C) perceptions of CAIM have not been studied across medical disciplines on a global scale. Understanding these viewpoints may provide insight into the foundational understanding of CAIM among R&Cs and the necessity of CAIM-based educational resources to support professionals internationally. The purpose of this study is to analyze CAIM perceptions among R&Cs from seven medical disciplines through seven cross-sectional surveys. Participants were sent an electronic survey through email addresses extracted from articles indexed in MEDLINE and published in journals focused on the discipline being studied (i.e., cardiology, neurology, oncology, pain, pediatrics, psychiatry, or surgery). Basic descriptive statistics and thematic content analyses were used to analyze quantitative and open-ended qualitativo responses, respectively. A combined total of 5184 R&Cs participated across all seven surveys. In all disciplines except psychiatry and pain, most participants had never received formal (range across disciplines: 70.33%80.70%) or supplemental (52.49%67.06%) CAIM training and had never conducted CAIM-based research (68.82%77.01%). Yet, most participants from all disciplines believed there was value in providing formal (52.31%64.14%) and supplementary education (61.81%71.01%) to clinicians and conducting CAIM research (77.89%88.41%). Preferences for CAIM therapies varied by subcategory, with mind-body therapies being viewed as the most promising (47.11%78.04%) and biofield therapies as the least (4.49%7.58%) across all surveys. In open-ended responses, the need for expanded research and educational resources for CAIM intervençãos and concerns regarding CAIM segurança/regulation were recurring themes in all disciplines. Results suggest that there is a need to develop CAIM research and educational resources to support R&Cs. Future studies may use interviews and focus groups to further explore R&C perceptions beyond these surveys and determine how such resources may be effectively implemented internationally.",

    "abstract": "Homeopathy is a form of complementary medicine that, despite the controversial debate in the media, is frequently used in several countries worldwide. The debate, which is mainly conducted in the public media, is multifaceted and involves concerns about the scientific plausibility, efficacy and ethical considerations. To overcome the current impasse, citizen science may offer a promising means of encouraging dialogue and collaboration. Accordingly, our objective was to develop a very simple plant bioassay that would facilitate replication and multi-centre trials by the general public without the need for sophisticated equipment. Cress seeds (Lepidium sativum L.) were grown in vitro within Ca(NO3)2 salt tolerance levels, resulting in a moderate reduction of the seedling length compared to cress grown in water. Screening experiments were conducted with seven homeopathic preparations (Aurum muriaticum natronatum, Nitricum acidicum, Carbo vegetabilis, Natrium muriaticum, Nux vomica, Phosphorus and Silicea) in the potency levels 10x, 20x, 30x (applied as commercially available globules) with 160 cress seeds per condition. Outcome was the total seedling length. The experiments demonstrated unequivocal, highly significant growth-modulating effects compared to control (unimpregnated globules) for multiple preparations in different potency levels. The results of this very simple plant bioassay establish a basis for future citizen science endeavours, such as replication and multicentre trials, that the general public can undertake in the domain of homeopathic basic research. Further replication experiments are necessary to identify potential influencing factors, including seasonal effects.",

    "abstract": "Temporomandibular disorders (TMD) consist of a set of facial alterations, including the temporomandibular joint, with pain and/or inflammation. The tratamento is based on the use of several classes of medications for symptom relief, which may cause efeitos adversos. Thus, it becomes necessary to use a non-drug tratamento such as acupuntura, whose efficacy in relieving TMD symptoms has been observed.The parameters evaluated were mouth opening, visual analog pain scale (VAS), serum cortisol and glucose levels, and dentristy evaluation. The duration of tratamento were 12 sessions for each type of acupuntura; with the interval of a week between each session, been the same for all types of acupuntura. Three types of acupuntura were used: laseracupuntura using red laser 660 nm wavelength and infrared laser 808 nm wavelength, 3 joules dose used for systemic acupoints; stainless needles 25x30 mm for systemic acupoints; and auriculoterapia using mustar seeds in a microssystem technic. This study proposed to evaluate the efetividade of various acupuntura techniques in the tratamento of TMD and to generate tratamento protocols with this practice. Ethics committee approval number is 3.147.379. A total of 122 women were recruited in 2019, and according to the eligibility criteria, only 45 were eligible for tratamento, with only 33 completing the study. It is worth noting that this study was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic and was suspended, making it impossible to increase the sample size. The tratamentos were carried out in 12 sessions, with a session a week, during three month, divided into the groups: needles (N=8), Auriculoterapia (N=12) and Laseracupuntura (N=13). The auricular points used were Shen Men, Kidney, Liver, Relaxation, Occipital, Lower Jaw, Tooth, Neurasthenia, Anxiety and Joy. The points used for acupuntura with needles and laser were the same: Taiyang, Small Intestine 19, Stomach 6, Large Intestine 4, Liver 3, Pericardium 6 and Gallblader 34. Statistical method used for analyzing the data were Variancy analysis, post test Tukey and Test T Student. The statistical analyses considered p-value<0.05 for the tratamento groups. The tratamento resulted in the following changes: comparing tratamento times, there was an increase in mouth opening after 12 sessions with auriculoterapia and laser acupuntura tratamentos, with a significant difference compared to needle tratamento, indicating improved joint function; there was a reduction in VAS after 6 and 12 sessions with auriculoterapia tratamento, with a significant difference compared to tratamentos with needles and laser acupuntura, suggesting pain relief; there was a reduction in serum cortisol levels after 6 sessions with needles, with a significant difference compared to tratamentos with auriculoterapia and laser acupuntura, a marker of stress and inflammation levels; there was a reduction in the dentristy evaluation scores before and after 12 sessions of tratamento, indicating improvement in TMD after tratamento, and there was no significant change in serum glucose levels, as the patients were normoglycemic. These findings suggest the effective and safe use of acupuntura for TMD tratamento, indicating three different types of approaches, promoting pain relief, improved joint function, and reduced inflammation.

    "abstract": "Hemorrhoidal diseases, rectal prolapse, and outlet obstruction constipation impose substantial burdens on patients. Xiaozhiling (XZL) injection, a traditional Chinese terapia, is increasingly integrated with surgical techniques, yet its comparative efficacy and segurança remain understudied. This revisão sistemática synthesizes evidence on XZL-based intervençãos versus conventional surgeries. We systematically searched Chinese (CNKI, VIP, Wanfang, CBM) and international databases (PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library) for studies comparing XZL (alone or combined with procedures like procedure for prolapsing hemorrhoids, ruiyun procedure for hemorrhoids, tissue selective terapia) to conventional surgeries. Data extraction, bias assessment (Cochrane ROB tools), and metanálise (ReviewManager 5.3) were conducted. Evidence quality was graded using GRADE. Among the 200 studies included, the application of XZL injection terapia and its combination with different surgical methods were as follows: 29 studies (14.5%) used XZL monoterapia, primarily for internal hemorrhoids (17 studies), rectal prolapse (7 studies), and outlet obstruction constipation (5 studies). XZL combined with PPH (procedure for prolapse and hemorrhoids) was applied in 11 studies (5.5%), while 25 studies (12.5%) involved XZL in combination with RPH (rubber band ligation). Additionally, 11 studies (5.5%) combined XZL with the TST (transanal stapled technique). The most frequent combination, seen in 80 studies (40%), was XZL with the traditional external hemorrhoidectomy/internal hemorrhoidectomy (Milligan-Morgan hemorrhoidectomy). Lastly, 44 studies (22%) utilized XZL combined with conventional Western surgical methods, primarily for rectal prolapse (12 studies) and outlet obstruction constipation (32 studies). Outcomes of primary concern included length of stay, postoperative pain and edema, postoperative complications, and recurrence. From 200 studies addressing nine clinical questions, key findings included: Pain reduction: XZL combined with Milligan-Morgan hemorrhoidectomy significantly reduced postoperative pain (MD =-0.96 [-1.45, -0.48], 5RCTs, very low quality evidence). XZL alone showed no difference (MD = -0.28 [-1.31, 0.74]), 3 RCTs, evidence quality was very low. Hospital stay: XZL with Milligan-Morgan hemorrhoidectomy shortened hospitalization (MD = -3.01 [-4.00, -2.03], 10RCTs, very low quality evidence), while XZL-TST yielded no significant difference (MD = -2.00 [-4.13, 0.13], 5RCTs, very low quality evidence). Constipation: XZL combined with traditional hemorrhoidectomy reduced bowel difficulty scoring (SMD = -0.69 [-1.37, -0.02] , 7RCTs, very low quality evidence). Evidence distribution revealed heterogeneity in study designs and resultados. Most findings were graded as low/very low quality due to small samples, methodological flaws (e.g., allocation concealment issues), and inconsistent reporting. Notably, XZL combined with Milligan-Morgan hemorrhoidectomy consistently outperformed conventional surgeries in pain control and hospitalization, but these benefits require validation in robust trials. XZL injection, particularly combined with Milligan-Morgan hemorrhoidectomy, may enhance postoperative recovery for hemorrhoids. However, evidence limitations underscore the need for larger, rigorously designed trials to confirm efficacy and expand applications to rectal prolapse and constipation.",

    "abstract": "Anxiety disorders remain a leading contributor to global disability, affecting over 300 million individuals. In Latin America, particularly Brazil, Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) shows high prevalence, with limited tolerability of conventional tratamentos such as SSRIs and benzodiazepines due to efeitos adversos like serotonin syndrome and withdrawal phenomena. Sphaeranthus indicus Linn. (Mundi), is a classical Ayurveda herb prescribed for Manovikara (psychosomatic disorders) and Chittodvega (ansiedade states). Thus, a series of studies are conducted to validate its anxiolytic potential. This study adopts a translational triadclinical, preclinical, and in-silico approachesto validate the anxiolytic efficacy of S. indicus, bridging Ayurvedic neuroscience with modern psychopharmacology. Therefore, a complete profile for understanding Sphaeranthus indicus as a Natural Anxiolytic is developed and will be presented in the conference. The evaluation of Sphaeranthus indicus Linn. (Mundi) is done on clinical, pre-clinical and by In Vitro methods. In clinical study, the randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled ensaio clínico on 50 patients with General Anxiety disorder (GAD) having (DSM-IV-TR; HAM-A 17) was done. The study was conducted for 8 weeks and changes in HAM-A scores, core ansiedade symptoms, and secondary parameters (NIMHANS Psychological Tool, Manas Bhava Parikshana) were analysed. Preclinical evaluation was done on Swiss albino mice (n=6/group), the aqueous extract (SIAE), hydroalcoholic extract (SIHE), was evaluated with positive control (diazepam, piracetam). Behavioural assays included Elevated Plus Maze, actophotometer, and Morris Water Maze. Cortical and hippocampal histology was examined. To know the probable pathway of action In-silico analysis of phytochemicals (e.g., pheanthine, neral, eugenol, 4-methoxycinnamaldehyde) were screened using IMPPAT database. ADME study was done using SWISS Target prediction and toxicity study was done using Protox database. Gene targets were screened using Swiss Target Prediction. Pathway enrichment mapped interactions with serotonergic, dopaminergic, and monoaminergic targets The ensaio clínico showed significant HAM-A score reduction in the intervenção group (HAM-A: 63.2% vs. 18.4% placebo; p < 0.001). Marked improvements were noted in fear (80.0%), anxious mood (63.2%), insomnia (72.9%), and depressive symptoms (62.2%) (p < 0.005). No undesirable events or vital deviations were reported. In vivo, SIAE increased open-arm exploration (11.94 ± 4.45 s vs. 4.22 ± 0.97 s; p < 0.01) and reduced locomotor activity, suggesting GABAergic action. SIAE and SIHE shortened escape latency in the Morris Water Maze, indicative of cognitive enhancement and NMDA receptor engagement. Histology confirmed neuroprotection without cytotoxicity. Computational docking identified multiple bioactives targeting serotonin receptors (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR3A), MAOA, MAOB, COMT, and CCKBR. Key pathways included serotonergic transmission, monoamine modulation, GPCR signalling, and neurodegeneration attenuation. Notably, pheanthine, neural, and 4-methoxycinnamaldehyde were linked to dual serotonergic and monoaminergic activity. This integrative study supports S. indicus as a safe, pleiotropic anxiolytic, modulating GABAergic, serotonergic, and neurotrophic mechanisms. Findings justify a comparable anti-ansiedade potential of S. indicus to SSRI in reducing ansiedade and enhancing qualidade de vida. By aligning Ayurvedic insights with neurobiological precision, this work pioneers culturally congruent, baseado em evidence phytotherapeutics for global mental healthcare.",

    "abstract": "Evidence synthesis for whole medical systems is challenging. There are currently no revisão sistemáticas that comprehensively evaluate homeopatia as a patient-centered whole medical system in accordance with contemporary scientific standards. We therefore decided to develop a framework that highlights the importance of complexity, context and patient perspectives, as is appropriate for many TCIM systems, including homeopatia. This framework will provide the required context for a revisão sistemática program on the effects of homeopathic preparations in a range of clinical indications. A systems perspective considers the patient as a complex system of interconnected regulative subsystems embedded in a complex environment, and disease as a dysregulation of the dynamic adaptive state of the organism. Most TCIM systems, including homeopatia, aim to stimulate regulative systems and their functions to re-gain homeostasis, rather than to structurally change something within the organism. The consequences of this with regard to the approach to evidence synthesis were explored, and its implementation is illustrated by the planned revisão sistemática program on the effects of homeopathic preparations. A systems perspective requires additional real-world evidence, which is why the revisão sistemática program will include non-randomized prospective comparative studies (NRSIs) as well as Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs). A patient advocate will be involved during the entire research program and input from patients with living experience with homeopatia for the clinical indication concerned will be incorporated in each of the revisão sistemáticas. The RCT and NRSI evidence on homeopathic products for a range of clinical indications will be synthesized, using a decontextualized approach. Therefore, a limitation is that these findings will still need to be positioned within the broader context of the existing state of knowledge in order to inform decisions, recommendations and tratamento guidelines. The latter can be based on the evidence-to-decision framework or similar approaches. The framework developed can be used to inform revisão sistemática programs of TCIM modalities. The revisão sistemática program of homeopatia is expected to make a significant contribution to informing societal discussion about the role of homeopatia in healthcare systems.",

    "abstract": "Menopause is characterized by a decline in estrogen levels and is commonly associated with vasomotor, physical, sexual, and psychological symptoms that may adversely impact women's qualidade de vida and mental health. Considering this impact, along with the contraindications and efeitos adversos that may be associated with conventional pharmacological tratamentos, there is growing interest in traditional, complementary, and integrative medicine as suitable approaches for managing climacteric symptoms. Although the number of studies in this field has increased, robust and well-controlled evidence regarding the efficacy and segurança of certain practices, such as Reiki terapia and aromaterapia, remains limited, particularly when these intervençãos are applied in combination. In this context, this pilot study aimed to evaluate the effects of Reiki terapia and inhalation of Citrus sinensis essential oil on climacteric symptoms in women aged 40 to 67 years. Nine women were recruited through active search and randomly assigned to one of five intervenção groups: (1) Reiki, (2) aromaterapia, (3) Reiki/aromaterapia combination, (4) placebo for Reiki, and (5) placebo for aromaterapia. Aromaterapia involved the use of Citrus sinensis essential oil, administered both during face-to-face weekly sessions (via a diffuser for 30 minutes) and at home (by placing five drops of the essential oil on a piece of paper beside the pillow overnight). This protocol was followed by participants in Groups 2 and 3. Group 5, which received placebo aromaterapia, followed the same procedure, with both forms of application, using almond oil instead. Reiki terapia consisted of activating six body points for five minutes each during face-to-face sessions, while the placebo group received sham Reiki. Additionally, participants in Groups 1, 3 and 4 were instructed to lie down for 20 minutes at a prearranged time to receive remote Reiki or sham Reiki, respectively. Group 3 followed both the aromaterapia and Reiki protocols. The intervençãos lasted eight weeks. Climacteric symptoms were assessed using the Menopausal Rating Scale (MRS) at baseline and after eight weeks. All tratamento groups demonstrated improvements from baseline to the 8-week timepoint across all Menopause Rating Scale (MRS) domains: general, somatic, psychological, and urogenital symptoms. The combined techniques group showed mean score reductions of 9.33, 3.33, 5.34, and 2.33 points, respectively. Reiki alone resulted in the greatest overall improvement, with reductions of 12.00 (general), 4.50 (somatic), 3.50 (psychological), and 0.50 (urogenital) points. Aromaterapia yielded less pronounced reductions: 6.00, 1.00, 3.00, and 1.00 points, respectively. Placebo groups also experienced slight improvements, though in fewer domains and to a lesser degree. The Reiki placebo group showed improvements in general (2.00) and somatic (1.00) symptoms, while the aromaterapia placebo group showed a 2.00-point reduction in psychological symptoms only. These modest effects may be attributed to the relaxing nature of the sessions. Reiki and aromaterapia show promising potential for alleviating climacteric symptoms and, consequently, improving women's qualidade de vida during this phase. Further studies with larger sample sizes are needed to confirm these findings and establish their statistical significance. Acknowledgements: UFOP, CAPES, CNPq and FAPEMIG",

    "abstract": "High-quality randomized controlled trials ( RCTs ) are the best way to evaluate the clinical efficacy of intervençãos. However, the quality of published RCTs of traditional Chinese medicine is uneven, and strict randomization and blinding are often not implemented, which has a high risk of bias. Blinding method is an important part of RCT, which can avoid the influence of human factors on the objectivity and efetividade of the test results, so as to ensure the internal validity and repeatability of the study. The purpose of this study is to introduce the blind quality evaluation method of ensaio clínicos of traditional Chinese medicine and to explore its application in clinical practice. All Chinese medicine ensaio clínicos published in Chinese and English were included in this study. These trials were evaluated by blind method and the results were reported. We searched randomized controlled trials ( RCTs ) from the establishment of the database to May 2025 in CNKI, Wanfang, VIP, Sinomed, Pubmed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library. The main results are the James Blindness Index ( James 's BI ) and the Bang Blindness Index ( Bang 's BI ). A total of 84 eligible randomized controlled trials were included in this study. The average value of James 's BI was 0.54, the average value of Bang 's BI in the experimental group was 0.48, and the average value of Bang 's BI in the control group was-0.21. The results showed that the implementation of the overall blinding method was reasonable, but the subjects in the experimental group were more likely to guess the group allocation than the control group. Blind evaluation can not only reflect the accuracy of blind results and data, but also increase the credibility of research results. However, the implementation of blind method in the field of traditional Chinese medicine is not perfect. It is suggested to improve the level of placebo production and use JBI and BBI for quantitative blind evaluation in future blind ensaio clínicos of traditional Chinese medicine.",

    "abstract": "Classical Osteopathic manipulative techniques, specifically those targeting the hepatic region such as sub-hepatic pyloric release, liver decongestion, and liver elevation in the supine position, are commonly employed in the management of visceral dysfunctions. Despite their widespread clinical application, the immediate physiological and clinical sequelae of these intervençãos remain largely uninvestigated. This study aimed to ascertain the immediate hemodynamic profile of the portal vein subsequent to the application of specific osteopathic visceral techniques within the hepatic region, as assessed via Doppler ultrasonography (US). This randomized, blinded pilot ensaio clínico enrolled 15 healthy volunteers (12 females, 3 males; mean age 34.00 ± 5.40 years) who were systematically allocated into three distinct intervenção groups (n=5 per group): Group M1 received sub-hepatic pyloric release; Group M2 underwent liver decongestion; and Group M3 received liver elevation in the supine position. Each participant underwent two Doppler US examinations, conducted by a qualified radiologist: one preceding and one immediately subsequent to the therapeutic intervenção. During each assessment, portal vein diameter and blood flow velocity were quantitatively measured using a Medison X8 Doppler US system (Samsung, Korea). Systemic arterial pressure was concurrently measured using a standard sphygmomanometer (HEM-7113, Omron, USA). Furthermore, the cross-sectional area, volumetric flow, and congestion index of the portal vein were computed Mean pre- and post-intervenção measurements were compiled for portal vein flow, velocity, and diameter across all intervenção groups. For illustrative purposes, in Group M1, the mean portal vein flow exhibited a reduction from 1100.60 ± 263.77 ml/min pre-intervenção to 981.76 ± 327.75 ml/min post-intervenção. Similarly, portal vein velocity demonstrated a consistent decrease across all groups (e.g., Group M1: 26.48 ± 6.60 cm/s pre-intervenção vs. 20.77 ± 4.92 cm/s post-intervenção). Conversely, portal vein diameter exhibited relative stability. The congestion index values for all experimental groups were found to be consistent with established normal physiological reference ranges (approximately 0.70 ± 0.029 cm/s). Moreover, a discernible trend towards reduced mean systemic arterial pressure was noted across all groups post-intervenção. Nevertheless, no statistically significant alterations from baseline were detected for any of the quantitatively assessed hemodynamic parameters This pilot investigation confirms the methodological feasibility of assessing immediate hemodynamic responses to osteopathic visceral techniques with Doppler ultrasonography. Though no statistically significant changes were observed from baseline, consistent trends showed reductions in portal vein flow, velocity, and volume, alongside decreased systemic arterial pressure post-intervenção. These observed patterns strongly suggest a genuine physiological and acute systemic effect. The statistical insignificance, likely due to sample size, underscores the crucial need for robust inquiry. Therefore, these preliminary yet promising findings necessitate larger, adequately powered randomized controlled trials. Such studies are vital to confirm effects, elucidate mechanisms, and explore long-term clinical implications for patients with hepatic or systemic hemodynamic dysfunctions. Rigorous research is fundamental for validating therapeutic efficacy and integrating osteopathic visceral manipulation into baseado em evidence clinical practice, ultimately enhancing patient care and informing clinical guidelines globally.",

PICS were introduced in the official organizational chart of the Municipality of Rio de Janeiro in 1992, through the creation of the Alternative Medicine Department. Despite this long journey, their implementation in Primary Health Care remains a challenging. This study aimed to analyze the potential and challenges regarding the institutionalization of PICS within the Primary Health Care in the city of Rio de Janeiro from the perspective of managers. This is a cross-sectional, descriptive research with a qualitativo approach is based on secondary sources from the Municipal Health Department of Rio de Janeiro database and interviews with managers directly involved in primary healthcare. This local research ethics committees approved this study by CAAE number 58155522.2.3001.5279. The data analysis revealed the presence of at least one integrative and complementary practice in 64% of primary healthcare units, as well as professionals' interest in training in these practices. Semi-structured interviews were conducted that addressed four main dimensions: service structuring, action planning, professional training, and the credibility of PICS. The interviews were transcribed and analyzed using Bardin's method. Weaknesses were identified in the areas of funding, monitoring, training, evidence, and segurança. PICS were found to be a powerful force in healthcare, offering differentiated and complementary approaches to the primary healthcare team's work process. Institutionalizing Complementary and Integrative Practices in Health within the Primary Health Care system of the Municipality of Rio de Janeiro requires overcoming challenges and strengthening ongoing educational efforts.",

    "abstract": "Different Complementary Therapies encompass techniques capable of supporting the healing of humans, animals, and plants. The Flower Essence Therapy developed by Edward Bach was initially intended for humans, intended to support the tratamento of emotional issues. The companionship between humans and their pets brings various benefits, such as emotional support, protection, and participation in therapies. However, the increasing humanization of pets has been associated with undesired behaviors in animals and emotional imbalances in their guardians. This study aimed at evaluating an online experiential model for guardians seeking to improve their relationship with their pets through self-awareness supported by Flower Essence Therapy. This is a preliminary exploratory study with a qualitativo approach, based on online experiences, a digital questionnaire, and recorded interviews. It was carried out with pet owner and their pets in Paraíba and São Paulo, Brazil, between June and July 2024, and was previously approved by the Research Ethics Committees for humans (CAAE: 72894523.9.0000.5188) and animals (CEUA n° 3262100823). Participants were recruited through direct invitations or the snowball sampling method, totaling 14 participants. The interviews were analyzed through thematic categories, which were organized empirically based on the statements of the pet owners, guided by Minayo's qualitativo research framework. Two synchronous online experiential sessions were held, with participant reports recorded for later analysis. Fourteen female guardians over 18 years old participated, along with 14 pets  five cats and nine dogs, aged between 1 and 18 years, nine of which had been rescued from distressing situations. The participants and their animals used two different formulations from the Sistema Florais da Amazônia (Amazonian Flower Essences system). The guardians received the Purificação formula (Purification), taken orally at a dosage of four drops four times a day, starting 15 days before the first session, and the Renascimento formula (Rebirth), with the same dosage, starting the day after the first session. The animals received specific formulations developed by the veterinary researcher, named Animal Identity Formula for Dogs and Animal Identity Formula for Cats. Thematic analysis of the reports revealed four core meaning categories related to both guardians and animals: animal behavior, household well-being and harmony, emotional symptoms of the guardians, and physical symptoms in the animals. The guardians expressed that the experience was meaningful, providing greater self-awareness, a better understanding of the household environment, and a deeper connection with their pets. Regarding the animals, guardians reported significant behavioral improvements, such as increased calmness, serenity, playfulness, and happiness. Physical improvements were also observed, including reductions in diarrhea and appetite changes. Another notable resultado was improved integration of the animal within the household social dynamics. It is concluded that the floral formulations used had a positive impact on both the guardians and their pets. Despite the limited number of participants, these findings are promising for future validation of the Animal Identity formulas for dogs and cats.",

    "abstract": "An adults health literacy (HL) guides all aspects of their health so will influence their health practitioners, tratamento preferences, and engagement with online resources, in attempts to optimise their health and wellbeing. With this in mind, there is a need to better understand the health literacy of adults using TCIM, and this is best achieved through the use of validated TCIM health literacy instruments. This study aims to identify the use and features of validated instruments for mearing the health literacy of the general adult population of TCIM users. A revisão sistemática registered with PROSPERO; conducted across seven databases to include studies that sample adults (aged 18 years and over) from the public who use TCIM and report the use of a validated instrument which measures adult health literacy (including digital health literacy). Health Literacy instruments were reported using four domains i) Accessing or obtaining information, ii) Understanding information, iii) Processing/appraising information, and iv) Applying/employing information. Guidelines from the COSMIN Risk of Bias checklist were adhered to for data extraction and instrument quality was assessed using the COSMIN checklist. A total of 21 instruments were identified from 29 papers. Ten instruments were specific or partially specific to TCIM and related to TCIM disclosure, TCIM segurança and efficacy, TCIM media influence, and more specifically to areas such as nutritional supplements, Traditional Chinese Medicine, and Acupuncture. Most HL instruments in this review assessed two or more HL domains (n=14), including five instruments that assessed all four HL domains. Approximately one quarter of all instruments received an overall assessment rating of `very good quality (n=5), with majority of instruments rating as either doubtful (n=9) or inadequate (n=7) quality Investigating HL and specific HL instruments in relation to adult TCIM use and users will clearly benefit the TCIM research field and the wider health research community. Future research must focus efforts to develop validated TCIM-specific HL instruments which will ensure TCIM use and users are not excluded from HL scholarship and research advances.",

    "abstract": "Norovirus infections and acute enteric infectious diseases, characterized by vomiting and diarrhea, disproportionately affect pediatric and immunocompromised populations. While traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is extensively employed as a complementary terapia, current evidence remains fragmented due to methodological heterogeneity. This scoping review systematically analyzes clinical evidence on TCM intervençãos to inform baseado em evidence practice. Following the Arksey and OMalley's framework, we searched CNKI, Wanfang Data, SinoMED, VIP, PubMed, and Embase up to January 2025. Inclusion criteria: (1) patients with norovirus infection or acute enteric symptoms; (2) TCM intervençãos; (3) Control groups (if present): Participants receiving any clinical intervenção; (4) all resultados; (5) study designs restricted to randomized/non-randomized controlled trialsRCTs/nRCTs), cohort studies, case-control studies, prospective case series, and cross-sectional studies. Descriptive statistics were applied to categorize the included studies by design, intervençãos, duration, and resultados. A total of 919 studies were analyzed, including 913 published in Chinese and 6 in English. Of these, 915 were conducted in China, and 4 international studies (Iran: 2, 0.22%; India: 1, 0.11%; Russia: 1, 0.11%). RCTs constituted 91.73% (843 studies), with nRCTs (42, 4.57%), prospective case series (23, 2.50%), case-control (6, 0.65%), cohort (4, 0.44%), and cross-sectional studies (1, 0.11%) comprising the remainder. The 919 studies comprised two therapeutic approaches: 116 TCM-monoterapia studies and 803 integrative TCM-WM studies, with intervençãos including Chinese herbal formulas (490, 53.32%), Chinese patent medicines (297, 32.32%), acupuntura/tuina (177, 19.26%), acupoint plaster terapia (146, 15.89%), retention enema (48, 5.22%), single Chinese herb (21, 2.29%), and TCM health education (2, 0.22%), with the 4 non-Chinese studies exclusively focused on single Chinese herb intervençãos. Among studies reporting disease course, 82.76% sought tratamento within 7 days post-onset (0-3d: 302, 49.59%; 4-7d: 202, 33.17%) with 95.71% tratamento duration 7 days. Outcome metrics comprised: (1) Composite efficacy endpoints (844 studies, 91.84%), including cure (437, 51.78%), marked improvement (440, 52.13%), improvement (738, 87.44%), no response (787, 93.25%), total effective rate (770, 91.23%), and self-resolution (1, 0.12%), with only 278 studies defining different efficacy resultados, involving 52 types of definition criteria; (2) Symptom indicators (427 studies,46.46%), predominantly diarrhea (296, 69.32%), fever (280, 65.57%), vomiting (168, 39.34%); (3) Laboratory assessments (170 studies, 18.50%); featuring pathogen detection (80, 47.06%), immune markers (29, 17.06%); (4) additional endpoints (50 studies, 5.44%), e.g., hospitalization duration (27, 54.00%), disease course (20, 40.00%). This scoping review synthesizes evidence from 919 studies on TCM intervençãos for norovirus/acute enteric infections. The literature is predominantly composed by Chinese-language RCTs relying on heterogeneous, non-standardized composite efficacy endpoints as primary resultados. This methodological limitation severely compromises evidence comparability and synthesis, fundamentally limiting evidence comparability and synthesis. TCM is primarily administered adjunctively with Western medicine, initiated early with short tratamento durations. Chinese herbal formulas and patent medicines represent the core intervençãos, whereas objective laboratory assessments and patient-centered resultados remain significantly underrepresented. Notably, despite limited research on single-herb intervençãos, all 4 international studies focused exclusively on this approach with balanced resultado metrics, suggesting its potential for global dissemination. Future research must prioritize core resultado sets with standardized metrics to establish clinically translatable evidence.",

    "abstract": "Sarcopenia is a syndrome characterized by the progressive loss of muscle mass and strength, common in the elderly and worsened by factors such as physical inactivity and poor nutrition. According to Ayurvedic medicine, this condition is associated with an imbalance of the doshas, especially Vata, and a deficiency of the muscle tissue (Mamsa Dhatu). Aging, reduced metabolism (Agni), and obstruction of the body's channels (Srotas) aggravate the condition. This review aimed to explore the therapeutic approaches of Ayurvedic medicine applied to the prevenção and management of sarcopenia. This study adopts a narrative literature review approach, aiming to gather and discuss the main concepts and evidence related to the use of Ayurvedic medicine in the prevenção and tratamento of sarcopenia, particularly in elderly populations. Data collection was carried out through the selection of scientific articles, and acadêmico publications, published between 2010 and 2025. Sources were obtained from databases such as PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, ResearchGate, Web of Science and journals specializing in Ayurveda and geriatrics. The main descriptors used included: Sarcopenia, Ayurveda, Panchakarma, Rasayana, Ashwagandha, Curcumin, Dinacharya, and Ayurvedic herbal terapia. The inclusion criteria comprised studies and reviews addressing: i. The pathophysiology of sarcopenia from an Ayurvedic perspective; ii. Ayurvedic intervençãos with therapeutic potential for maintaining or restoring muscle strength and mass; iii. Clinical trials, in vitro or in vivo studies on the effects of Rasayana herbs and traditional Ayurvedic compounds; iv. Preventive Ayurvedic approaches such as dinacharya, diet, and yoga/pranayama practices targeted at the elderly. Therefore, the methodological goal of this work is to integrate the millennia-old Ayurvedic tradition with modern scientific advances, providing a critical and informative foundation for future research and clinical applications focused on healthy aging and sarcopenia prevenção. The study identified that Ayurvedic medicine offers effective approaches for managing sarcopenia, highlighting therapies such as Rasayana, Panchakarma, Yoga, and Pranayama. Herbal remedies like Ashwagandha, Amalaki, Shatavari, and Curcuma have shown potential in improving muscle strength, reducing inflammation, and slowing muscle degeneration. Daily Ayurvedic practices (Dinacharya) and a balanced diet also proved relevant in the prevenção and control of sarcopenia. Despite the limited number of ensaio clínicos in humans, the results suggest that integrating these strategies may promote healthy aging and help preserve muscle functionality in the elderly. The review indicates that Ayurvedic practices, including Rasayana, Panchakarma, fitoterapia, and Dinacharya, show potential in preserving muscle mass and strength in the elderly. Although clinical evidence is still limited, the findings suggest that Ayurveda may complement conventional approaches in managing sarcopenia and promoting healthy aging.",

    "abstract": "Microcephaly is a condition that affects intrauterine development and may manifest after birth, leading to neuromotor impairments such as posture, gait, speech, hearing, and cognitive deficits, including intellectual disability. Since 2017, osteopathy has been integrated into the Brazilian Unified Health System (SUS) as a complementary tratamento. In pediatrics, evidence suggests its benefits for breastfeeding, reduction of intestinal colic, shorter hospitalization time in intensive care units, and decreased hospital costs. The osteopathic approach includes the assessment of somatic dysfunctions (SD), previously described in healthy newborns. The objective was to investigate which SD and neuromusculoskeletal alterations are present in children under five years old with microcephaly or susceptibility to the condition during osteopathic manipulative tratamento (OMT). This is a quasi-experimental, pragmatic clinical study conducted between September 2022 and October 2023 at a public pediatric outpatient clinic at the Faculty of Medicine of Jundiaí (FMJ), São Paulo, Brazil. Children of both sexes who had never received OMT were included. The convenience sample was evaluated using the NE-O model, and records were based on the adapted Outpatient Osteopathic SOAP Note Form Series (SOAP). The assessment involved anamnesis, inspection, osteopathic palpatory evaluation, measurement of head circumference (HC), and craniometry using the MIMOS Br cranial caliper. Additionally, possible associations between SD and neuromusculoskeletal alterations with gestational age, type of delivery, head circumference, and birth weight were investigated. The study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee, approval no. 2.222.398, and registered in the Brazilian Registry of Clinical Trials (ReBEC) under number RBR-3zjz5qd A total of 20 children were analyzed, with a mean gestational age of 37.5 weeks. Twelve children were between 24 and 36 months old, and 11 were female. Microcephaly was identified in nine children (45%), whose HC at birth was less than 31.0 cm, with eight presenting a larger anteroposterior cranial diameter. The most prevalent SD were found in the skull (85%), lower limbs (55%), and cervical region (45%). In the microcephaly group, a higher frequency of SD was observed in the thoracic region between T5-T9 (40%) compared to children without the condition. No statistically significant associations were found between SD and perinatal factors such as type of delivery or gestational age Osteopathic assessment identified somatic dysfunctions in children with microcephaly, particularly in the craniocervical and mid-thoracic regions. The absence of statistically significant associations with perinatal factors suggests the multifactorial complexity of the condition, emphasizing the need for individualized approaches in monitoring these patients. Osteopathy demonstrates potential as a complementary resource for the evaluation and intervenção of children with neuromusculoskeletal alterations associated with microcephaly or susceptibility to the condition. Future studies with larger samples, case-control designs, and longitudinal follow-up are necessary to validate these findings and investigate the impact of osteopathy on child development.",

    "abstract": "The following is a case study of the shifting dynamic of traditional healing, mentorship and training in Ontario, Canada. Indigenous healing remains an option for Indigenous Peoples and is currently available in select medical clinics and with private practitioners; however, there are limited numbers of healers. A recent Ontario-based grassroots Indigenous policy statement articulates the time-immemorial practice of Indigenous healing and calls for mentorship and training to fill this gap. The Constitution Act of Canada advances language that recognizes and affirms existing Indigenous rights. This paper aims to call to action the right to Indigenous healing and thereby mobilize systems-level change in Indigenous healing, mentorship and training. The method involves a review of ethnohistorical literature on historical practices related to the mentorship and training of Indigenous healers, both before and after the onset of settler colonialism in Ontario, Canada. This review contrasts the colonial policy and its legacy to eliminate Indigenous healing knowledge through the Indian Act of Canada, Residential Schools, and systemic racism, which displaced the central role of healing in Indigenous communities. Social movements in the 1970s and 1980s gradually voiced Indigenous perspectives on healing, and in the 1990s and 2000s, traditional healing options began to emerge in clinical and addiction tratamento centres. In the 2020s, demand for traditional healers remains high, and there are accounts of healing programs struggling to find healers. Results from document analysis reveal various forms of traditional healing that rely on a system of mentorship based on training with experienced healers. The occurrence of a systematic healing system before colonization is consistent with the Constitutional qualifying discourse for the Indigenous practice of healing as a right. Contemporary Indigenous voices, particularly in the Indigenous policy statement, emphasize the interconnectedness of healing as an Indigenous right and the pressing need for support and mentorship in Indigenous healing. Indeed, Indigenous Peoples are calling for a systems-level pluralistic medical model inclusive of traditional healing options for Indigenous patients. New policy frameworks are a requirement to accommodate traditional healing in alignment with the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and Canadas Truth and Reconciliation Commissions Calls to Action. An resultado of this presentation is a direct call to participants in the Indigenous community and allies to collaborate on supporting systems-level changes in decolonizing Indigenous nation-settler-state relations by recognizing the right to autonomous Indigenous healing, mentorship, and training systems.",

This retrospective study included 635 hospitalized patients with VE in seven medical centers in China between January 2015 and December 2021. The risk factors of poor prognosis of patients were compared with Xiyanping users (n=480) and non-Xiyanping users (n=155). And the propensity matching score (PSM) was used to eliminate the influence of confounding factors. The effects of Xiyanping users on the symptoms, hospitalization costs, complications and sequelae of hospitalized patients were evaluated simultaneously. Multivariate Logistic regression analysis showed that the use of Xiyanping users was a protective factor for poor prognosis with VE (odds ratio [OR]:0.251, 95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 0.113-0.559, p < 0.001). Treatment reduced fever duration, headache persistence, and hospitalization costs. Lower incidences of respiratory infections, myocardial injury, and sequelae were observed (all p < 0.05).

    "abstract": "Microcephaly is a congenital anomaly that affects fetal and postnatal neuromotor development. The main complications include posture, balance, and gait disorders, as well as speech and hearing difficulties, in addition to intellectual disability. Currently, there are no specific tratamentos, with early stimulation being the recommended approach. Osteopathy, through Osteopathic Manipulative Treatment (OMT), aims to correct somatic dysfunctions (SD), stimulate the body's self-regulation, and promote effects at multiple levels. Recognized by the World Health Organization (WHO) as part of Traditional and Complementary Medicine (T&CM), osteopathy is also integrated into the Brazilian Unified Health System (SUS). Evidence suggests that osteopathy, as a complementary terapia in pediatric care, may reduce hospitalization time and healthcare costs, as well as assist in improving intestinal colic and neurological disorders. However, there is still no substantial evidence regarding the use of osteopathy in the tratamento of microcephaly and its consequences in pediatric outpatient settings. The objective of this study was to assess the effects of OMT on SD and neuromusculoskeletal alterations in children under five years old with microcephaly or susceptibility to the condition. This is a quasi-experimental, pragmatic ensaio clínico conducted between September 2022 and October 2023 in a public pediatric outpatient clinic in Jundiaí, São Paulo, Brazil. The study involved osteopathic intervençãos in children of both sexes with microcephaly or susceptibility to the condition. It was approved by the Research Ethics Committee (CEP) of the Faculty of Medicine of Jundiaí (FMJ-SP) (no. 2.222.398) and registered in the Brazilian Registry of Clinical Trials (ReBEC) (no. RBR-3zjz5qd). Cranial somatic dysfunctions (SD) were identified in 17 children (85%), who also had lower weight and head circumference (HC) values in the three assessments, with no statistically significant differences. The number of SDs decreased from the 4th TMO (children 2, 3, 4, 7-11, 15, 16, 17, 19, 20). The variation in the number of SDs found and the children's development do not show a clear association with the children's ages, intervals between TMO, and tratamento periods. However, each child can be considered individually as their control, reinforcing the individual approach of TMO. Changes in previously identified SD were observed, including changes in mobility, asymmetries, and cranial functions, as well as adjustments in the upper and middle thoracic spine and head circumference (HC) in 16 children. A qualitativo improvement in craniofacial and postural development was observed, with no efeitos adversos reported. The children in this study received TMO at different intervals and in different amounts, ranging from 1 TMO (4 children) to 14 TMO (1). Four children received 3 TMO, 3 children received 4 TMO, and 6 children received 5 and 6 TMO, respectively. The findings indicate that osteopathy shows potential as a complementary approach in pediatric care for children with microcephaly or susceptibility to the condition. However, to generate more robust evidence regarding the beneficial effects of OMT in this population, clinical studies with larger samples, a qualitativo-quantitative approach, controlled designs, and longitudinal follow-up are necessary.",

    "abstract": "Women's knowledge about plants dates back to ancient civilizations. This traditional knowledge is rooted in the practice and skill of recognizing, cultivating, and using plants for various purposessuch as medicinal, nutritional, and ornamental applicationsparticularly for family care and personal health, including the tratamento of climacteric symptoms. The climacteric refers to the transitional period from the reproductive to the non-reproductive phase and may represent up to one-third of a woman's life. Various common symptoms experienced during this period can significantly affect women's qualidade de vida. Many women choose to use medicinal plants instead of hormone terapia, mainly due to the efeitos adversos associated with hormonal tratamentos. Ouro Preto (Minas Gerais, Brazil), a city recognized as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization), also holds valuable cultural heritage, including the traditional use of medicinal plants. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate local knowledge regarding medicinal plants used for the tratamento of climacteric symptoms. The study was submitted to and approved by the Research Ethics Committee under number CAAE 56312916.8.0000.5150. This study involved 81 climacteric women residing in Ouro Preto, Minas Gerais, who were previously enrolled in a community outreach project by the Federal University of Ouro Preto (UFOP) focused on women's health. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews and guided tours. The plant species mentioned were collected by the participants and subsequently identified, herborized, and deposited in the OUPR Herbarium at UFOP. The reported uses were investigated through literature searches in the following databases: SciELO, PubMed, Google Scholar, and Scopus, using keywords that included the scientific names and their synonyms, along with the term \"medicinal\" in Portuguese, English, and Spanish. A total of 39 species, belonging to 25 families, were reported by the participating women as having some beneficial effect on alleviating climacteric symptoms. Among the most frequently cited species, mulberry (Morus nigra L.) and black cohosh (Actaea racemosa L.) stand out due to existing evidence supporting their efetividade in reducing \"hot flashes,\" a common and distressing symptom experienced by climacteric women. Among the 39 cited species, 53% were associated with some type of toxicity, contraindications, or efeitos adversos; 37% showed no evidence of toxicity; and for 10%, no toxicity-related studies were found. The lack of conclusive studies on some of the species mentioned, such as sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum) and nasturtium (Tropaeolum majus), highlights the need for future pharmacological research. The existence of efeitos adversos and toxicity underscores the need for pharmaceutical guidance and medical supervision in the use of medicinal plants, in order to ensure the efficacy and safe application of this important resource.The results of this work contribute to the appreciation and conservation of knowledge about the use of plants, to improving the qualidade de vida of women and strengthening the relationship between the university and the community.

    "abstract": "Nutrition plays a key role in Germanys saúde pública strategies, yet up-to-date data on dietary attitudes and behaviors remains limited. This study aimed to examine how sociodemographic factors influence nutritional attitudes and behaviors among German-speaking adults. In 2022, a nationally representative online cross-sectional survey was conducted with 4,065 German-speaking adults aged 18 to 75 years using a Computer Assisted Web Interview (CAWI) format. The questionnaire covered personal eating habits, the perceived importance of nutrition, motivations behind food choices, and openness to dietary changes. Data analysis involved descriptive statistics, CHAID decision tree analysis to identify key predictors, and nonparametric inferential methods for inductive evaluation. Overall, 62.3% of participants regarded healthy nutrition as important. This positive attitude was particularly strong among women, those with higher education, and participants younger than 26 or older than 70 years. Education emerged as the most significant predictor of a positive attitude toward healthy eating, followed by gender and income, as shown by the CHAID analysis. Participants who valued healthy nutrition reported a higher health-related qualidade de vida (HRQoL), with an average EQ-Index of 0.862, compared to 0.835 in those with neutral or negative attitudes. Regarding dietary habits, 10.5% of respondents identified as non-meat eaters, 28.6% as flexitarians, and 54.1% as omnivores. Plant-based diets were notably more prevalent among women. When asked about their main reasons for food choices, 77.2% cited taste as the leading factor. Approximately 18% indicated that they predominantly or exclusively purchased organic foods. Importantly, around one-third of participants expressed willingness to adopt a more plant-based diet if such a change was recommended by physicians or scientists. This suggests a considerable openness to dietary shifts under expert guidance. The findings underscore the strong influence of sociodemographic factors, particularly education, gender, and income, on attitudes toward nutrition in Germany. The positive association between healthy nutrition attitudes and qualidade de vida highlights the benefits of promoting nutrition awareness. Furthermore, the readiness of many individuals to follow expert dietary advice presents a promising opportunity for saúde pública initiatives aimed at fostering healthier and more sustainable eating patterns. Tailored strategies that consider these demographic influences can enhance the efetividade of nutrition-related promoção da saúde in Germany.",

Integrating TCM preventive programs into the diagnosis and tratamento, to explore ways and methods for TCM to prevent diseases, and provided important references for evidence schemes, diagnosis and tratamento standards, and quality evaluation for the prevenção of childhood influenza. Based on knowledge graph algorithm, text mining was conducted on literature text data to explore the factors related to the effective of traditional Chinese medicine in treating children. Based on machine learning algorithms, decision tree and random forest models were used to statistically analyze the relevant factors of real world data of childhood influenza. The factors affecting the clinical characteristics of traditional Chinese medicine tratamento for childhood influenza were analyzed, and the relative importance of factors related to the effective of traditional Chinese medicine tratamento for childhood influenza was explored. Real case data were obtained from confirmed pediatric cases and influenza-like cases that met the criteria between October 1, 2021 and September 30, 2022 in five hospitals in Beijing. Based on machine learning algorithms, the relevant factors and relative importance affecting the efficacy of traditional Chinese medicine in treating children with influenza were analyzed. The data was confirmed pediatric cases from five hospitals in Beijing 2022. The results showed that the male to female ratio was 2:3; Children under 5 years old account for 75%; There was a significant statistical difference between the traditional Chinese medicine group and the control group. The efficacy related factors include age, height and weight, vaccination history, number of days with symptoms, frequency of respiratory diseases, average daily sleep time, timely medication, allergy history, one-child policy, medical history, acadêmico burden, premature birth, and an average of 1 hour or more of high-intensity exercise per day. Obtain the relative importance of factors through SHAP analysis.The efficacy of Chinese medicine in treating children's influenza was remarkable. The tratamento not only reduces fever quickly and has a higher rate of influenza virus conversion, but also effectively shorten the course of the disease, which was the clinical therapeutic effect remarkable.

    "abstract": "The humanization of healthcare has increasingly become a central concern in saúde pública policies, particularly in Brazil, where it is institutionalized through the National Policy for the Humanization of Health Care and Management (PNH  Política Nacional de Humanização), launched by the Ministry of Health in 2002. This policy emphasizes the importance of placing individuals at the center of healthcare practices, fostering respect for subjectivity, autonomy, and the social and cultural contexts of patients. Despite this policy orientation, many health services still struggle to implement truly humanized care. One of the key challenges lies in the dominance of biomedical rationality, which often leads to a reductionist view of illness and care. In this context, traditional medicines  with their holistic, integrative, and patient-centered approaches  emerge as potential allies in overcoming the limitations of biomedicine and advancing the process of humanizing healthcare. This is a theoretical and analytical study based on a critical review of literature and official documents related to the National Policy for the Humanization of Health Care and Management (Brazil, 2002), as well as acadêmico works discussing the philosophical underpinnings of biomedicine and traditional medical systems. Dehumanized care manifests in various ways within health services, especially through the difficulty that health professionals face in addressing aspects of the illness process that are meaningful to patients. When professionals reduce their focus to diagnosis or procedures alone, they neglect essential biopsychosocial dimensions. This reduction has several consequences: it impairs clinical decision-making by omitting relevant subjective information; weakens the therapeutic relationship; diminishes the patient's receptiveness to tratamento proposals; and reinforces heteronomy instead of supporting patient autonomy. These features suggest that the presence of other medical rationalities  whether through the integration of traditional practitioners into health services or through hybrid professional training  can significantly contribute to the humanization of care. Specifically, such integration may: Encourage professionals to accept alternative perspectives and care models, including those brought by patients themselves. Broaden the scope of listening, valuing information that escapes the biomedical framework. Strengthen the therapeutic relationship by promoting trust and mutual understanding. Promote a more comprehensive and integrated approach to healthcare. In summary, traditional medicines, by largely rejecting the mechanistic and reductionist philosophies of biomedicine, offer valuable contributions to the process of humanizing healthcare. Their holistic, contextualized, and patient-centered approaches align with the goals of the National Policy for the Humanization of Health Care and Management, offering concrete strategies for improving the quality of interactions between professionals and patients.",

    "abstract": "Mindfulness-Oriented Recovery Enhancement (MORE) is a atenção plena-based intervenção designed for dor crônica management. Previously, we evaluated MORE for lumbosacral radicular pain (LRP) and found that MORE reduced daily pain intensity but did not reduce disability (e.g., activities of daily living). Therefore, the current study aimed to develop a multicomponent intervenção which integrated MORE with physical activity for patients with LRP: Move-MORE. We employed a multi-phase, human-centered design approach to intervenção development incorporating qualitativo data from patients with LRP and pain-focused clinicians. Through stakeholder discussions with MORE facilitators, an initial draft of the Move-MORE manual was developed. To adapt the manual for patients with LRP, we conducted clinician interviews to gather insights on LRP tratamento across healthcare disciplines, and patient focus groups to evaluate the pilot structure and content. Discussions with patient partners informed the development of the focus group guide. All interviews and focus groups were recorded and transcribed for rapid qualitativo analysis. Using the Ecological Validity Model, we identified specific aspects of the Move-MORE program requiring modifications. Reasons for intervenção modifications were assigned using the Person-Based Approach and were prioritized using MoSCoW criteria (Must have, Should have, Could have, Would like). We then collected patient-reported resultados (PROs) for kinesiophobia (Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia-11), disability (Oswestry Disability Index), and illness representations (Illness Perceptions Questionnaire-Revised [IPQ-R]). Results: 9 clinician interviews were completed (2-physical therapists, 2-chiropractors, 2-pain psychologists, 1-pain management health coach, 1-acupuncturist, 1-physiatry physicians assistant); mean age of 47.9±15 years, 11% female, 22% non-white, 15.3±12.7 years in practice. 15 patients with LRP participated in four focus groups; mean age 45.6±8.8, 93% female, 27% non-white, 47% reported income <$25,000/year, and 67% reported a previous disability insurance claim for their pain. Key themes developed from the qualitativo analysis included strategies for managing pain flares using mental and physical techniques, fostering individualized motivation for behavior change, and approaches to promote physical activity among dor crônica patients. Patient participants shared meaningful insights, including: It was interesting that when we focused on an area I noticed the tension, and just noticing itthe act of noticingwas the release that it needed. Participants commonly reported recognizing that atenção plena may bring up discomfort or memories of trauma, and finding value in normalizing these experiences rather than pathologizing them. On average, the sample had moderate kinesiophobia (30.3±4.4) and severe disability (23.5±7.2). On the IPQ-R subscales, the sample reported perceiving their condition as long-term, significantly impacting their daily life, occurring in a cyclical manner with worsening symptoms and remission, and conferring an emotional burden. Discussion: Findings from interviews, focus groups, and PROs guided refinements to the Move-MORE intervenção. Stakeholders emphasized the value of combining atenção plena and movement to address pain and kinesiophobia. Moderate-to-severe kinesiophobia and disability further support a multicomponent approach. Developing multicomponent pain management intervençãos benefits from the involvement of multiple stakeholders and iterative feedback. This mixed-methods study led to a patient-informed intervenção for LRP. Move-MORE will now be evaluated in a single-arm pilot trial to assess feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy.",

    "abstract": "Climacteric is a stage of female aging characterized by a decline in sex hormone levels, which can lead to distressing symptoms such as hot flashes, vaginal dryness, and mood swings. This transitional period also increases the risk of ansiedade and depressão, negatively affecting women's qualidade de vida. Although menopausal hormone terapia (MHT) is commonly recommended to manage these symptoms, its use is often limited by contraindications and potential efeitos adversos. As a result, aromaterapia has gained attention as a complementary and integrative approach for symptom relief and qualidade de vida improvement. This pilot study aimed to evaluate the effects of inhaling Citrus sinensis essential oil on ansiedade, depressão, and overall qualidade de vida in climacteric women. Thirty-three women aged between 40 and 65 years who scored 10 on the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) and/or 11 on the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) were randomly assigned to one of two groups: aromaterapia (AG) (n=16) or control (CG) (n=17). The AG received inhalation tratamento for 10 minutes, adding five drops of Citrus sinensis essential oil to a diffuser for eight weekly sessions, The CG underwent the same procedure using sweet almond vegetable oil. Participants in both groups were also provided with a bottle of their respective oil for daily home use and instructed to place five drops on a piece of paper to be left beside their pillow overnight. Validated questionnaires were used to assess climacteric symptoms (Menopause Rating Scale  MRS), ansiedade (BAI), depressão (BDI), and qualidade de vida (Utian Quality of Life Scale  UTIAN). Anthropometric and blood pressure measurements were also recorded. All assessments were conducted at baseline (T0) and after eight weeks of tratamento (T8). Data were analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics, version 25.0. Thirty-three climacteric women completed the 8-week follow-up and were included in the analysis (16 in the AG and 17 in the CG). While the AG exhibited more pronounced effects, both groups showed a significant reduction (p < 0.05) in ansiedade (12 points in both groups), depressão (14.5 points in the AG and 12.8 in the CG), and climacteric symptom scores (13.4 points in the AG and 9.7 in the CG). However, only the aromaterapia group demonstrated a significant improvement in qualidade de vida, as measured by the UTIAN questionnaire (from 71.38±12.16 to 80.75±10.75; p = 0.014). No significant changes in anthropometric and blood pressure measurements were observed in either group. The improvements observed in the CG may be attributed to the relaxing environment of the sessions, a possible placebo effect, and the shared aromaterapia application method. The findings suggest that Citrus sinensis essential oil inhalation may improve qualidade de vida in climacteric women. Further studies with larger sample sizes are needed to confirm these results and better understand the therapeutic potential of this intervenção. Acknowledgements: UFOP and FAPEMIG.",

This study aims to address these gaps by exploring Chinese KOA patients' experiences, perceptions, and expectations of manual terapia, emphasizing contextual factors affecting therapeutic resultados and interactions. Participants with KOA were sampled using a simple sampling method from a randomized controlled trial of Tuina tratamento versus manual physical terapia (MPT). The interviews were conducted by two researchers who have extensive experience interviewing KOA patients, and data were gathered through face-to-face, semi-structured interviews to ensure a high level of information power. Three experienced researchers subsequently analyzed employing thematic analysis to assess patient experiences and resultados from both tratamento modalities.The study interviewed a total of 61 participants, thematic saturation was reached when interviewing 42 participants, and seven codes along with 5 sub-themes were utilized to depict potential doctor-patient interactions and influencing factors. This process led to the formation of three themes: Understanding and Impact, Treatment Expectations and Satisfaction, and Treatment Goals and Outcomes, which helped in constructing a model to understand the underlying influences among these themes.

    "abstract": "Auricular acupuntura (AA), based on the concept of auricular somatotopy, is utilized for pain management and tratamento of various health conditions. While its therapeutic applications are well-established, its diagnostic potential remains underexplored. This study aims to investigate the correlation between abdominal organ diseases and corresponding auricular regions in patients with acute abdominal pain, seeking to assess the diagnostic utility of auricular assessment. This prospective, double-blind, observational pilot study was conducted from May 2022 to August 2023. Patients presenting with abdominal pain in the emergency department and meeting specific inclusion criteria were recruited. The auricular examination (AE) involved palpating the concha and helix areas for tender points corresponding to abdominal organs based on Nogier and Bahr's auricular map. Sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios were calculated by correlating identified tender points with diagnoses. Of the 152 screened patients, 104 (68%) received a specific diagnosis related to abdominal organs. For all organs with more than five patients included, the correlating locations identified by Nogier and Bahr were either among the most common or the most sensitive points. High sensitivities were observed for conditions affecting the stomach (93%), small intestine (91%), and liver (71%). Specificities were high for certain organs, such as the ureter (86%) and gallbladder (70%), with relevant positive and negative likelihood ratios for the stomach and appendix. This study demonstrates a possible correlation between abdominal organ diseases and specific auricular regions defined by Nogier and Bahr. Auricular assessment could potentially be added as a non-invasive complementary diagnostic tool. However, further studies with larger cohorts are needed to assess the correlation.",

    "abstract": "Lysimachia nummularia L, popularly known as Creeping Jenny, has been used in Europe externally for treating wounds and ulcers and internally for diarrhea, salivation, gout, rheumatism and joint pain [1]. Rudolf Steiner, the founder of Anthroposophy, proposed a four-ingredient cream for ulcerative tumors that includes L. nummularias aerial parts [2]. Given the interest in the traditional uses of this plant, this study aimed to characterize its morphoanatomy to help with its proper identification and quality control. Leaves, stems and flowers of L. nummularia were collected in Nuglar and in Dornach, Switzerland. A voucher was prepared, kept and then identified in Basel Universitys Herbarium (Switzerland), under the registration number of BASBG-00090509. The material was fixed [3] and stored in 70% ethanol (V/V). For staining, astra blue and basic fuchsin were used [4]. The sections were done freehand. For scanning electron microscopy (SEM), fresh material was fixed, dehydrated in a graded ethanol series [5], dried at the critical point, gold-coated, and examined at the University of Basel. Lysimachia nummularia is an herbaceous perineal, ground covering creeping plant. Leaves are simple, opposite, membranaceous and oval to rounded shaped, with acute to obtuse apex and reentrant base, entire margins, pinnate veins, green colored. Single flowers are found linked to the stem by a simple pedicel to a regular, dialissepal and campanulated chalice, formed by 5 small greenish sepals. The regular rosaceous corolla has five yellow petals with an acute to obtuse apex and smooth texture. There are five stamens, united in adelphy. The anthers are sagittate and valved, tapering more at the apex. The pistil has a globose ovary, a terminal style, and a penicillate stigma. In the leafs surface view, both epidermis present thin and sinuous anticlinal cell walls, covered by a thin cuticle, with anomocytic stomata on both sides. In cross-section, the mesophyll is dorsiventral, composed by one layer of palisade parenchyma and 3-4 layers of spongy parenchyma. The epidermis has rounded cells covered by a thin cuticle, on both sides. Capitate glandular trichomes are present only on abaxial side. Secretory cavities are observed in the mesophyll. The midrib, in cross-section, is concave-convex, with a collateral vascular bundle in open arc with two lateral traces. The stem, in cross-section, is irregularly shaped, and stomata and glandular trichomes also happen in the epidermis; secretory cavities are also present in the cortex; the collateral vascular bundle is surrounded by an endodermis. Starch grains are present in the cortex and the pith. The petals epidermis also present thin and sinuous anticlinal cell walls, covered by a thin cuticle, in surface view. Although, differently from the leaves, the petals have capitate trichomes on both sides of their epidermis. These glandular trichomes are also present in the filament of the anther. This study highlights the importance of morphoanatomical analysis in the quality control of L. nummularia. The morphology and anatomical markers described here are essential for accurate identification and proper pharmaceutical use of the plant.",

    "abstract": "Skin cancer has a high prevalence worldwide. A polyphenol-rich hydroalcoholic extract obtained from the leaves of Thalassia testudinum marine plant has shown effective photoprotection properties against UV radiation, a precursor of skin cancer. Until now, biomass harvesting from its natural habitat may endanger biodiversity and sustainability of this species. However T. testudinum proves invaluable ecosystem services. testudinum cultivated in vitro were compared to the one from natural sources in regard to phytochemical composition and biological activity. Plant material was harvested the Protected Natural Landscape Rincón de Guanabo. Cultivation of T. testudinum explants was tested in marine aquariums with natural substrate. Several trials were conducted under different aeration, lighting, temperature, and nutrient conditions. The appearance of shoots and the macro and micromorphology of the explants were studied. Extracts was prepared from natural or in vitro derived biomass, HPLC phytochemical characterization and biological activity were evaluated in A375 tumoral cell line The explants were viable for up to 12 months with substrate, aeration and 16/8 hours of light/darkness cycles. No differences were observed in the chemical composition from the naturally grown to the in vitro samples regarding Thalassiolin B concentration. The hydroalcoholic extract from the in vitro culture presented the highest percentage of this compound compared to the other extracts evaluated. Thalassiolin B content was higher in the leaves than in the rhizome. Viability of A375 cells in the hydroalcoholic extract from the in vitro-produced biomass resembled the one from natural sources, while IC50 in the rhizome-derived extract was approximately 5-fold higher than the one obtained from the leaves. Reports on T. testudinum culture under artificial controlled conditions have just addressed the biomass production and the micro-macro morphology characterization of the produced explants. The photoprotection and other bioactivities described for this extract has been associated, at least in part, to the phenolic compounds from the plant secondary metabolites. Therefore, the increased content of Thalassiolin B described here for the in vitro-derived biomass in addition to apigenin, luteolin and chrysoeriol, already identified within the extract in a previous study, can be assumed to exert the increased biological effect. The establishment of in vitro aquaponics under controlled artificial conditions and the 12 months survival of explants of the T. testudinum marine angiosperm are possible by using biotechnological alternatives through plant tissue culture for biomass production. Leaves are the most interesting organ for the production of pharmaceutical products due to their high content of Thalassiolin B. In vitro culture might be a sustainable source of plant material for the development of new complementary medicine formulations.",

    "abstract": "Thalassia testudinum, the most abundant marine angiosperm of the Cuban shelf and the Caribbean Sea, is rich in metabolites with promising bioactive properties. One extract obtained from T. testudinum, which provides the basis for obtaining a new product beneficial to human health under criteria of biodiversity conservation and friendliness to the marine-coastal ecosystem. This work shows studies carried out to support the antitumor efficacy of the extract and its segurança margin. Whole dry and ground T. testudinum leaves collected in Guanabo beach were extracted with EtOH-H2O (50:50, v/v) for 24 h at room temperature. The extract was filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure at 40°C to yield crude extract. Its effects on cell viability was measured by MTT assay in normal and tumor cells. Cells were exposure for 48 hours to 10-1000 µg/mL of the extract. By chicken chorioallantoic membrane angiogenesis and wound closure assays and a transcriptome profiling and pathway analysis, the mechanisms involved were evaluated. In vivo effects were tested in CT26 cells, which were inoculated subcutaneously to Balb/c mice. Doses of T. testudinum extract (100 and 200 mg/kg) were orally administered to animals during 14 days. T. testudinum extract significantly prevented basal and bFGF-induced angiogenesis in the chicken chorioallantoic membrane angiogenesis assay. In addition, the extract suppressed bFGF induced migration of endothelial cells in a wound closure assay. Finally, T. testudinum extract tratamento abrogates CT26 colorectal cancer growth and increased overall organism in a syngeneic murine allograft model. Corresponding transcriptome profiling and pathway analysis allowed to identify a first mechanism of action for the anti-tumor effects of the extract. In line with our in vitro/in vivo results, T. testudinum extract tratamento triggers ATF4-P53-NFB specific gene expression and autophagy stress pathways. Transcriptome profiling and systems biology approaches were used to characterize in vitro/in vivo antitumor activities of a extract of T. testudinum growing in the Cuban coasts. In the T. testudinum extract treated SW480 cells, the extract triggers multiple stress pathways (unfolded protein stress, endoplasmic reticulum stress, nitrosative stress, DNA damage), which exceed stress tolerance of colon cancer cells. Studies show that phytochemicals, including constituents of T. testudinum, can efficiently modulate autophagy-dependent cancer cell death. In vivo, additional role for immune signaling pathways (IFN, PD-1, ZAP70) and myeloid leukocyte activation-migration into the tumor microenvironment to promote immunogenic cell death was observed. T. testudinum is a promising source of new drug candidates for diseases controlling with high morbidity and mortality in humans. Meanwhile, from the integrative approach of \"One Health,\" ecological studies show the methods, frequency, and quantities of plant material that can be extracted from the natural environment without affecting the species and its ecosystem.",

    "abstract": "Thalassia testudinum (Hydrocharitaceae) is a marine angiosperm that grows abundantly on the Cuban marine platform. One extract obtained from its leaves is rich in polyphenolic compounds and it has shown bioactive potential as antioxidant, photoprotective and antitumor. This work had the objective of evaluating the anti-inflammatory activity of the T. testudinum extract in inflammation models in vitro and in vivo, as well as in silico modeling of the chemical interactions between the main phytocompounds of the extract with the TNF-TNFR1 complex. Whole dry and ground T. testudinum leaves collected in Guanabo beach were extracted with EtOH-H2O (50:50, v/v) for 24 h at room temperature. The extract was filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure at 40°C to yield crude extract. The effects of T. testudinum extract on the NF-kB transcriptional activity were determined by luciferase reporter gene assays in transfected cell lines, murine fibrosarcoma L929sA (p(IL6B)350 hu.IL6P-luc+) and human monocytes U937-3kB-Luc differentiated into macrophages. The effects of oral administration were evaluated in models of l-carrageenan-induced plantar edema in male OF-1 mice and in cotton pad-induced granuloma in male Balb/c mice. Protein-ligand docking was performed using AutoDock Vina v1.2.0 software, assessing the binding of four ligands (polyphenols identified in the extract) to the active site of TNF- and TNFR1. Cells exposure to T. testudinum extract concentrations between 20 and 200 g/mL significantly inhibited the expression of the NF-kB reporter gene, both in TNF- stimulated L929sA cells and in U937-3B-Luc cells differentiated into macrophages in the presence of PMA and activated with LPS. In addition, T. testudinum extract (5-100 mg/kg, 10 mL/kg) showed dose-dependent anti-inflammatory action in the carrageenan-induced plantar edema model in male OF-1 mice. Furthermore, repeated doses (50-200 mg/kg, 10 mL/kg) of the extract prevented chronic inflammation established in the cotton pad-induced granuloma model in Balb/c mice. From molecular docking analyses, it was determined that the polyphenols identified in the extract selectively interacted with amino acids in the active site of TNF-, showing free energy values of binding in a range of -8.0 to -10.0 Kcal/mol. The anti-inflammatory action observed was due, at least in part, to the inhibition of mediators of the inflammatory response. Phenolic compounds are plant secondary metabolites known for their anti-inflammatory properties, through regulation by NF-kB pathway. Thalassiolin B, apigenin, luteolin and criosoriel were identified in the extract in a previous study. Therefore, it can be assumed that the anti-inflammatory effect by the extract was due to these compounds. Based on these results, products derivate from T. testudinum represent potential natural sources that will be useful for the tratamento of inflammatory-related diseases. These results constituted experimental evidence which supports the extract obtained from T. testudinum as a promising source of natural anti-inflammatory products.",

    "abstract": "Prediabetes management primarily relies on lifestyle changes, with standard pharmacoterapia like metformin (often associated with gastro-intestinal side effects) considered for those who don't achieve desired results. A nutraceutical DLBS 3233 containing Lagerstroemia speciosa and Cinnamomum burmannii has shown glucose-lowering effects in preclinical studies and is popular among patients in our setting, though human efficacy and segurança data are limited. This study aimed to evaluate this nutraceutical in prediabetes management. This retrospective study examined outpatient data from a single secondary hospital, spanning December 2019 to February 2025. It included adult prediabetes patients (aged over 18) who were receiving either metformin or the nutraceutical DLBS3233. Included patients had complete medical records (HbA1c, fasting glucose or oral glucose tolerance test/OGTT, or estimated glomerular filtration rate/eGFR, alanine transaminase/ALT tests). Propensity matching (gender, minimum terapia duration of three months, baseline ALT terapia <30 mg/dL, and eGFR >60mL/minute/1.73m2) balanced the two groups. Resolution of prediabetes (normal HbA1c and/or fasting glucose/OGTT) was the primary resultado. Of the 382 patients screened, 210 were included in the study (105 in each tratamento arm). Metformin group received a daily dose of 1000mg (mean age 39.32 ± 13.1, BMI 26.5 ± 3.2, terapia duration 4.4 ± 1.5 months). Nutraceutical DLBS3233 group received a daily dose of 100mg (mean age 40.05 ± 13.4, BMI 26.7 ± 3.03, terapia duration 4.5 ± 1.4 months). Few patients (<3%) in both groups received simvastatin. The primary resultado was significantly more pronounced in the nutraceutical group [87/105 (82.9%)] compared to metformin [69/105 (65.7%)] (p < 0.05). Logistic regression in the nutraceutical group showed that the terapia duration and hypercholesterolemia tratamento did not affect results, while terapia duration in the metformin group did (p=0.001). Safety analysis showed no serious side effects or significant changes in liver/kidney function in either group. Mild dizziness (6/105) was the most common side effect in the nutraceutical group, while bloating and nausea (85/105) dominated in the metformin group. Preclinical study have shown that DLBS3233, a standardized herbal extract of L. speciosa and C. burmannii, lowers blood glucose by acting as an insulin sensitizer through peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR) modulation. The findings of this study further support its beneficial effects and suggest that DLBS3233 could be an alternative for patients with metformin intolerance. The nutraceutical DLBS3233 containing Lagerstroemia speciosa and Cinnamomum burmannii was well-tolerated and may be beneficial in prediabetes management. Due to the limitation of retrospective design, a randomized controlled study is still needed for confirmation.",

    "abstract": "This study examines the effects of a structured nutritional counseling intervenção for individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). It is a secondary analysis of the BrainFit-Nutrition study, a randomized controlled trial comparing two dietary approachesa Whole Food Plant-Based (WFPB) diet versus a diet following German Nutrition Association (DGE) guidelinesand two types of computer-based cognitive training. While the original trial focused on cognitive performance, this analysis investigates changes in dietary habits over time. Dietary behaviors were assessed at baseline (t0), six months post-intervenção (t6), and at a 12-month follow-up (t12) via food frequency questionnaires. Participants received bi-weekly synchronized online nutritional counseling over six months and were assigned to either the WFPB or DGE dietary group. Short- and long-term dietary changes were analyzed by comparing consumption frequencies of various food categories between groups, using ANCOVAs with baseline values as covariates for exploratory analysis. The study included 261 participants (52.2% female), aged 60 to 86 years, all diagnosed with MCI. Most participants maintained an omnivorous diet, with minor shifts toward pescatarian, ovolacto-vegetarian, and vegan diets. By t12, the WFPB group showed a slight increase in vegan participants (from 2% to 6%) and ovolacto-vegetarians (from 5% to 9%), while the DGE group remained stable in diet classification. Vegetable, fruit, and whole grain consumption stayed stable in both groups, averaging about 14 servings per week for vegetables and 10 for fruits, with no significant differences. Meat consumption significantly decreased in both groups, more so in the WFPB groupfrom 5.8 servings weekly at baseline to 2.4 at t6 and 2.1 at t12. The DGE group saw a smaller decline, from 5.6 to 4.3 at t6 and 3.9 at t12. Fish intake reduced from 3.1 to 1.5 servings per week in the WFPB group by t12, compared to 3.0 to 2.4 in the DGE group. Egg consumption similarly declined, from 4.2 to 2.0 servings in the WFPB group, and 4.1 to 3.5 in the DGE group. Structured nutritional counseling can promote healthier eating habits in individuals with MCI, especially reducing meat, fish, and egg consumption. However, differences between the WFPB and DGE diets were less impactful than the overall effect of participating in a dietary intervenção. Further research is needed to clarify how dietary changes affect cognitive health and to tailor nutritional recommendations for this population.",

    "abstract": "Background: For many individuals with an unfulfilled desire to have children, fertility disorders often represent a major challenge. Beyond conventional tratamentos such as in vitro fertilization (IVF), there is growing interest in whether therapeutic fasting could provide supportive benefits. However, recruitment for intervençãoal studies exploring fasting in the context of fertility tratamento has proved challenging. In this qualitativo study we explored medical professionals´ attitude towards fasting and other complementary approaches in fertility tratamento. Methods: To explore the perspectives of medical professionals, qualitativo data were collected through semi-structured interviews. Transcripts were inductively coded using MAXQDA and thematically analyzed based on Braun and Clarkes approach. Quality was ensured using the COREQ checklist and regular consultation with the research team and experienced qualitativo researchers. Results: Many interviewees perceived therapeutic fasting as an additional burden or even a form of distress for patients undergoing fertility tratamento. Doubts and limited knowledge about fasting among fertility specialists were common, though some acknowledged potential benefits, such as weight loss and improved chances of conception. There was a general openness toward complementary and integrative approaches in fertility care. Interestingly this was not reflected in their recommendations to patients. The interviews also revealed that the professionals generally had their focus on female infertility rather than including both sexes in their thinking. Conclusion: These insights help explain recruitment difficulties in studies addressing integrative approaches, which are still being rarely used in fertility care. To encourage more openness, it may be important to improve knowledge about fasting and other complementary approaches, address existing concerns, and better recognize patients interest in complementary tratamento options.",

    "abstract": "This study analyzes the application status and combination patterns in Chinese patent medicines (CPMs) prescriptions for influenza A/B to inform clinical practice. Prescription records were from Respiratory Department and Pediatric Department of a secondary hospital in Beijing from March 2023 to October 2024. It was a retrospective study approved by the Ethics Committee of Beijing University of Chinese Medicine (2023BZYLL1210). We included all the records confirmed with influenza A and/or B via throat swab. Data on demographics, diagnoses, and prescriptions were processed using Excel 2021, and visualized with OriginPro 2025 and Excel 2021. The results were primarily presented in the form of visual charts and data. A total of 2,568 clinical records showed a male-to-female ratio of 0.93:1. CPMs occupy 77.88% of total prescriptions (83.86% in minors). Prescription peaks occurred between October 2023 and April 2024, with 1,753 cases (68.26%) being diagnosed in influenza A/B. Diagnostic tests were ordered in 517 cases (20.13%), primarily chest CT for adults (367,84.56%) versus chest X-rays for minors (68,81.93%). Western medications prioritized anti-influenza A/B virus medicines (1495,58.22%) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs, 1112, 43.30%). The former was mainly used in capsules for minors and suspensions for adults. The frequently prescribed CPMs were dispelling wind and clearing heat (1,502,58.49%), expelling phlegm and relieving cough (732, 28.50%)clearing heat and removing toxicity (389,15.15%), relieving sore throat for detumescence (348,13.55%), with Yinhua Jiedu Granules (688,26.79%), Jinhua Qinggan Granules (487,18.96%), Xiao'er Chiqiao Qingre Granules (224,8.72%) most prescribed. When two or more CPMs were applied together, the most prescribed combinations were with the function of \"dispelling wind and clearing heat/clearing heat and removing toxicity + expelling phlegm and relieving cough/relieving sore throat for detumescence\". Specifically, \"Dispelling wind and clearing heat + expelling phlegm and relieving cough\" was the most common (422,16.43%). Regarding combinations of CPMs and Western medicines, the most prescribed patterns was \"dispelling wind and clearing heat + NSAIDs and/or anti-influenza A/B virus medicines\" (1617,62.97%). Prescription cost was mostly 400-800 RMB for minors (281,55.98%), while 200-600 RMB for young and middle-aged adults (1274,67.62%). The elderly exhibited a similar cost distribution to adults (109,59.89%), although the proportion of 200-400 RMB was relatively small66,36.26%. CPMs usage remains common across groups in the influenza tratamento, particularly \"dispelling wind and clearing heat \" agent which is frequently combined with \"expelling phlegm and relieving cough\" or \"relieving sore throat for detumescence\" agent. The combinations of CPMs and Western medicines inform us that we must target both the etiology of wind-heat exterior syndrome and viral infection, while addressing the cardinal symptom of fever. The data in this study were obtained from a secondary hospital and are constrained by regional and patient population limitations. Future research should clarify the advantages of CPMs in influenza tratamento, explore the rationality of combinations of CPMs and Western medicines, and emphasize clinical efficacy evaluations in special groups.",

    "abstract": "There is increasing interest in the medicinal use of cannabis sativa and its derivatives, because of their reported effects in chronic diseases with complex management, such as refractory seizures, cancer-related nausea and vomiting, oncological pain, or mental disorders (ansiedade, stress). The cannabis plant participates in multiple physiological processes, usually related to the human cannabinoid system, because of the presence of numerous active compounds, called cannabinoids as (9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD). Instead of its qualification as a psychoactive plant or its relationship with substance use disorder cases, the medicinal use of cannabis was legalized in numerous countries in Latin America, such as Brazil, Uruguay, Chile, Argentina, Colombia, Paraguay, and Peru. In this context, scientific knowledge generation is necessary to distinguish between recreational use (with its widely known efeitos adversos) and medicinal use. However, the preconception about this plant, associated with limited research resources in the region, affects and retards all related initiatives. Consequently, the study aimed to describe the characteristics of production and collaboration in scientific research related to the medicinal use of cannabis in Latin America from 2015 to 2024. A bibliometric analysis, from a systematic search in five databases (Web of Science, Scopus, PubMed, SciELO, and LILACS), including all the scientific production (original articles, brief reports and relato de casos) in the medicinal use of cannabis, developed in all the countries from Latin America and the Caribe. Research about synthetic cannabinoids or with resultados not related to health was excluded. The evaluated bibliometric indicators were: publication year, scientific journals of publication, institutional affiliations, country, research type, and funding. Additionally, a thematic analysis was made through a wordcloud, and a collaboration analysis was developed through clustering and networks (by authors, institutions, and countries). 316 publications from 10 countries were included, with Brazil being the most productive (66,5%), and showing a crescent trend of research output over the 10 years that were studied. The most productive institution was the Universidade de São Paulo (USP), and 15.5% of publications did not refer any funding. The most productive sources were: Cannabis and Cannabinoid Research (5.1%), Neuropharmacology (4.4%), and Behavioural Brain Research (3.2%). 66.9% of studies were qualified as pre-clinical research, and 5.7% were ensaio clínicos. 18 clusters of co-authorship, 27 clusters of institutions, and four clusters of countries' collaboration were founded. Scientific production on the medicinal use of cannabis in Latin American and Caribbean countries between 2015 and 2025 has shown an upward trend, with Brazil and Argentina as the main focus of development. Most studies have been publicly funded, and ensaio clínicos have been underway since 2018. Collaboration between authors and institutions is ongoing; hubs such as the University of São Paulo and the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro offer opportunities for collaboration with external entities and potential funding for research initiatives.",

    "abstract": "The integration of Traditional, Complementary, and Integrative Medicine (TCIM) into mainstream healthcare is a global priority aimed at promoting culturally responsive, people-centered care and achieving universal health coverage. For integration to be effective, it is essential to understand the underlying factors that influence individuals to seek and sustain TCIM use. This review aimed to identify the most influential determinant of TCIM utilization and to explore its implications for system-level integration. A systematic umbrella review was conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. Searches were performed in PubMed, Embase, and reference lists to identify peer-reviewed revisão sistemáticas published between January 2005 and March 2024 in English or Arabic. Included reviews were critically appraised using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) checklist. A factor was considered highly influential if it appeared consistently across diverse populations and regions and demonstrated conceptual robustness beyond specific contextual settings. A total of 62 revisão sistemáticas were included, synthesizing findings from over 2,800 primary studies conducted across diverse populations and geographic regions. Five key factors influencing TCIM use were identified: socioeconomic status, dissatisfaction with conventional care, internal locus of control, preference for natural or holistic approaches, and perceived usefulness. Among these, perceived usefulness, defined as an individuals belief that a TCIM modality is useful for a specific health need, emerged as the most consistent and globally relevant determinant of TCIM use. Across contexts, individuals were unlikely to adopt TCIM unless they perceived it to have a specific benefit, even when scientific validation was lacking. This determinant, perceived usefulness, has significant implications for integration of TCIM into healthcare. For TCIM to be meaningfully embedded, integration strategies must reflect and support community-defined values. Health authorities can use perceived usefulness to identify not only which TCIM modalities are most used and trusted but also the specific benefits people believe they offer. Developing national profiles based on these perceptions can help align policies with real-world demand and cultural health priorities. Aligning research agendas and resource allocation with perceived benefits further bridges the gap between lived experience and scientific evidence, enabling safe, baseado em evidence integration of trusted TCIM practices into mainstream care. Moreover, perceived usefulness supports long-term engagement. Individuals who view TCIM as beneficial are more likely to adhere to these tratamentos and incorporate them into their broader care plansenhancing resultados, satisfaction, and the sustainability of integration. This approach promotes patient engagement, continuity of care, and health system responsivenesscritical elements of successful integration. Ultimately, emphasizing perceived usefulness can build trust in both TCIM and conventional healthcare, fostering more inclusive, culturally responsive, and effective health systems that meaningfully advance universal health coverage. Perceived usefulness is a globally consistent factor underpinning TCIM use and should be considered the cornerstone of TCIM integration into healthcare systems. Strengthening saúde pública through TCIM requires acknowledging the perceived benefits and lived experiences that shape individuals health decisions. Integration efforts that reflect these community-based perceptions can align services with local norms, support continuity of care, and advance global health goals, while honoring the diverse ways people understand healing and wellness.",

    "abstract": "In anthroposophic medicine, the comprehension of the human being integrates physical and spiritual aspects of the individuality, leading to approaches essentially based on the patient history, observation, and biography of the person. Even considering the clinical manifestations of the subtle bodies, medical imaging techniques may constitute an important tool for diagnosis and follow-up of the therapies, which also applies to other integrative methods. Specially considering the metabolic conditions, physiologic manifestations in the diagnosis and follow-up of the patients. As example, brain FDG-PET/CT images can reveal metabolic alterations in the diagnosis phase and after anthroposophic therapies; diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) can show the differences between the water molecule transit in different pathological conditions, considering different organs and tissues. In this context, this study brings examples of the role of the medical imaging techniques to describe the metabolic manifestations related to neurological and other metabolic manifestations. Furthermore, the work aims to bring to the Integrative Medicine Community an overview of the new medical imaging diagnostic techniques as relevant tools in the initial stage and follow-up of anthroposophic and other integrative therapies. This work brings a review and examples of cases where the medical imaging techniques (computed tomography, nuclear medicine, magnetic resonance imaging, etc.) are applied to characterize the metabolic and anatomical process approached by the anthroposophic and other integrative medicine methods. The neurological conditions as such as encephalitis, paraneoplastic syndromes, tumors and epilepsy are examples of clinical manifestations that can get benefits from these techniques, not restricted to neurology. The presentation also brings the main basis of the new medical images and their potentialities to improve the definition of the therapeutical approaches and follow-up of the patients submitted to the integrative medicine therapies. The study verified that anthroposophic and other integrative medicine techniques can leverage new imaging techniques in several ways, as such as complementing qualitativo assessments, validating the patient's condition, the comprehension of physical body, despite the complementary views of different integrative methods, acting as new lens to integrate the understanding of the subtle bodies. In the neurological approaches, nuclear medicine images, as such as PET/CT, have expressed a relevant role to characterize the brain metabolic conditions before and after the use of integrative medicine methods. In a case of patient with autoimmune ancephalities, it was possible to observe notable metabolic changes in the brain. Furthermore, these methods bring answers and tools to elaborate a personalized tratamento planning, as well as to improve the mechanisms of early detection and prevenção of diseases used in the integrative practices, also allowing the constant monitoring of the therapeutic efetividade and validation of the integrative therapeutical approaches, reinforcing their importance in various scientific fields. New medical imaging techniques and tools offer powerful objective insights into the physical and physiological aspects of health. For integrative and anthroposophic medicine approaches, these tools can serve as valuable complements, aiding in diagnosis, personalized tratamento planning, monitoring progress, and potentially contributing to research that bridges the gap between conventional and holistic understandings of health.",

    "abstract": "Lowbush blueberry, Vaccinium angustifolium Aiton (Ericaceae), is a shrub that is native to Canada. Various parts of the lowbush blueberry have a long history of use for food and medicine by the First Nations of Canada and the colonists who came later. Original ethnobotanical field work and literature review have been combined to document lowbush blueberrys common names, scientific name and synonyms, parts used, botanical description, distribution, agronomic information, traditional uses, phytochemical constituents, known adulterants, in vitro and in vivo preclinical information, pharmacological and clinical studies in humans, potential therapeutic indications, dosage, segurança information, and regulatory status of lowbush blueberry products in Canada. A monograph on lowbush blueberry has been prepared for the Pan-American Compendium of Medicinal Plants hosted by the Brazilian Academic Consortium for Integrative Health (CABSIN). Key criteria for inclusion of Pan-American medicinal plants in the compendium are: (1) Is it cultivated or sustainably harvestable (2) Are there products on the market (3) Is there preclinical evidence (4) Is there clinical evidence of segurança and efficacy (5) Are the responsible molecules known The objective of this project is to create an online compendium of medicinal plants of the Americas so that health professionals, national medicinal plant policy makers, industries, and consumers can have a validated instrument for the proper management and use of native and exotic medicinal plants, based on tradition and supported by quality scientific information. It is hoped that this Pan-American Compendium of Medicinal Plants, a work in progress, will facilitate the use of native and exotic plants from the Pan-American region, based on scientific evidence of their segurança and efficacy and quality control, and so enhance atenção primária accessibility and integration.",

    "abstract": "Tuina has the effect of releasing muscles, which is an important principle for relieving muscle cramps and an key therapeutic principle of tuina. Tuina has a great number of manipulations to release muscles with rich scientific connotations. Existing studies have shown that tuina may achieve the effect of releasing muscles through promoting blood circulation, warming, and relieving pain, so a hypothesis is put forward that \"the releasing effect of tuina is achieved through promoting blood circulation, warming, and relieving pain\". A total of 24 SD rats were randomly divided into control group (6 rats) and model group (18 rats). Muscle spasm was simulated using the myofascial pain syndrome (MPS) model in the model group. After successful modeling, the rats were randomly divided into the model group, kneading group, and plucking group. Kneading group and plucking group performed kneading and plucking manipulation separately using a massage manipulation simulator. Evaluating analgesic, warming, and blood-activating characteristics through pain threshold detection, infrared thermal imaging, laser speckle, etc.; observing the biomechanical and morphological changes of the gastrocnemius muscle through the Myoton Pro digital muscle function system and transmission electron microscopy. The pain threshold results showed that after intervenção, the PWT (Pain Withdrawal Threshold) and PWL (Pain Withdrawal Latency) in the kneading group, and plucking group were all significantly increased compared with the model group. The infrared thermal imaging and laser speckle results showed that the muscle surface temperature and blood flow in the kneading group and the plucking group were higher than that of the model group. The biomechanical results showed that after intervenção, the muscle tension and hardness of the four groups(kneading, plucking, rolling, and stretching) were all lower than those before intervenção, and also lower than those in the model group after intervenção. The muscle elasticity was higher than that before intervenção, and also higher than those in the model group after intervenção. The electron microscopy results showed that the myofibrils in the model group were irregularly disorganized, with blurred Z-line, not clear light and dark bands, shortened sarcomeres, and abnormal morphology; the myofibrils in the kneading, plucking, rolling, and stretching groups were arranged more orderly, with clearer light and dark bands, and increased mitochondria. Both the kneading and plucking manipulation can all restore the tension, hardness, and elasticity of the gastrocnemius muscle, improve the ultra-structure of the gastrocnemius muscle, as well as have pain-relieving, warming and prototing blood circulation effects.",

    "abstract": "Chronic pain is a highly prevalent condition that significantly compromises physical, psychological, social, and environmental aspects of qualidade de vida. Among complementary health approaches, osteopathic manipulative tratamento seeks to evaluate and manage individuals globally, aiming to reduce symptoms and restore functional balance. Despite its clinical use, there is a scarcity of high-quality studies assessing the efetividade of osteopathy in chronic musculoskeletal conditions. Considering the high number of patients affected and the impact of pain on daily life, this study aimed to investigate the effects of osteopathic tratamento on qualidade de vida, assessed through the WHOQOL-Bref questionnaire. Methods  Design: Randomized ensaio clínico  Setting: Osteopathy Clinic  Brazilian Institute of Osteopathy, University Hospital of Santa Catarina  Participants: 20 patients with dor crônica  Study Group (SG): n = 10  Control Group (CG): n = 10  Randomization: Participants randomly allocated into SG and CG  Assessment tool: WHOQOL-BREF (Quality of Life Questionnaire)  Applied at baseline (pre-tratamento)  Applied at the end of the protocol (post-tratamento)  Intervention:  SG: 4 osteopathic medical tratamentos  CG: no intervenção for 2 months Results  Between-group comparison: No statistically significant differences (p > 0.05) were found between the Study Group (SG) and Control Group (CG) in baseline or final WHOQOL-BREF scores.  Within-group comparison: Neither SG nor CG showed significant changes between baseline and final assessments.  Trend: The SG presented higher mean values in all quality-of-life domains (physical, psychological, social relationships, and environment) at the final evaluation, despite the lack of statistical significance.  Direction of findings: Results suggest a potential positive effect of osteopathic tratamento, though interpretation should be cautious due to the small sample size. Discussion  Although statistical significance was not achieved, the findings indicate a positive trend in favor of the osteopathic intervenção, with higher mean scores in the SG across all domains of qualidade de vida.  The absence of significant results may be explained by the small sample size (n=20), which limited the statistical power of the study to detect subtle differences.  Previous research has also reported benefits of osteopathy in managing dor crônica and improving qualidade de vida, but highlights the need for larger randomized ensaio clínicos with extended follow-up to strengthen the evidence.  The present study suggests that osteopathic tratamento may contribute to improvements in multidimensional aspects of well-being, reinforcing the relevance of further investigations with more robust designs. Conclusion  There was no significant difference between CG and SG regarding qualidade de vida resultados.  However, the Study Group showed a positive trend, with consistently higher mean scores in all domains at the end of the protocol.  Findings suggest potential benefits of osteopathic tratamento, although a larger sample size may be required to confirm statistical significance.",

    "abstract": "Caregivers have specific concerns and preferences when seeking healthcare for their young children affected by recurrent respiratory tract infections. In China, medical pluralism is widespread. Caregivers of sick children often seek tratamento from both biomedicine and traditional Chinese medicine practitioners. One traditional medicine practice is pediatric Tuina, a soft massage technique administered by trained providers, which has been used to prevent new respiratory infections. However, there is limited understanding of caregivers' perspectives on pediatric Tuina. By examining their healthcare-seeking patterns, this research aims to understand what are the reasons of caregivers in Southern China turn to pediatric Tuina for their childrens recurrent respiratory tract infections. A qualitativo descriptive interview design was used in this study. Participants were recruited using a convenience sampling technique. Sixteen mothers from Southern China, whose children had undergone pediatric Tuina in a ensaio clínico for recurrent respiratory tract infections, participated in online semi-structured interviews. Informed consent was obtained by first explaining the study's purpose to caregivers over the phone, followed by the exchange of signed printed forms via express delivery. The analysis was conducted using reflexive thematic analysis with NVivo qualitativo research software. The results indicate that caregivers primarily seek pediatric Tuina because they adopt a proactive and child-centered approach in choosing the appropriate type of care for sick children. Caregivers preferred self-learning of care and home remedies to avoid hospital visits, when the symptoms were mild. They typically sought hospital care when symptoms such as cough or fever appeared, as these are viewed as indicators for medical attention. Caregivers tended to favor healthcare providers who offer tailored tratamento plans and demonstrate a positive attitude. Due to the recurring and prolonged nature of the illness, along with access to multiple types of providers, caregivers prefer a combination, turning to biomedicine for symptom relief and Chinese medicine to address the root cause. They were also concerned about prolonged medication use, particularly antibiotics, and discontinued prescribed tratamentos based on their own judgment. These motivations highlight caregivers broader interest in holistic, personalized, and potentially less invasive healthcare options for children with RRTIs. This understanding is crucial for the healthcare providers in fostering effective communication, tailoring tratamentos, respecting cultural beliefs, and advancing research in pediatric care.",

    "abstract": "Pomegranate (Punica granatum) is rich in phenolic compounds, such as flavonoids and tannins, which possess potent antioxidant properties that neutralize reactive species and protect neural cells from oxidative stress, a factor associated with neurodegenerative diseases. Its anti-inflammatory properties reduce pro-inflammatory cytokines and preserve the integrity of the blood-brain barrier, generating interest in exploring its effects on the central nervous system. Zebrafish (Danio rerio), a widely used animal model in neuropharmacological research, allows for the precise and reproducible evaluation of these effects. This study aimed to evaluate the anxiolytic and antidepressant-like effects of the aqueous extract of pomegranate fruit (Punica granatum) in adult zebrafish. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee on Animal Use (CEUA-UECE #04009489/2023), and registered in the National System for the Management of Genetic Heritage (SisGen #A4A0900). Zebrafish were allocated to groups (n = 8/group) and treated orally (p.o.; 20 L) with the aqueous extract of pomegranate fruit (100% - 1 g/mL or 50% - 0.5 g/mL), or distilled water (control group). An additional naïve (untreated) group (n = 8) was included for comparison. Behavioral tests were conducted 1 h after tratamento. Initially, locomotor activity was assessed using the open field test. The animals were placed in Petri dishes divided into quadrants, and the number of times they crossed from one quadrant to another was recorded for 5 min. To assess ansiedade-like behavior, the animals were placed in a glass aquarium (30 × 15 × 20 cm) containing a light and a dark zone. The time (s) that the zebrafish spent in the clear zone over a 5 min period was recorded. For the evaluation of depressive-like behavior, the fish were immersed in 1% ethanol for 30 min and then suspended vertically, with the caudal half of their bodies immobilized. The mobility time (s) was recorded over a 5 min period. Pretratamento with the extract did not affect the locomotor activity of the animals but increased the time the zebrafish spent in the clear zone of the aquarium (p < 0.0001 vs. control and naïve) and enhanced mobility time (p < 0.01 vs. control - 50% extract and p < 0.001 vs. control -100% extract). The results show that pomegranate extract induces anxiolytic and antidepressant-like behaviors in adult zebrafish without affecting locomotion, highlighting its potential as a natural terapia for psychiatric disorders. These effects may modulate neural circuits involved in emotional regulation via antioxidant and anti-inflammatory actions. The zebrafish model, with conserved neurochemical pathways, offers translational value. Effects may involve serotonergic and GABAergic systems implicated in ansiedade and depressão. These findings open new avenues for the development of effective and safe phytotherapeutics, reinforcing pomegranate as a promising source of neuroprotection. The aqueous extract of pomegranate fruit (Punica granatum) demonstrated anxiolytic and antidepressant-like effects in adult zebrafish, highlighting its neuroprotective effect.",

    "abstract": "The integration of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and modern medicine in managing acute infectious diseases has progressed. However, studies focusing on the application, use patterns and therapeutic advantages of TCM are limited, leading to an unclear understanding of its role in managing acute infectious diseases. This research aims to explore public perceptions and expectations regarding the role of TCM in the prevenção and tratamento of acute infectious diseases through semi-structured interviews, and to clarify the positioning of TCM and provide theoretical and practical insights for its more effective application in disease control. A purposive sampling method was used and interviewees were recruited until data saturation. Semi-structured interviews were conducted and transcripts were organized and analyzed using NVivo software. A thematic analysis approach was adopted for coding and categorization. Finally, 25 participants, including patients with acute infectious diseases and their family members (aged 1956 years; 7 males and 18 females) were involved. A total of 82950 words were transcribed and preliminary analysis identified 67 codes, which were grouped into 26 themes and further refined into four domains: (1) The primary role of TCM in prevenção: This includes six themes such as dietary terapia, Chinese patent medicines, and Chinese herbal decoction, reflecting a general public consensus on the dominant role of TCM in preventing acute infectious diseases. (2) The stage-specific role of TCM in tratamento: Seven themes such as primary choice in mild cases, adjunctive role in severe cases, and recovery facilitation emerged under this category, indicating that the public tends to prefer TCM intervençãos (e.g., Chinese patent medicines, Chinese herbal decoctions, and dietary therapies) in the early, mild stage of illness. In cases of severe symptoms (e.g., persistent high fever or serious complications), a tratamento model dominated by modern medicine and supplemented by TCM is preferred. During the recovery phase, TCM becomes the primary choice for promoting rehabilitation. TCM has shown particular efficacy in managing symptoms such as low-grade fever, cough, fatigue, and muscle soreness. Additionally, traditional techniques such as cupping, acupuntura, tuina-massage, and herbal plaster terapia are used for symptom relief. (3) Cognitive barriers affecting confidence in TCM use: This category comprises seven themes, including conceptual confusion, lack of knowledge, and difficulties in pattern differentiation and medication use. These barriers partly undermine public confidence in the efficacy of TCM in disease prevenção and tratamento. (4) Public expectations for TCM in disease prevenção and tratamento: Six themes fall under this category, including science popularization, clinical research, and policy support, indicating that the public expects stronger efforts in TCM education and research, improved accessibility and affordability. TCM plays a dominant role in the prevenção of acute infectious diseases and assumes a complementary role alongside modern medicine during tratamento, depending on the stage of illness. To enhance public trust and utilization of TCM, efforts should focus on advancing clinical research, improving targeted health education, and promoting integrative development with modern medicine.",

This cross-sectional study was conducted in China in 2025 via both online (Wenjuanxing, https://www.wjx.cn) and offline questionnaires. Convenience sampling was applied among people with experiences of TCM tratamento for infectious diseases. By May, 2025, 639 valid questionnaires were collected (response rate98.92% ). Female respondents accounted for 66.67% and 305 respondents (47.73%) possessed a medical background (all majors or occupation related to medicine, such as clinicians, nurses, medical researchers, healthcare policy makers and medical students). For respiratory diseases, 336 respondents (52.58%) had used TCM for prevenção and 396 (61.97%) for tratamento, primarily targeting influenza (64.79%) and COVID-19 (48.67%). For gastrointestinal diseases, 233 respondents (36.46%) used TCM for prevenção and 249 (38.97%) for tratamento, mainly addressing Norovirus infections (13.15%). Concurrently, the majority of respondents indicated a preference for TCM methods as their first choice for preventing (76.37%)/treating (73.55%) infectious diseases, and 430 respondents (67.29%) primarily used Chinese medicinal formulas or Chinese patent medicines, while 515 respondents (80.59%) regularly stock TCM products at home. Regarding \"the most significant roles of TCM \" 388 respondents (60.72%) rated \"prevenção of infectious diseases\" as the priority, followed by \"symptom alleviation\" (20.03%), \" rehabilitation\" (12.51%) and \"acute phase control\" (5.63%). Respondents (275,43.04%) identified \"lack of standardized tratamento protocols\" as a key limitation in TCM's application for infectious disease, and the shortcomings of TCM included\" prolonged tratamento duration,\" (39.59%) \"bitter taste of medications,\" (36.15%)\"inconvenient administration,\" (35.68%) and \"unclear mechanisms of action in acute infectious diseases.\" (35.05%) Enhancing the standardization and normalization of TCM was the primary demand among 439 respondents (68.7%). Furthermore, over 55% of respondents highlighted the following requirements: \"Strengthening integration with modern medicine,\"(63.85%) \"Enhancing scientific research to provide more baseado em evidence support,\" (60.88%) \"Increasing publicity efforts to raise public awareness of TCM.\"(58.69%) and \"Improving the quality of TCM services.\"(58.53%) The survey indicates a generally high level of public recognition of TCM with particular emphasis on its role in preventing and treating infectious diseases. However, challenges remain in the application of TCM for infectious disease prevenção and tratamento, including a lack of standardization and poor tratamento experience. There is an urgent need to promote standardized and regulated development of TCM, strengthen its collaborative synergy with modern medicine, enhance scientific research, and improve public education and awareness to elevate societal understanding and trust in Traditional Chinese Medicine.",

    "abstract": "The growing global interest in Traditional, Complementary and Integrative Medicine (TCIM) has driven the implementation of public policies and the integration of these practices into national health systems in several countries, including Brazil. The inclusion of TCIM in medical education is crucial for expanding access, ensuring segurança and achieving the full integration of these modalities into healthcare, in order to address worldwide saúde pública challenges and uphold the right to therapeutic plurality. In Brazil, modalities such as acupuntura, phytoterapia, Reiki, and yoga, among others, are offered by the Unified Health System (SUS) in 86% of municipalities. However, only 21% of medical schools in the country incorporate TCIM content into their curricula, highlighting possible gaps in the education of future physicians. Educational strategies based on Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) have shown potential to enhance teaching and expand access to knowledge in various fields. Thus, this research aims to propose and evaluate a open-access educational application on TCIM as a support tool in the teaching-learning process of TCIM for medical students and faculty in Brazil. To the best of our knowledge, the application we developed, MedPICS, is the first Brazilian mobile learning application on TCIM, created as a result of acadêmico research. Its design is grounded in contemporary learning theories and all the content provided is based on scientific literature. It is available in a web version at https://medpics.vercel.app/index.html or on Google Play at https://play.google.com/store/apps/detailsid=com.domenicodejesus.MedPICS This is an applied, descriptive and qualitativo study, conducted in six stages: (1) literature review; (2) application development; (3) content review by two specialists with training in TCIM; (4) pilot testing of the prototype with 20 healthcare professionals and students from the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation; (5) post-test adaptations and improvements; and (6) use of the application by 35 medical students, followed by an evaluation using an online questionnaire based on the System Usability Scale (SUS), with 15 Likert-scale questions and two open-ended questions. The research is in its final phase. Preliminary results indicate that 91.4% of the students consider that the application contributes to TCIM education, of whom 60% strongly agreed and 31.4% agreed. 8.6% reported a neutral position. The final analysis of the collected data will allow for an assessment of the applications usability according to the System Usability Scale. Preliminary results suggest that the MedPics application is a high-quality tool with the potential to strengthen TCIM education, contributing to the reduction of gaps in the training of healthcare professionals in Brazil.",

    "abstract": "Cancer represents a serious global saúde pública problem, with high incidence and mortality rates driven by population aging. In Brazil, an estimated 704,000 new cases are expected annually for the 2023-2025 period. In response, the National Cancer Control Policy and Integrative and Complementary Practices (PICS) are fundamental for comprehensive care. Integrative Oncology, a patient-centered and baseado em evidence approach, utilizes PICS to complement conventional tratamento. It aims to manage psycho-emotional symptoms and efeitos adversos such as fatigue, nausea, and pain, understanding the disease within its social and emotional context. In synergy with the perspective of PICS in Oncology, this study proposes to investigate the dimension of comprehensive care through BioFAO Medicine. Its main objectives are to describe the responses to the use of BioFAO Medicine as PICS in Oncology, identify its relationship with the meanings of comprehensive care, and explore the impact of this tratamento on the well-being and qualidade de vida of cancer patients. This is a qualitativo and exploratory study, using semi-structured interviews with 8 physicians trained in BioFAO Medicine and 10 patients diagnosed with cancer who have been undergoing tratamento for at least one year. Data collection was conducted at the BioFAO Institute's Social Outpatient Clinic and in medical offices in Rio de Janeiro. The discourse analysis was based on Bardin's (2011) thematic content analysis. The preliminary analysis of interviews with physicians who practice BioFAO Medicine reveals the following perceptions: Medical Rationality: A distinct medical rationality approach that is complementarily integrated with conventional tratamentos and other Health Integrative Practices. Therapeutic Integration: Identification of potentials and challenges in integrating the BioFAO method with other therapies, emphasizing the need for interprofessional collaboration. Improvement in Quality of Life: Clinical observations indicating a perceived improvement in patients' qualidade de vida, focusing on physical and mental well-being aspects. Clinical Evolution: Reports of cases suggesting positive impacts on patients' clinical progression and qualidade de vida Based on the interviews conducted, both doctors and patients shared valuable insights. Healthcare professionals emphasized that the BioFAO Medicine approach promotes more comprehensive care, enhancing the emotional, mental, and physical well-being of the patient alongside conventional tratamento. Patients, on the other hand, reported feeling more confident about their physical health, noticed a reduction in the side effects of traditional tratamentos, and experienced an improvement in their qualidade de vida by incorporating a method that stimulates the self-organization of the Biocampo. These experiences reinforce the importance of a holistic view in oncological care, where tratamento goes beyond the disease and also considers the emotional and energetic aspects of the individual. The reports suggest that resources like BioFAO can accelerate recovery, increase patient autonomy, and strengthen the relationship between patients and healthcare professionals. Thus, the project demonstrates that integrating complementary approaches into oncological tratamento is essential to providing more humane, complete, and effective care, aligned with the principles of integrative oncology.",

    "abstract": "Lymphoma presents a growing global health challenge, with limited targeted therapies and increasing tratamento resistance. Gut microbiota-derived postbiotics, including Nisin (N) and Urolithin B (UB), are emerging as novel candidates for cancer therapeutics. Nisin, a bacteriocin produced by Lactococcus lactis, has demonstrated antimicrobial and anticancer activities. Urolithin B, a gut microbial metabolite derived from ellagitannins, exhibits anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antiproliferative properties. This study aimed to evaluate N and UB's antiproliferative and synergistic effects on human lymphoma cells and to investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms using proteomics. The antiproliferative effects of N, UB, and their combinations were assessed in the HKB-11 human lymphoma cell line using the Alamar Blue assay. Drug synergy was quantified by the Combination Index (CI) method. Mechanistic insights were explored through reactive oxygen species (ROS) measurement, apoptosis quantification via flow cytometry, and bottom-up proteomic profiling of mono- and co-treated cells. N and UB exhibited antiproliferative activity with IC50 values of 1467 µM and 87.56 µM, respectively. Their combination at a 4:6 ratio showed strong synergism (CI = 0.09 at IC95), significantly enhancing apoptosis (p < 0.0001) and modulating intracellular ROS. Proteomics analysis revealed critical protein alterations affecting mitochondrial function, lipid metabolism, cell cycle, and apoptosis. Notable changes included upregulation of COX6C (Log2FC = 2.07) and downregulation of CDK4 (Log2FC = -1.26), indicating involvement in mitochondrial respiration and G1-S phase arrest, respectively. These findings suggest that the combined tratamento modulates multiple cancer-related pathways. The synergistic effects of Nisin and Urolithin B demonstrate the therapeutic promise of postbiotics in lymphoma tratamento. The molecular alterations observed support further investigation through in vivo validation and clinical evaluation.",

    "abstract": "Musculoskeletal and other pains represent a high burden for society as a whole worldwide. The tratamento of dor crônica should be multimodal according to guidelines and the biopsychosocial model. Non-pharmacological tratamentos of complementary and integrative medicine as well as art terapia have few side effects and can be a valuable addition. The effects of integrated tratamentos are underrepresented in high-quality university research. In November 2024, Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin a ward for interdisciplinary multimodal pain terapia (IMST). This ward is managed by orthopaedics and anaesthesiology. The multimodal tratamento concept includes manual and osteopathic medicine, acupuntura, aromaterapia, movement terapia, breathing terapia, Qi Gong, atenção plena exercises, nutritional counseling and art terapia. It is our aim to conduct ongoing scientific research into the characterization of IMST patients, their tratamento successes and our multimodal terapia. We are conducting a prospective register study (evidence level IIb) on the IMST. The endpoints include the subjectively perceived pain intensity within the last 7 days, measured using a numerical rating scale (NRS, 0-10), the achievement of subjective tratamento goals (in 10% increments) and satisfaction with the personal tratamento success (0 = dissatisfied, 5 = very satisfied) from the patient's perspective. The data was collected using paper questionnaires and implemented in REDCap (version 14.5.43). The data was analyzed descriptively using SPSS version 30. Between November 4, 2024 and December 20, 2024, 14 predominantly geriatric and multimorbid patients were included in the study. The tratamento concerns from the patient's perspective were predominantly musculoskeletal pain. Pain intensity was reduced by 35% from start to end of terapia to a median (Q1;Q3) of 5/10 (4;5). A 50% reduction in pain was achieved in 5 out of 14 participants. The patients' primary tratamento goals were a reduction in pain, an improvement in sleep quality and learning coping strategies. The goals were achieved by 50% (median). The median satisfaction rating (Q1;Q3) was 4.5 (4;5). Immediately after opening the inpatient IMST, we saw predominantly geriatric patients with predominantly musculoskeletal pain who achieved a clinically relevant reduction in pain and were very satisfied with the success of the tratamento. By October 2025, we expect data on the characterization of patients and the tratamento success of around 80 patients, which will be reported together with lessons learned.",

    "abstract": "The global surge in ansiedade and depressão underscores the urgent need for complementary, baseado em evidence strategies in mental healthcare. Hericium erinaceus (Lion's Mane mushroom), a culinary and medicinal fungus traditionally used in Chinese Medicine, has shown promising neuroregenerative, anxiolytic, and antidepressant effects. This study aims to assess its clinical applicability within an integrative health model, emphasizing the gut-brain axis, neuroplasticity, and inflammatory modulation. This ongoing integrative literature review follows PRISMA guidelines and searches the PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases. Inclusion criteria cover preclinical and clinical studies published between 2015 and 2025 that explore neuroprotective, cognitive, and psychotropic effects of Hericium erinaceus. Keywords used include 'Hericium erinaceus', 'Lion's Mane', 'neurogenesis', 'depressão', 'ansiedade', 'gut-brain axis', and 'inflammation'. Risk of bias and methodological quality were assessed using CASP and SYRCLE tools. Preliminary analysis of 38 selected studies indicates consistent evidence that H. erinaceus stimulates nerve growth factor (NGF) synthesis, enhances hippocampal neurogenesis, and modulates the microbiotagutbrain axis. Clinical trials have reported reduced depressive symptoms, improved cognitive performance, and better sleep quality. Anti-inflammatory effects and upregulation of BDNF expression were also observed in both animal models and human participants. Findings support the potential of Hericium erinaceus as a neurofunctional agent within integrative medicine. Its unique bioactive compoundshericenones and erinacinespromote neural regeneration and psychological resilience, particularly in ansiedade-depressão syndromes. This research emphasizes the importance of bridging ethnopharmacology and neuroscience in developing holistic, safe, and accessible therapeutic approaches. Hericium erinaceus emerges as a promising adjunct in mental health tratamento within TCIM, fostering neuroplasticity, emotional regulation, and gut-brain axis balance. Further controlled studies and translational health initiatives are warranted to confirm and expand its clinical use.",

    "abstract": "Trissomy 21 (T21) is a risk factor for gastrointestinal disorders as well as for increased aluminum absorption. Our objective was to describe in a sample of Brazilian T21 children attended by a pediatrician or nutritionist with expertise in T21 the frequency of alterations in some blood (aluminum, immunoglobulins for food allergy and celiac disease) and fecal (calprotectin) tests requested by the expert for the initial and/or follow-up consultation. Moreover, we also describe occurrence of food allergies and celiac disease as well as adoption of some lifestyle habits (gluten- and/or dairy-free diet, avoidance of aluminum cookware). This longitudinal cross-sectional study was approved by the Ethics Committee on Human Research from the State University of Londrina (3.637.165/2019) and data was collected from January 2020 to January 2022. Families with a T21 member under 18 years-old answered a survey on health issues, use of nutritional supplements and lifestyle habits. They also shared the results of laboratorial exams collected for the first (n=102 participants) as well as follow-up (n=73 participants) consultation with the expert. Use of probiotics, adoption of gluten and/or dairy-free diets and avoidance of aluminum-containing cookware or food package were reported by some families before the initial consultation, but the frequency increased at the follow-up. Among the participants with increased fecal calprotectin (n=13) or blood aluminum (n=10) levels at the initial consultation, there was a significant decrease in the follow-up (Students paired t test, p<0.05). Milk and egg allergies were reported by 14% and 7.4% of the participants. Celiac disease was reported by 2% of the participants and 1 participant was positive for anti-gliadin IgA. The present study sheds light on the importance of monitoring fecal calprotectin and seric aluminum in T21 children as well as on the intervenção to improve the general health of these persons.",

Initially, the references were screened in Rayyan by blinded pairs for selection and categorization of reviews. REDCap is currently being used for a detailed analysis of the intervençãos and resultados. Preliminary results reveal a wide range of nature-based intervençãos implemented across various contexts and populations. These include: accessible natural environments; outdoor activities on walking, cycling, or hiking trails in vegetated urban settings; community gardens or allotments; forest bathing; therapeutic mud and sea baths; nature play; outdoor education and work programs; the design of daycare or school grounds; exposure to vegetated urban landscapes and green corridors; contact with natural elements in settings such as hospitals, nursing homes, indoor gardens, workplace and shopping center plants, public parks, and gardens; forest schools, outdoor classrooms, and forest learning environments; ecological gyms and environmental volunteering; outdoor exercise groups; visits to medicinal water sources; and wildlife programs in natural environments, as well as desert therapies.The analysis of revisão sistemáticas indicates a significant use of nature-based intervençãos with potentially positive effects on human health. In summary, this study consolidates knowledge on the impact of nature-based intervençãos from an interdisciplinary perspective, offering a comprehensive overview to inform future research, clinical practices, and public policies, while also encouraging the adoption of nature-based strategies for promoção da saúde and well-being across diverse contexts. The next stage in the development of the Health and Nature Evidence Map will involve assessing the methodological quality of the included reviews using the AMSTAR 2 instrument.",

    "abstract": "Disease relapse and terapia resistance remain key challenges in cancer tratamento. Dynamic epigenetic plasticity of (immunogenic) cell death pathways and cellular mosaicism of the tumor-immune ecosystem frequently cause terapia escape, which prevents complete recovery and ultimately triggers disease relapse. Ferroptosis, a novel form of iron-dependent redox and lipid peroxidation-regulated cell death was recently identified as a novel appealing tratamento strategy to overcome multidrug terapia resistance in different cancer types. Cell based ferroptosis bioassay guided fractionation of traditionally used medicinal plants (Ayurveda) and marine organisms (sponge/seaweed/microalgae) was performed in various terapia resistant cancer cell types (breast, neuroblastoma, multiple myeloma, colon cancer) to purify and identify new classes of anti-cancer phytochemicals. Various new ferroptosis bioactive (marine) phytomedicinal compounds were identified which overcome drug resistance through non-canonical ferroptosis, characterized by an increase in intracellular labile Fe(II) upon excessive activation of Nrf2 and heme oxygenase-1. Collectively, our data propose a novel therapeutic strategy to efficiently kill terapia resistant cancer cells by ferroptosis. We envision translational prospects of potential green-blue eco-sustainable cancer medicine applications of novel ferroptosis-bioactive (marine) phytochemicals. Integrative kinase network multi-omics systems biology approaches (i.e. \"kinotyping\") are currently being applied to predict cancer terapia response which might advance the therapeutic applicability of ferroptotic (marine) phytochemical compounds in cancer precision medicine.",

    "abstract": "Amid a 25% surge in global mental health burden following the COVID-19 pandemic and global population aging and rise of dementia and cognitive decline, an urgent need for innovative preventive strategies emerged. The concept of Brain Health, now pivotal in defining overall wellness, urges the development of broad-spectrum, efficacious, and easily disseminated approaches to alleviate chronic stress and allostatic load and enhance the overall mental and physical well-being across lifespan.The Brain Health movement champions the identification of modifiable risk and resilience factors across neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative periods, aiming to foster preventative intervençãos tailored to both at-risk individuals and the wider population. Mind-body intervençãos target the brain and body physiology associated with stress and allostasis, prioritizing lifestyle factors that reduce stress and improve brain health. This reflects a paradigm shift towards personalized, whole-person lifespan strategies that has gained traction within multiple stakeholder organizations. Dr. Lavretsky will describe the nuanced interactions among lifestyle, emotional states, and mental health in aging populations and how mind-body practices can facilitate brain health and overall wellness across the lifespan in psychiatric populations. Her presentation will describe several yoga and Tai Chi ensaio clínicos in aging adults that will demonstrate beneficial effects on brain health and biomarkers of stress and aging that can be a useful strategy for prevenção and tratamento of late life neuropsychiatric disorders. We previously demonstrated that yoga improved depressão, resilience, memory and executive functions, increased hippocampal choline concentrations, and modulated brain connectivity in older adults with mild cognitive impairment, while Tai Chi can be helpful for tratamento of depressão and improved psychological resilience. In the recent study (NCT03503669), we investigated the effects of Kundalini Yoga (KY) versus memory training (MET)on brain gray matter volume (GMV) changes in older women with cerebrovascular risk factors and subjective memory complaints. Compared to KY, MET showed reductions in GMV in left prefrontal, pre- and post-central, supramarginal, superior temporal and pericalcarine cortices, right paracentral, postcentral, superior and inferior parietal cortices, the banks of the superior temporal sulcus, and the pars opercularis. Right hippocampal volume increased after yoga intervenção. At 24-weeks follow-up, KY yielded a significant, large effect size improvement in subjective cognitive impairment measures compared to MET. On a transcriptional level, at 12- and 24-week follow-up, KY uniquely altered aging-associated signatures, including interferon gamma and other psycho-neuro-immune pathways. Levels of chemokine eotaxin-1, an aging marker, increased over time in MET but not KY participants. In another recent study of Tai Chi versus Health Education (HEW), TCC was superior to HEW in improving general health, and increased brain connectivity in the Default Mode network that correlated with improvements in depressão and resilience (NCT02460666) that illustrates the brain and whole person health benefits of mind-body therapies. These results suggest clinical and biological benefits to yoga and Tai Chi, linking changes to neuroprotective, neuroplastic and anti-inflammatory effects of mind-body therapies that can be used for tratamento and prevenção of neuropsychiatric disorders in aging adults.",

    "abstract": "A broad, interdisciplinary, international body of evidence indicates that heritage physical activities have strong value for health resultados across multiple dimensions. Heritage physical activities are defined in this context as those with regional, cultural, and/or traditional relevance and may include dances, sports and games, martial arts, and other movement practices. Some of these activities are well integrated in traditional, complementary, and integrative medicine globally (e.g., yoga, tai chi, qi gong). Many others (e.g., ethnic dances) are well known in communities to be of deep value for the health and wellbeing of self, family, community, spirit, and land, but are often not well integrated into health efforts. Synthesizing literature relevant to heritage physical activity can help to guide future work in this area from a global promoção da saúde perspective, including integration into clinical practices and lifestyle medicine goals. The Public Health Resonance Project is a global effort to synthesize this evidence base to produce actionable evidence that can be used by individuals, advocates, systems, and communities to improve health resultados and health equity locally and globally. This presentation will describe the Public Health Resonance Projects current protocol and plans for the synthesis from the global evidence base that will (i) describe the extent and nature of the literature supporting these practices, (ii) assess evidence gaps, (iii) apply a typology by population, location, and other variables, (iv) produce practical meta-data to be used to create an applied, accessible database. The evidence synthesis is currently in the protocol feedback stage. In this phase, numerous scholarly traditions and search terms have been identified and refined following input from the study team, a global team of experts, and library science expertise. Input is now being gathered from practitioners, scholars, clinicians, and other communities who would use this evidence synthesis. Following standardized protocols, presentation attendees will be invited to give input on (a) search terms and (b) relevant scholarly traditions. In the next phase, PubMed, EBSCOhost, Web of Science, PsycInfo, AnthroSource, SocIndex, ATLA Religion Database, Sports Medicine & Education Index, and SPORTDiscus will be searched for peer-reviewed, published literature related to one or more heritage physical activities. Using Covidence to manage the review, article titles and abstracts will be screened to determine relevance. Full-text screening and data extraction will then be completed including plans to enable continuous monitoring of intercoder reliability. An extraction template and guide have been developed and piloted to support this large-scale data integration. These have included iterative updates and refinements based on feedback from the research team and expert steering committee. Primary products of this work will include meta-data to support the planned global Heritage Physical Activity Database as well as a peer-reviewed journal articles following PRISMA for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines. Heritage physical activity is a promising area for promoção da saúde and health system inclusion. Supporting activities of known importance and value in communities can improve individual health, reduce health risk, and increase collective well-being across many dimensions. Integrating the large, diffuse global evidence on this multidisciplinary topic will support this.",

    "abstract": "Objectives: To describe the prevalence and profile of NZ osteopaths treating people experiencing headaches and migraines. This study is the first to describe this practice. Background: Manual and manipulative terapia intervençãos are commonly sought by individuals experiencing headaches or migraines. Evidence supports the use of manual terapia as part of the management of headache and migraine disorders. Osteopaths are health professionals who provide care for individuals experiencing headaches and migraines. However, there is a lack of data concerning the profile of osteopaths treating these conditions, in addition to their diagnostic and management strategies. Methods: The Osteopathy Research Connect-New Zealand (ORC-NZ), a practice-based research network for the New Zealand osteopathy profession, was established, and recruitment occurred between August to December 2018. Results: Two hundred and seventy-seven respondents provided responses to the headache and migraine items on the ORC-NZ practice questionnaire. Of these respondents, 235(84.8%) indicated treating headaches often, and 107 (38.6 %) indicated treating migraines often. Osteopaths who reported often treating patients with migraines and headaches were more likely to report clinically supervising associates and be collocated with a general practitioner. In terms of management, they tend to use HVLA (High Velocity Low Amplitude) techniques, are likely to treat TMJ ( temporomandibular joint) in the case of migraines, and the thoracic spine for patients with headaches. Further, NZ osteopaths frequently refer patients with migraines and/or headaches to other practitioners. NZ osteopaths treat patients with migraines and/or headaches and frequently refer them to other practitioners. NZ osteopaths are aware of the inter-professional approach required for this patient population. This abstract has been previously published even though it has never been presented in a Congress.

    "abstract": "Background: Menopause and the climacteric transition are characterized by hypoestrogenism and a variety of vasomotor, somatic and psychological symptoms that impair qualidade de vida. Although hormone replacement terapia (HRT) remains the standard tratamento in allopathic medicine, many women seek alternative therapies due to contraindications or personal preferences. Morus nigra L. (black mulberry) has a long history of ethnomedicinal use for alleviating climacteric symptoms in Brazil, owing to its affordability, accessibility and purported polyphenolic activity. Objective: To systematically review the literature on the therapeutic efficacy, segurança and chemical properties of Morus nigra in the management of climacteric and menopausal symptoms. A comprehensive search was conducted through PubMed, SciELO, BVS-Virtual Health Library, Cochrane Library and Embase, supplemented by manual searches in theses and dissertations. The PICO framework guided the strategy: P, perimenopausal women; I, M. nigra intervençãos; C, HRT or placebo; O, effects on climacteric symptoms. Search terms included Morus nigra (and synonyms) combined with menopause or climacteric. Articles in English, Portuguese or Spanish, with no time restrictions, were eligible. Data were extracted and synthesized by thematic categorization: mode of consumption, clinical resultados, efeitos adversos and phytochemical profiles. Screening proceeded in duplicate, with resolution of discrepancies by consensus. Of 76 records identified, 14 were duplicates and 58 were excluded on title/abstract review. Four studies met inclusion criteria: one cross-sectional survey (25 %), one randomized controlled trial (25 %), one clinical cohort (25 %) and one ethnobotanical laboratory study (25 %). Consumption Patterns: All clinical investigations (75 %) evaluated M. nigra leaf preparations as tea, attributed to low cost and cultural prevalence. Clinical Efficacy: In the RCT, daily M. nigra leaf powder for 60 days significantly reduced vasomotor symptoms (hot flashes, p < 0.01) and somatic complaints (insomnia, fatigue; p < 0.05) versus placebo, with effect sizes comparable to low-dose HRT. The clinical cohort study corroborated improvements in sleep, mood, memory, functional capacity, mental health and pain (p < 0.05). Safety Profile: Adverse events were mild and infrequent: increased diuresis, flatulence and appetite (10 %). The RCT noted modest elevations in fasting glucose ( + 8 mg/dL, p < 0.05) and free thyroxine ( + 0.4 ng/dL, p < 0.02) and estradiol ( + 35 ng/dL, p < 0.02), warranting monitoring. Phytochemistry: Laboratory analyses demonstrated significant antioxidant activity at 10 mg/mL and moderate antiglycation potential. Polyphenolic compounds, chiefly flavonoids, were implicated in symptom relief. Current evidence suggests that Morus nigra leaf preparations may offer a safe, culturally acceptable adjunct or alternative to HRT for climacteric symptoms, particularly vasomotor and somatic complaints. However, findings are limited by small sample sizes, heterogeneity of intervençãos and short follow-up. Rigorous, large-scale randomized trials with standardized extracts and long-term segurança assessments are essential to substantiate clinical recommendations and elucidate mechanisms of action.",

    "abstract": "Despite decades of research, the management of bronchiolitis remains limited to supportive care, which addresses only the childs immediate functional needs. This often leads to frustration and distress in both parents and healthcare professionals. Within a multicenter randomized controlled trial (RCT) on lavender oil chest wraps (LCWs) for infants hospitalized with bronchiolitis, we explored nurses views and experiences with LCWs as a complementary approach to standard conventional care, with the objective of understanding the impact of LCWs on patients, their parents and nursing practice. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with pediatric nurses from two Swiss hospitals involved in a ensaio clínico on LCWs for bronchiolitis. Interview transcripts were analyzed using a qualitativo descriptive approach, aimed at providing a rich summary of participants ideas, experiences and opinions. Results: 18 nurses were interviewed. In view of the lack of effective pharmacological tratamento and the frequent feeling of doing nothing, LCWs emerged as a valuable complementary care strategy for both parents and nurses. Nurses observed calming and anxiolytic effects of LCWs, as well as reduced coughing and discomfort and improved breathing and sleeping in affected infants. Nurses also described soothing and reassuring effects of LCWs on parents, which improved the therapeutic relationship. Confidence in LCWs' effects tended to be higher in nurses with greater familiarity and experience with integrative care practices. Furthermore, nurses experienced a new quality of care associated with the implementation of LCWs and highlighted LCWs value beyond symptom relief as part of a more holistic, patient-centered and relational approach. Regarding the routine integration of LCWs in hospital settings, nurses identified time constraints, organizational issues and specific training needs as important factors. Discussion: This study suggests that LCWs may enhance the effects of minimal handling in bronchiolitis care, supporting an integrative approach to complementary and conventional care in hospital settings. Our findings also highlight that implementing traditional, complementary and integrative medicine (TCIM) approaches implies not only the introduction of new procedures, but also the fostering of a holistic approach to care. These results can inform future implementation strategies for TCIM. Methodologically, our findings demonstrate the value of qualitativo research in the context of RCTs, offering context-specific insights that may aid in interpreting clinical resultados. The integration of complementary therapies such as LCWs into routine care may offer benefits beyond symptom relief. Qualitative research alongside RCTs of new therapies should be encouraged to provide a more comprehensive understanding of their impact on patients, caregivers and healthcare professionals, while also providing valuable insights into the implementation of TCIM intervençãos in real-world settings.",

    "abstract": "Originally rooted in Buddhist philosophy, atenção plena is one of the eightfold path elements to the alleviation of human suffering. In Western contexts, atenção plena has been conceptualized as a secular program comprising a set of practicesincluding breathing exercises, meditação and yogadesigned to enhance attentional self-regulation and foster attitudes such as openness, curiosity, and acceptance. Empirical evidence suggests that regular atenção plena practice improves emotional regulation and overall psychological well-being. A diagnosis of a life-threatening illness, such as cancer, often followed by invasive procedures and tratamentos associated with a range of physical and psychosocial symptomsincluding pain, fatigue, and ansiedadefrequently leads to a substantial decline in qualidade de vida. Mindfulness training has been shown to help with the management of symptoms related to chronic health conditions, supporting reductions in perceived stress, mood disturbances, ansiedade and depressive symptoms, while promoting emotional regulation skills. The Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction program (MBSR), developed by Jon Kabat-Zinn in the United States in 1979, was the first structured intervenção based on atenção plena principles. Its initial objective was to help individuals suffering from dor crônica by cultivating more adaptive coping strategies. Since then, the program has undergone cultural and contextual adaptations, including the Mindfulness-Based Health Promotion (MBHP), tailored for Latin American populations and protocols designed for individuals with cancer. Such adaptations are essential to accommodate cultural differences and the unique challenges of specific populations, ensuring the programs relevance and efetividade across diverse contexts. The objective of this study was to apply the Delphi method to evaluate proposed adaptations of the MBHP program for oncology patients, in order to ensure its clinical applicability. A Delphi panel was conducted with 19 experts (including physicians, psychologists, nurses and researchers) with experience in atenção plena and/or oncology. The aim was to reach a consensus evaluation of 10 proposed adaptations to the MBHP program, which were developed based on the researchers prior experience with pilot groups. Experts completed an online questionnaire using a 5-point Likert scale. Consensus was defined as 70% agreement, calculated by combining the responses \"Agree\" and \"Strongly Agree.\" Results The response rate was 89.47% (17/19). All 10 proposed adaptations reached consensus, with five receiving 70% agreement at the Strongly Agree level, and five meeting the consensus threshold when combining the Agree and Strongly Agree responses. Discussion The study confirmed the feasibility and acceptability of the proposed adaptations to the MBHP program for oncology patients, providing support for its implementation and for future evaluations of its clinical impact. The main limitations of the study include the small sample size of experts and the absence of a second Delphi round, as consensus was achieved for all proposals in the first round. The research will proceed to a second phase, which involves offering the adapted MBHP program to online groups of oncology patients. This study was approved by a Research Ethics Committee (CAAE: 76610623.0.0000.5505). The findings indicate that all proposed adaptations to the MBHP program for oncology patients were validated by experts, ensuring greater confidence in its implementation.",

    "abstract": "The implementation of Integrative and Complementary Health Practices (ICHP) in Brazils Unified Health System (SUS) represents a significant step toward comprehensive care, addressing physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual dimensions of health. These practices have the potential to improve care quality, reduce medicalization, and promote user well-being, particularly in mental health contexts and the management of chronic conditions. Although officially regulated within SUS since 2006, the incorporation of ICHP into Primary Health Care (PHC) remains limited, constrained by gaps in professional training, cultural resistance, and structural barriers. Therefore, analyzing concrete experiences of implementation becomes essential to support their consolidation and expansion. In this regard, Primary Health Care Unit 1 of Cruzeiro Novo (UBS 1 CRZ), in the Federal District of Brazil, provides a unique setting for study, given its innovative integration of ICHP into routine care. This study aimed to analyze the adherence and perceptions of health professionals regarding the implementation of ICHP at UBS 1 CRZ, between March 2023 and May 2024. A qualitativo, descriptive, and exploratory study was carried out using a single case study design. Data collection included literature review, participant observation, and semi-structured interviews with 20 health professionals, comprising physicians, nurses, nursing technicians, physiotherapists, psychologists, pharmacists, nutritionists, social workers, and community health agents. Inclusion criteria required at least one year of experience at the unit. Participant observation captured daily dynamics and professional interactions, while interviews provided insights into perceptions and experiences with ICHP. Data were analyzed through Bardins content analysis (2011), encompassing pre-analysis, material exploration, and interpretation. Methodological triangulation was adopted to strengthen the validity of findings. The findings revealed that, despite initial challenges such as resistance among part of the staff and infrastructure limitations, adherence to ICHP was progressively consolidated, broadening therapeutic possibilities. User feedback emphasized concrete benefits, including reduced ansiedade, improved mood, relief from musculoskeletal pain, and better sleep quality. Two singular contributions emerged as central resultados: the role of continuous professional training, which enhanced confidence and competence in offering ICHP, and the development of an interactive digital application, designed to support prescription, follow-up, and dissemination of ICHP. These elements underscore the innovative dimension of the study and its potential relevance for other PHC contexts. The study demonstrated that the implementation of ICHP in PHC, when supported by professional training and technological resources, strengthens comprehensive care and fosters humanization within SUS. The experience at UBS 1 CRZ shows that ICHP not only improve users health and well-being but also strengthen bonds between professionals and patients, promoting a more collaborative care environment. Similar initiatives should be encouraged in other SUS units, consolidating ICHP as a sustainable saúde pública policy.",

    "abstract": "Acute pain management after resection of soft tissue tumors (STTs) of the extremities is based on pharmacologics. Current guideline recommendations highlight the growing importance of non-pharmacologic therapies such as acupuntura. This pilot study aims to investigate the effect of acupuntura on pain relief after STT surgery of the extremities. This prospective single-arm, single-centre study included 25 patients who underwent surgical tratamento of STTs of the extremities. Acupuncture was performed on the first postoperative day (POD), the pain intensity was assessed at different time points via numeric rating scale (NRS). Acupuncture was to be repeated on the third POD if the pain at rest was 3 / 10 on NRS. The function of the affected limb and qualidade de vida before and after surgery were assessed using validated questionnaires. Twenty-five patients (mean age 60,7 years) were included. Most tumors were malignant, located in the lower extremities, with a mean size of 8.5 cm (3-18). Mean surgery time was 68.4 (± 35.6) minutes ; 72% underwent wide resection. Postoperative pain at rest was low (median NRS 1 (± 1) on POD 1, 0 (± 0,8) thereafter). The lowest pain scores were observed on POD 2. Acupuncture was administered on POD 1 in all cases. Placement of acupuntura needles at the optimal position was feasible in 8 out of 25 patients; in the remaining cases, access was primarily impeded by surgical tapes and wound sites. Median hospital stay was four days. Global health scores remained stable; functional scores declined temporarily. Wound complications occurred in six patients; however, none were attributable to acupuntura. No other serious adverse events were observed. Acupuncture was feasible, safe, and well accepted in the postoperative setting of STT resection. The primary impediment to acupuntura administration was the placement of wound dressings and the surgical wound itself. Pain levels and the need for opioid prescription remained low throughout the postoperative period. Further controlled studies are needed to evaluate the efficacy of acupuntura, to optimize patient selection and acupuntura technique in patients with STTs of the extremities.",

    "abstract": "Caloric and emotional nutrition and social interaction are essential for child development, allowing the child to contribute to a more just society. Adverse childhood experiences (ACE) are associated with health problems in adulthood, such as obesity (KEIRNS et al., 2023), diabetes (CHU et al., 2021), suicide (LEE et al., 2023), and heart disease (AKASAKI et al., 2021), as well as psychopathologies such as depressão, ansiedade, and social withdrawal (FELITTI, 2019; MCLAFFERTY et al., 2019). This ongoing study investigates acute and chronic stress in 2,000 children (of both sexes) aged 8 to 14 years from the public school system of Curitiba, using three methods: screening questionnaire, salivary cortisol curve and Bio-Well. To avoid biases, the questionnaires identify pathologies, psychopathologies, neurological diseases, and the use of medications that alter cortisol, such as corticosteroids (HENZEN et al., 2000; BUSBY et al., 2020). Neurological diseases, such as malformation of the adenohypophysis (LIU et al., 2023), and psychopathologies, such as ADHD, ansiedade, and depressão, which affect the HPA axis (HAVELKA et al., 2016; BERENS et al., 2023), are also considered. Children with these conditions will be excluded. The cortisol curve will be obtained by three salivary collections on the same day (morning: 8am-9am; afternoon: 4pm-5pm; night: 10pm-11pm), following the protocol: do not brush teeth before collection; be fasting; avoid physical activity; not be in the catamenial period; store in a ventilated place, not requiring refrigeration. The samples will be stratified by gender and age and analyzed by immunochemistry with luminescence (FONSECA, 2024). The Bio-Well captures information from the little and middle fingers, identifying acute and chronic stress. Studies confirm its replicability (KOROTKOV, 2008; 2018) and efetividade in assessing health and stress in children (VALVERDE et al., 2025; OLGA et al., 2021; BABELYUK et al., 2017). Correlations with hormonal profile have been demonstrated (OLGA et al., 2017). Statistical analysis uses binomial and ordered logistic regression in the Stata software (version 19). In binomial logistic, the explanatory variables (variations in the cortisol curve) are categorical, and the dependent variable Y (with or without alteration in the Bio-Well) is dichotomous, according to the equation: P(y=1|x)=P(y=1|x, x, ..., xk). In the ordered logistics, the following are described: Bio-Well=C0 +B0 cortisol+B1 cortisol1+B2 cortisol2+B3 cortisol3+e. The Bio-Well refers to the result obtained by individual i in the Bio-Well test; C0 refers to the constant of the expression; BThe cortisol refers to the coefficient to the cortisol level when no point is altered (cortisol0); B1 is the coefficient related to the cortisol level when there is a point of change in the curve (cortisol1); B2 is the coefficient of the cortisol level when there are two points of change in the curve (cortisol2); B3 is the coefficient related to the cortisol level when there are three points of change in the curve (cortisol3); e is the error. (AGRESTI, 2006). The study seeks to identify children at risk and propose tratamento protocols for the saúde pública network of Curitiba, promoting early and effective intervençãos.",

    "abstract": "Colonial power relations have historically imposed a biomedical model in health, often treating the body as an object and care as a commodity. In Brazil, the National Policy for the Healthcare of Indigenous Peoples (PNASPI) established Differentiated Care (AD) to counteract this legacy by recognizing cultural specificities. However, the implementation of this policy is hindered by a lack of systematized data on traditional medicine specialists and their care technologies. In response, the project \"Indigenous Care Technologies: Participatory Mapping of Specialists in Indigenous Medicines in the State of Ceará  MAPÊMI\" was created to address this gap. Its main objective is to conduct a participatory mapping of these specialists to value ancestral knowledge and support the integration of these practices into the official health system (SASI-SUS). The project's methodology is based on a participatory approach, with its first six-month phase focusing on three pillars: institutional formalization, material development, and the training of indigenous researchers. Key activities included obtaining ethical approval from the Research Ethics Committee (CEP), with final approval from CONEP pending, registering the project in SISGEN and with FUNAI, and developing a visual identity and research instruments. The core of this phase was the selection of 11 indigenous researchers through a public call and a five-day training course held in the Tremembé indigenous land. This training covered the foundations of participatory mapping, recording techniques, data management, and research ethics. The first phase successfully qualified the 11 indigenous fellows to conduct the research. The training course was a key resultado, fostering rich discussions where participants collectively constructed a holistic vision of \"indigenous health\" as an inseparable link between body, spirituality, and territory. They also differentiated the individual concept of \"well-being\" from the collective indigenous perspective of \"good living\" (bem-viver). The ethical dimension was a central point, establishing a commitment to sensitive listening and ensuring that traditional knowledge is not treated as a commodity. In conclusion, the initial phase of the MAPÊMI project successfully established a solid foundation for the field mapping stage. The training course proved to be a key milestone for political and conceptual alignment, reinforcing the agency of indigenous researchers in the production of knowledge about their own healing practices. The project is a strategic action to give practical meaning to Differentiated Care and now awaits final ethical clearance to move forward with the documentation and valorization of the indigenous medicines of Ceará.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic significantly disrupted the acadêmico landscape, introducing abrupt changes that deeply affected university students. Even before the pandemic, this population already exhibited concerning levels of mental health issues. The additional stressors brought by the crisissuch as health-related uncertainty, social isolation, and the sudden shift to remote learningfurther intensified symptoms of ansiedade, stress, and sleep disturbances. With the return to in-person acadêmico routines in 2022, students encountered a new period of adjustment, which, in turn, imposed fresh mental health challenges and negatively impacted sleep quality. While psychotropic medications remain a widely adopted approach for managing these symptoms, there is increasing interest in complementary and alternative therapeutic strategies. Among them, Complementary Therapies (CT) such as Auriculoterapia and Floral Therapy have been recognized for their potential benefits. This study aimed to investigate the efetividade of Auriculoterapia and Floral Therapy in reducing ansiedade and improving sleep quality among undergraduate students at a public university in the interior of São Paulo, Brazil. This randomized ensaio clínico was conducted over a four-week period and included three groups: one received Auriculoterapia (A), another was treated with Floral Therapy (FT), and the third served as a control group without any intervenção. Participants were selected based on symptoms of ansiedade and poor sleep, previously identified through validated instruments: the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). These tools were administered before and after the intervençãos. Data were compiled using Microsoft Excel and analyzed using statistical models. Qualitative variables were described through absolute and relative frequencies, while quantitative variables were examined using linear regression and modified Poisson regression with robust variance, applying Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE). Out of 106 students initially enrolled, 64 completed all phases of the study and were included in the final analyses. Linear regression results showed significant reductions in PSQI scores for the FT group (-1.84, p = 0.0107) and the A group (-2.24, p = 0.0077), when compared to the control. Additionally, post-intervenção analysis revealed further score reductions of -2.73 (p < 0.0001) and -2.50 (p = 0.0002) for FT and A, respectively. The modified Poisson regression also suggested a reduced likelihood of poor sleep in the FT group following tratamento. For STAI-State scores, a deterioration was observed in both the A and control groups, while the FT group showed improvement. However, with regard to STAI-Trait scores, both FT and A groups experienced worsening results, implying limited impact of the intervençãos on more stable, long-term ansiedade patterns. Overall, both CTsAuriculoterapia and Floral Therapyproduced beneficial effects on sleep quality, with floral terapia showing the most consistent resultados. Nonetheless, neither intervenção demonstrated significant improvements in ansiedade, highlighting the need for longer-term studies to assess their full therapeutic potential.",

The disease generates social discomfort, professional and psychological harm to the patient. UI is more common in the geriatric phase and in women, and can be aggravated by the relaxation of the perineal muscles, as a result of age, and is a common problem among people living with Multiple Sclerosis (MS), around 90% - ABEM, 2014. The five movements of Seitai, which is a form of body work of Japanese origin, uses spontaneous movements combined with Contact Acupuncture, which is a non-invasive stimulus technique at specific points on the body. To evaluate the effect of the five spontaneous Seitai movements associated with Contact Acupuncture on whether or not there is an improvement in the discomfort caused by urinary incontinence (UI). Methods: A total of 9 female patients with MS and UI, aged 43 to 76 years. Clinical trial with 9 people diagnosed with MS and UI, received 8 tratamentos (1 tratamento per week for 8 uninterrupted weeks), performed five seitai movements and after being evaluated for each movement, received contact acupuntura and released after improvement in movement. Participants were evaluated before and after tratamento using the ICIQ-SF (International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire - Short Form in patients with urinary incontinence; Tamanini, 2004. There was an improvement in the ICIQ SCORE of 66.75%. Even with the improvement in the group with UI measured by the ICIQ SCORE, it would be necessary to increase the number of people evaluated to determine whether the percentage of improvement is maintained. It is possible to associate spontaneous movements to contact acupuntura to improve urinary incontinence in people with multiple sclerosis.",

    "abstract": "The practice of uterine steaming has gained increasing notoriety as a self-care approach in the context of integrative health. This study reviews the existing literature to define and contextualize the practice of DVT, exploring its cultural origins, application techniques, and potential benefits for women's gynecological health. The research is based on a conceptual analysis of diverse bibliographic sources, ranging from traditional texts to recent scientific studies. Historically, steaming has its roots in ancient practices in Mesoamerican and Asian cultures, where the use of herbal steam in the pelvic area was common in fertility and postpartum rituals. Today, the practice has been adopted as a means of promoting healing, treating conditions such as prolapse, and relieving menstrual symptoms. Although most of the evidence is anecdotal, there is growing interest in exploring its therapeutic effects, especially in relieving gynecological and emotional symptoms. The study also proposes a new terminology, Pelvic Steam Therapy (PVT), to include a broader range of beneficiaries, including men and people without uteruses. The study concludes that, while reports of benefits are promising, there is a significant gap in the scientific literature regarding protocols and application guidelines. Therefore, it is essential that future studies systematically investigate the effects of DVT and elucidate its mechanisms of action to promote safe and informed adoption of this practice in integrative health routines.",

    "abstract": "The management and tratamento of patients with fibromyalgia (FM) represent a clinical challenge, considering that the syndrome is multifactorial and often refractory to conventional therapeutic approaches, non-pharmacological therapies and patient education are strongly recommended. The FloreSer Program is structured in twelve weekly face-to-face meetings to apply a multidisciplinary care protocol aimed at women with fibromyalgia, through educational activities, Integrative and Complementary Health Practices (ICHP) and Social Technologies (ST), with a focus on promoting autonomy and strengthening self-care. In order to measure the functional capacity and health status of the participants, the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire - Revised Brazilian Portuguese version (FIQR-Br) was applied before and after the FloreSer Program. The sample consisted of 16 patients diagnosed with fibromyalgia, according to the criteria of the American College of Rheumatology, who were being medically monitored at the Chronic Pain Outpatient Clinic of a university hospital in southern Brazil. Participants who met the clinical criteria and voluntarily agreed to take part in the FloreSer Program were included and divided into two equal groups through stratified randomization. The study was approved by the institution's Human Research Ethics Committee, according to opinion number 63594322.9.0000.0105. The self-administered instrument used was the FIQR-Br. The questionnaire consists of 21 items organized into three main domains: function, general impact and symptoms. All the questions refer to personal experiences over the last seven days and are answered using 11-point numerical scales (ranging from 0 to 10), with higher scores indicating worse health and biggest impact of fibromyalgia. The total score is obtained by adding up the scores of the three domains, applying specific weights for each domain, resulting in a final score that can vary from 0 to 100 points. Two groups were analyzed: intervenção and control, with the intervenção group consisting of eight participants from the first edition, and the control group eight participants from the second edition of the program, both of whom were assessed using the FIQR-Br in the same period of time: one week before the start (T0) and in the closing week (T1) of the first edition of the program. After the data was collected, it was tabulated in a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet and the mean and median were calculated for each of the groups at T0 and T1. In the intervenção group, at T0, a mean of 69.05 and a median of 69.65 were obtained, while at T1, the mean became 48.45 and the median 43.50, showing a 37.5% reduction in the median score after the program. This result suggests that program participants had considerably reduced levels of fibromyalgia impact. In the control group, at T0, a mean of 61.61 and a median of 67.55 were obtained, while at T1, the mean was 57.54 and the median was 67.45, suggesting a minimal change in the median (0.2%) for the control group, which maintained standard tratamento during this period. Participants in the FloreSer Program experienced a reduction in the impact of fibromyalgia when comparing the initial and final stages and compared to the control group.",

    "abstract": "Reiki, used in approximately 15% hospitals in the USA1, is a technique to harmonize body, mind, spirit by stimulating the parasympathetic nervous system2. Considering that blood pressure (BP) alterations are risky in pregnancy, and that reiki could be a low-risk and cost-free method, the aim of this study was to assess the efetividade of a remote reiki session (RRS) in lowering BP in hospitalized high-risk pregnant women (HRPW), as an acute response and as BP behaviour considering the day before, the day of the session and the day after the RRS. HRPW, with a history of BP alterations, recently admitted to a hospital, were invited to participate and were randomly assigned to a control group (CG) or an intervenção group (IG) according to the order of admission and type of BP alteration; blinded for the interview researchers. Measures of BP were collected and re-collected before RRS and one hour later. The CG did not change anything in their routine, and the IG received a RRS, started just after of the first collection data. A month later, a medical student consults the data history, collecting all BP information registered by nurses during the day of the study, as well as the day before and the day after it. Mixed-effects models were employed to assess differences in systolic and diastolic BP, including group, time, and their interaction as fixed effects, with random intercepts for subjects. The statistical significance of the fixed effects and the interaction term was assessed using joint Wald tests. Within-group changes for each period were further examined using paired Students t-tests for both intervenção and groups. Data from 22 HRPW were analysed (IG=12; CG=10). The mixed-effects analysis of both systolic and diastolic BP revealed no statistically significant effects of group assignment, time, or their interaction. For systolic BP, neither the main effect of group (²(1)=0.01, p=0.9422), the effect of time across measurements (²(2)=2.03, p=0.3620), nor the group-by-time interaction (²(2)=0.03, p=0.9844) reached statistical significance. Similarly, for diastolic BP, none of the tested effects were significant: group (²(1)=0.15, p = 0.6999), time (²(2)=0.01, p=0.9966), or group-by-time interaction (²(2)=0.51, p=0.7738), as indicated by Wald chi-square tests. Furthermore, paired t-tests within each group revealed no significant acute changes in either systolic (IG: mean change=1.1 mmHg, p=0.68; CG: 2.6 mmHg, p=0.49) or diastolic BP (IG: 3.9 mmHg, p=0.39; CG: -1.3 mmHg, p=0.72). This study is the first found that analysed RRS on BP with HRPW without significant results of a single RRS on BP3. Mostly previous studies showed positive significant effects on BP in healthy people with one, two, six and 21 presential reiki sessions as well as with three RRS4-9. However, two other studies with post-caesarean delivery women did not find any alterations in BP after one or two presential reiki session10,11. Results indicate that a single RRS in HRPW did not produce significant alterations in BP. However, this data must be analysed carefully due to the number of participants. The therapist and the place of hospitalization should be considered for future studies.",

The disease generates social discomfort, professional and psychological harm to the patient. UI is more common in the geriatric phase and in women, and can be aggravated by the relaxation of the perineal muscles, as a result of age, and is a common problem among people living with Multiple Sclerosis (MS), around 90% - ABEM, 2014. The five movements of Seitai, which is a form of body work of Japanese origin, uses spontaneous movements combined with Contact Acupuncture, which is a non-invasive stimulus technique at specific points on the body. To evaluate the effect of the five spontaneous Seitai movements associated with Contact Acupuncture on whether or not there is an improvement in the discomfort caused by urinary incontinence (UI). Methods: A total of 9 female patients with MS and UI, aged 43 to 76 years.

    "abstract": "Brazilian red propolis has gained prominence in the field of Traditional, Complementary and Integrative Medicine due to its promising therapeutic properties, arousing growing interest from both the international market and the Federal University of Alagoas, with regard to scientific and technological development that supports quality certification and promotes its export. The Union of Red Propolis Producers of the State of Alagoas, as the requesting entity, registered the geographical indication of red propolis in 2012 with the National Institute of Industrial Property, under number IG 201101. This study explores the contributions of red propolis to global saúde pública, and by examining data from the International Agency of Research on Cancer published in 2022, its possible to observe 19,976,499 new incidence cases, with the five most prevalent types being: lung, breast, colorectal, prostate, stomach and liver cancers. The mortality rate reached 9,743,832 cases, with emphasis on lung, colorectal, liver, breast and stomach cancers. In light of these complex clinical challenges, such as cancer, its crucial to systematize the existing scientific knowledge on the subject. The objective of this review is to present and discuss recent scientific evidence on the effects of Brazilian red propolis in cancer tratamento. A narrative literature review was conducted, with an exclusive search on the PubMed database using the descriptor red propolis cancer. The manual search was carried out in May 2025, considering publications between the years 2020 and 2025. Fourteen articles were identified, of which two were excluded for not addressing cancer or Brazilian propolis. Of the twelve included articles, all presented in vitro studies, two of which used nanoparticles, and one also conducted in vivo tests with mice. Two studies addressed lung cancer cells: one demonstrated significant therapeutic effects, while the other did not show relevant results. One article investigated head and neck cancer stem cells, showing a reduction in their proportion. Promising results were observed in studies involving breast cancer cells (3), ovarian (3), liver (1), prostate (1), and melanoma (1). One study also demonstrated inhibition of colon cancer cells using a combination of red, brown and green propolis. Some articles reported enhanced efficacy of chemoterapia tratamentos when combined with red propolis. Its bioactive compounds also demonstrated properties that contribute to promoção da saúde and education, as well as disease prevenção, by strengthening the immune system and exhibiting antifungal, antimicrobial, antibacterial, antiparasitic, antiplasmodial, antitumor, antioxidant and immunomodulatory activities. These effects indicate potential therapeutic applications in inflammatory, infectious and oncological diseases. The data reinforce the relevance of red propolis as a promising natural resource with potential to investigate possibilities in the tratamento of various types of cancer. However, more controlled and randomized ensaio clínicos in humans are still needed, along with deeper investigations into its mechanisms of action and potential therapeutic applications. This study contributes to the appreciation of Brazilian traditional medicine and its integration into innovative therapeutic strategies, applicable to different complex medical systems, for the benefit of global health.",

    "abstract": "Acupuncture, an integral part of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), has more than 3000 years of history and has gained global recognition, being used by more than 80% of the world's population. Its integration into conventional medicine has been supported by the WHO, especially since the Traditional Medicine Strategy 2014-2023 (extended to 2025) and the Astana Declaration. In this context, the study explores the incorporation of acupuntura in conventional health centers, with emphasis on the experience of the Red de Salud UC CHRISTUS in Chile. The research employed a descriptive review of scientific literature in PubMed and Scopus, as well as institutional web sources. It was complemented with data obtained from health professionals and patient surveys in the UC CHRISTUS Network, describing the integration process, its benefits and challenges. Results Globally, the push for traditional medicine has been reflected in initiatives such as the WHO Global Center for Traditional Medicine and the inclusion of TCM in ICD-11. In the USA, the opioid crisis prompted the inclusion of acupuntura as a therapeutic alternative, with Medicare coverage from 2020. Europe also shows progress: in countries such as Norway and Denmark, a significant portion of hospitals offer acupuntura. In Chile, acupuntura was regulated in 2006 and has since increased its presence, with more than 1800 registered practitioners in 2024 and FONASA coverage in certain pathologies. A new Complementary Medicine Policy was published in 2024 to fully integrate it into the national system. Benefits of integration For patients, integration improves access, promotes reliable therapeutic options and facilitates tratamento continuity. Therapists gain access to institutional support and clinical segurança. Institutions, in turn, improve satisfação do paciente, reduce drug use and optimize cost-efetividade. Desafios identified There are regulatory, financial and communication barriers. Some techniques such as moxibustion are limited in hospital settings. In addition, the need to use conventional medical language and share clinical records represents a challenge for acupuncturists. There are also financial constraints and lack of comprehensive coverage. Discussion Integration in health systems such as the United Kingdom or Norway has been successful. In Chile, the particular case of its implementation in the Red de Salud UC CHRISTUS is presented, with almost 300 outpatient attentions performed to date with excellent results in patient surveys and with a project to be implemented in the near future to attend hospitalized patients. The integrative approach not only improves patient well-being, but also collaboration between medical disciplines. Limitations The review was limited by the number of databases used, the lack of structured quality assessment of studies, and the absence of quantitative analysis. Acupuncture can be an effective tool for strengthening integrative health systems. The experience at UC CHRISTUS reflects its potential, although challenges remain in access, economic evaluation, and communication that must be addressed to achieve sustainable integration.",

There is a prevailing negative attitude towards fever, which persists despite the evidence of beneficial immunological effects and lack of practical implementation of this knowledge among both healthcare professionals and the lay public. It results in overuse of healthcare providers, medication as antibiotics and antipyretics as a burden for the healthcare sector. After it`s implementation, the efetividade of the FeverFriend Program was investigated in promoting behavioral change in fever management. The FeverFriend Program includes a decision aid with risk assesment based on a complex algorithm. This unique algorithm was based on the NICE quidelines adapted to local properties by an expert group, resulting in a standard RAG triage and behavioral advice. The App is connected to a knowledge base. Both are free available. A prospective, observational registry study was conducted within a mobile app with self-selected users. Patient`s and caregiver`s anonymized in-app data of a 42-month period (12/2020-05/2024) were analyzed. The FeverFriend app incorporates four different observational units. Users, patients level including baseline characteristics, fever measurement and result level, closing with illness review. Results: Among 21,137 Hungarian users following app use, the results indicated that all three hypotheses remained statistically significant (p > 0.01). Overall, our analysis (McNemar's test) provides robust evidence for the significant changes observed in the use of antibiotics, antipyretics and doctor visits due to fever, even after considering multiple testing adjustments. Discussion: Sociological research attributes parental attitudes to feverish pediatric illnesses to a number of factors such as unjustified fear, help-seeking behavior, complex behavioral patterns of symptom avoidance and comfort-seeking. In the light of recent research, the target points of improvement in attitudes are linked to healthcare literacy among health professionals and lay people. In our program self-reporting EMA, real time and real-life circumstances were captured. The good coverage of our data observed in key sociodemographic and anthropometric measures provides confidence in the validity of our findings and their applicability to the broader population of small children. After rigorous risk assessment, it has been found that most cases of childhood febrile illnesses can be managed with a delayed or no prescription strategy for antibiotics, resulting in satisfactory patient resultados and uncomplicated clinical courses. The FeverFriend Program, as a best practice example of evidence based integrative approaches is available in 9 languages worldwide. It proves to be a safe and effective tool for promoting behavior change in fever management among the nonrandomized population of caregivers of children. These findings contributed to a new Guideline on Management of Childhood Fever in Hungary released in March 2025, implementing the added value of integrative approaches into the existing healthcare system.",

    "abstract": "This work proposes a reflection grounded in Afro-diasporic perspectives, aiming to explore the terreiro and the life experiences of Black youth. The study draws on the principle of Kalunga, as presented by Fu-Kiau (2024). Kalunga is understood as the vital Force (Nguzo, Ntu, Axé) that not only constitutes human beings but also shapes the world in its entirety. Nature, animals, the sea, and the universe are all expressions of this forceeach being a particle of Kalunga (Fu-Kiau, 2024). Terreiros, in turn, are understood as spaces of care, healing, and belonging, especially for Black youth who find in them a place for subjective reconstruction through ancestral physical and spiritual practices. This work is thus anchored in the cosmoperceptions present in African-based religions, which structure practices, ways of acting, and modes of relating to the world, in order to understand the objective effects of these terreiro-based practices. Within this context, practices such as herbal baths, psychological support, and ebósworks performed with natural elements like grains, candles, and eggsare recognized as unique forms of care, grounded in the notion of Kalunga and embodied within terreiro spaces. The methodology of our research is grounded in aterrada research. This approach is described in two key references: the book Saberes Plurais e Epistemologias Aterradas (2020) and the article A Pesquisa no Kitembo  pistas para a construção de uma psicologia aterrada (2018). These works outline a methodological framework that seeks to recognize religious leaders as references and co-authors within the research process. Data collection within this methodology involves presenting knowledge derived from lived experiences  particularly the wisdom of the terreiro  emphasizing its authorship and protagonism. In this sense, the teachings conveyed within the terreiro space by the Nganga (masters and spiritual leaders of the terreiro) serve as central references that contribute to the construction of the research. In this setting, the figure of the Pomba-Gira emerges as an entity of crossroads and pathways, a producer of both physical and existential movements. Her manifestations occur in dynamic interaction with this vital force, as she herself is an expression of Kalungaa promoter of care and guidance. Therefore, this work advocates for the recognition of Afro-diasporic epistemo.logies as legitimate producers of care and as foundations for alternative modes of existence and healing. By valuing these experiences, the study moves away from the model colonial and pathologizing interpretations, opening space for the sensitive listening of Afro-Brazilian expressions of life and culture and affirming their political, subjective, and physical power, particularly in the lives of terreiro black Youth.",

    "abstract": "Racism has historically and persistently influenced the constitution of Brazilian subjectivities, shaping pedagogical, therapeutic, and scientific practices. This process imposes a universalized worldview that excludes traditional Afro-Indigenous knowledge and cosmoperceptions from the frameworks of healthcare. This article aims to challenge that paradigm by presenting Afro-Indigenous traditional knowledge as epistemological and methodological foundations of care within Brazils Primary Health Care, based on a lived experience in a Family Clinic in the city of Rio de Janeiro. Grounded in Afro-Indigenous epistemologies and drawing on the practices of psychologia enramada (Santos, 2023), escrevivência (Evaristo, 2020), and psicologia afropindorâmica, the work is rooted in sensitive listening and attention to ancestral ways of life, seeking to integrate spirituality, memory, and care as core principles of integral health. The methodology is anchored in the principles of research aterrada (grounded research) and escrevivência, considering the daily life of favelas, villages, terreiros, and quilombos as loci of knowledge production. Within this context, the article shows how historically marginalized Afro-diasporic knowledge continues to live on through community practices and spiritual experiences of the Black Indigenous Brazilian populationeven within saúde pública institutions. Based on the account of a clinical casethe arrival of a Black woman at a health unit, bringing with her the knowledge of Maria Mulambo da Kalûnga (Costa, Santos & Oliveira, 2025)this text highlights the ways in which entities from Afro-Brazilian cosmology, such as the Pombagiras, are present in the lives of those receiving care, acting as forces of subjective and political reorganization of a lifestyle common within Brazilian territories. The text draws on the authors' Brazilian-lived experience (Evaristo, 2020) as psychologists working in public healthcare, along with the theoretical contributions of Black and Indigenous intellectuals. Engaging in dialogue with both scholars and concrete scenes of care in territories marked by resistance and reexistence, the article proposes a territory-listening approach that centers diasporic epistemologies as vital to the reinvention of care. The Black bodies that now traverse universities and care systems carry with them memories of knowledge that defy Eurocentric clinical logic and offer concrete alternatives for promoting bem viver (good living) in saúde pública. Thus, this article argues that healthcare in Brazil must be radically expanded and reconfigured through the lens of Black Indigenous epistemologies. Within this horizon, afropindorâmica psychology emerges as a concrete possibility for reparative, re-enchanted, and collective healing.",

    "abstract": "Ayahuasca is a psychoactive beverage traditionally used by indigenous peoples of the Amazon for ritualistic, spiritual, and healing purposes. In recent decades, there has been a growing scientific interest in investigating its potential therapeutic effects and mechanisms of action. This evidence map aims to: Map the extent, nature and distribution of research on ayahuasca; Identify the main areas of research related to ayahuasca (e.g., mental health, addiction, spiritual well-being, neuroscience); Characterize the types of studies conducted (e.g., randomized controlled trials, observational studies, revisão sistemáticas, qualitativo studies, neuroimaging); Identify gaps in research and promising areas for future research; List existing revisão sistemáticas and meta-analyses on the topic. This is an Evidence Map protocol based on revisão sistemáticas that will characterize existing research on ayahuasca and the resultados related to health and well-being. The search will be conducted in the following electronic databases: PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, Web of Science, PsycINFO, LILACS, and Google Scholar (to include gray literature). Terms such as ayahuasca, DMT, hoasca, psychedelics, and their synonyms will be used. Studies with human subjects of different designs will be included as ensaio clínicos, observational studies, qualitativo studies, neuroimaging studies, revisão sistemáticas, and meta-analyses. The selection of studies will be made by two independent reviewers. Disagreements will be resolved by consensus. A standardized data extraction form will be used to collect relevant information from each included study, including: Study characteristics (design, sample size, population studied, context), Intervention (ayahuasca composition, dosage, frequency of use), Comparator (if applicable), Primary and secondary resultados assessed, Main results, Assessment of methodological quality (using appropriate tools for each type of study, such as the Jadad scale for ensaio clínicos or the CASP tool for qualitativo studies), and Information on segurança and adverse events. The extracted data will be synthesized in a narrative format and presented in tables and graphs to provide an overview of the research landscape. The evidence map will describe: 1) number of studies identified and included by area of investigation and type of study, 2) geographic distribution of the studies, 3) most studied populations and existing gaps, 4) The main resultados investigated and the overall results found, and 5) overall methodological quality of the included studies. The evidence map will contribute to systematizing scientific knowledge about the effects of Ayahuasca on health and well-being, identifying gaps and opportunities for users, professionals, policy makers, and researchers.",

Treatment options include western medicine, acupotomy a minimally invasive procedure using a needle with a blade-like tip and a combination of both. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of these three tratamento strategies on qualidade de vida and productivity loss in patients with LR. This randomized, controlled, multicenter pilot trial enrolled patients diagnosed with LR and a Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) pain score greater than 4. Participants were randomly assigned to three groups (n=20 per group): (1) usual Western medicine, (2) deeply inserted acupotomy targeting Hyeopcheok points, or (3) a combination of both tratamentos. Over a 7-week period, intervençãos were administered twice weekly for three weeks, followed by two post-tratamento follow-up visits within the subsequent four weeks. The 5-level EuroQol 5-Dimension questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L) was used to assess qualidade de vida (QoL). Productivity loss was measured using iMTA Productivity Cost questionnaire (iPCQ), which captures absenteeism, presenteeism, and unpaid work. Outcomes were assessed at four time points over 7 weeks. Between group comparisons were conducted using analysis of covariance, adjusting for baseline values. Among the 60 patients, the mean age was 53 years and 45% were male. The mean EQ-5D-5L scores at baseline were 0.75, 0.70, and 0.73 for the western medicine, acupotomy, and combination groups respectively. After tratamento, the scores increased to 0.79 in both western medicine and acupotomy groups, and 0.75 in the combination group. However, no significant differences were observed among the groups (p=0.14). In terms of productivity loss, absenteeism was reported in only one patient in the acupotomy group. The western medicine group reported the lowest level of presenteeism (236.13 hours), while the combination tratamento group demonstrated the least productivity loss in unpaid work (138 hours). Total productivity loss costs were lowest in the combination group ($114.12), compared to the acupotomy group ($200.82), western medicine group ($181.24), with no significant differences (p=0.69). Although differences in QoL and productivity loss were not significant, the combination of pharmacologic and deeply inserted acupotomy terapia demonstrated potential in reducing productivity-related burden.",

    "abstract": "Urbanization has led to decreased exposure to natural environments, while the prevalence of childhood and adolescent obesity continues to rise globally. Evidence suggests that green spaces may play a protective role against adiposity by promoting physical activity, reducing stress, and enhancing environmental quality. This study aimed to investigate the association between exposure to urban green spaces and adiposity among adolescents participating in a Brazilian birth cohort. We conducted a cross-sectional analysis within a cohort study using data from 2,446 adolescents (mean age 11.6 years) enrolled in the Ribeirão Preto BRISA cohort. Green space exposure was quantified using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Percentage of Vegetation Cover (PVC), calculated from satellite imagery (CBERS-4A) and geospatial analysis within 300 m and 500 m radii of the participants residences. Body fat percentage was measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Generalized linear models were used to estimate associations between vegetation metrics and adiposity, adjusting for socioeconomic class (Critério Brasil - CCEB) and physical activity (assessed using the PAQ-C questionnaire). Analyses were performed using StataSE 14.0, with a significance level set at 5%. A consistent inverse association was found between proximity to green spaces and body fat percentage. After adjustments, a higher NDVI at 300 m was associated with lower adiposity ( = 11.10; 95% CI: 17.20 to 5.10; p < 0.001), and similar associations were observed for NDVI at 500 m and PVC in both radii. Surprisingly, adolescents from lower socioeconomic classes (D/E) had lower adiposity compared to higher-income groups, potentially reflecting contextual factors such as increased non-recreational physical activity or food insecurity. This study highlights the independent role of urban vegetation in reducing adolescent adiposity, suggesting that integrating green infrastructure into urban planning may contribute to the prevenção of obesity and promote health equity. Findings support multisectoral policies that prioritize equitable access to green spaces as part of planetary health strategies.",

This study aimed to investigate the association between residential green space exposure and the prevalence of asthma in adolescents participating in the BRISA birth cohort in Ribeirão Preto, São Paulo, Brazil. This observational study was based on data from the Ribeirão Preto branch of the BRISA cohort. Exposure to green areas was assessed using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the percentage of vegetation cover (PVC) derived from satellite imagery (CBERS-4A). Spatial buffers of 300 m and 500 m were generated around geocoded residential addresses. Asthma was identified through the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) questionnaire and/or spirometry results. Log-binomial regression models were employed to estimate associations between green exposure and asthma prevalence, adjusting for socioeconomic class (Critério Brasil - CCEB). Analyses were performed using StataSE 14.0, with a significance level set at 5%. Out of 8,321 live births initially enrolled, 2,874 adolescents (mean age 11.6 years) completed the ISAAC questionnaire, and 1,824 had spirometry. The prevalence of asthma in adolescence was 35.5% (ISAAC), 36.7% (spirometry), and 13.8% when both criteria were combined. NDVI and PVC were significantly and inversely associated with asthma prevalence (using both criteria), regardless of socioeconomic conditions [NDVI 300 m: adjusted prevalence ratio (aPR) 0.11, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.02; 0.70, p=0.019  NDVI 500 m: aPR 0.15, 95%CI 0.03;0.80, p=0.026  PCV 300 m: aPR 0.34, 95%CI 0.12; 0.93, p=0.035  PCV 500 m: aPR 0.40, 95%CI 0.16; 1.03, p=0.058]. Greater residential exposure to urban green spaces was associated with a lower prevalence of asthma in adolescents. However, green areas remain limited and unevenly distributed in Ribeirão Preto, favoring more affluent districts. These findings underscore the importance of public policies that promote environmental equity and enhance access to healthy urban environments.",

    "abstract": "The Amazon basin represents the largest source of free-flowing fresh water on the planet. Nonetheless, the human inhabitants of Amazonia suffer disproportionately from health problems associated with inadequate access to clean water and sanitation. For indigenous populations, the situation is even more precarious: poor sanitary conditions contribute to persistently high rates of intestinal parasitism, anemia and malnutrition among indigenous peoples across the Amazon. Climate change is now exacerbating existing problems. For these reasons, achieving UN Global Development Goals, especially GDS-6 relating to water and sanitation, has proven exceptionally challenging among indigenous Amazonian peoples. Even where government WASH investments have reached rural parts of Amazonia, the technologies used are often inappropriate, follow-up and monitoring is minimal to non-existent, and corruption is rampant, leading to a widespread pattern of failed investments, abandoned infrastructure and community cynicism. This presentation summarizes original research on an innovative program of WASH programing carried out by the charity organization Rainforest Flow (rainforestflow.org) in dialog with traditional medical, spiritual and artistic practices. This study included a mixture of ethnographic observation of water use and hygienic practices in different indigenous communities before and after implementation of water and sanitation programs, as well as health baseline and follow-up studies: (1) Results of qualitativo social-sanitary questionnaires were analyzed to characterize the prevailing social, hygienic and sanitary conditions and practices in project communities before intervençãos were planned; (2) Free-listing activities were carried out regarding illness vocabulary, concepts of health and well-being, childcare practices and diet to characterize indigenous categories and concepts regarding health, water and sanitaiton; (3) Ethnographic observations of water use, sanitary practices, health and dietary practices, and informal interviews concerning community history, local health concepts, diet, water use practices and other topics; (3) Microbiological analysis of samples taken from different surface water sources in the community; (4) Baseline health study by a health team based at Cayetano Heredia University in Peru including: biometric monitoring of nutritional status, microbiological diagnosis of intestinal parasite prevalence, blood hemoglobin analysis studies, and systematic health interviews, followed by follow-up studies to measure health impacts. Slow-sand filtration technologies implemented as much as 20 years ago have managed to achieve social sustainability and lasting health benefits in the study communities. Health resultados includes a sustained up to 93% reduction in the prevalence of diarrheal diseases over baseline values, a 74% reduction in mortality caused by diarrheal diseases, significant reduction in many intestinal parasites, and decreasing prevalence of anemia in the populations benefited by this program. However, these aims were not achieved solely by technological intervençãos alone. The project involved a careful consideration of traditional concepts around water, water-borne diseases and gastrointestinal illness categories. By leveraging traditional concepts about water contamination, educational and hygiene-related activities were targeted to better achieve positive resultados. Global WASH intervençãos have focused on infrastructure, with not enough emphasis on social adaptation of these technologies, nor on long-term monitoring of resultados. This innovative project has used low-tech solutions in dialog with medical anthropology to achieve sustained health benefits for indigenous communities of Amazonia.",

    "abstract": "People around the world are living longer, and this has led to specific challenges related to healthcare. Traditional, Complementary, and Integrative Medicine (TCIM) promotes comprehensive care focused on the elderly, as well as positive effects on health and well-being. The Mega-map is an evidence map with a broader scope, encompassing only revisão sistemáticas and other evidence maps. This mega-map aims to 1) identify, systematize, and characterize revisão sistemáticas on TCIM for the elderly, 2) identify, extract, and present evidence maps of TCIM for the elderly, and 3) describe the effects of intervençãos, adverse events, and knowledge gaps. This is a protocol for an evidence mega-map on TCIM for elderly healthcare. The search will be conducted in seven databases (PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, Scopus, Web of Science, PsychInfo, and BVS) in English, Spanish, and Portuguese. Only revisão sistemáticas of randomized ensaio clínicos on acupuntura, acupressure, auriculoterapia, tai chi, qi gong, meditação, yoga, dance terapia, music terapia, reflexology, art terapia, shiatsu, and balneoterapia will be included. The evidence maps will be selected from the Brazilian Academic Consortium for Integrative Health database and will be on aromaterapia, cupping terapia, moxibustion, apiterapia, anthroposophic medicine, Ayurveda, and medicinal cannabis. We will use the Rayyan platform with two blinded reviewers to select the articles. Disagreements will be resolved by consensus. We will develop a matrix Excel characterization to synthesize the findings. The AMSTAR 2 will be applied to assess the methodological quality of the revisão sistemáticas. The Tableau platform will be used to graphically present the results, which will be aggregated by the number of revisão sistemáticas and evidence maps, confidence level of the reviews, effects, and health resultados. The data will be presented through a narrative synthesis, and the method and results will be displayed following the PRISMA and the Campbell Collaboration evidence and gap map guidelines. TCIM can contribute to expanded, continuous care, centered on the person and their health needs. Evidence mega-maps have been a strategic and innovative method that facilitates the visualization of evidence by professionals, patients, and policymakers in a given area of knowledge. The synthesis of the TCIM efetividade mega-map will serve to encourage decision-making on healthcare for the elderly, in order to foster action for the Decade of Healthy Ageing 20212030 and the Global Strategy for Traditional, Complementary and Integrative Medicine 20252034.",

    "abstract": "Homeopathy, situated within the broader framework of Traditional, Complementary, and Integrative Healthcare (TCIH), represents an ecological and systemic therapeutic modality oriented toward the restoration and maintenance of health across all living systems. Grounded in principles that emphasize the interdependence of human, animal, and environmental health, Homeopathy inherently aligns with several of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This review seeks to critically examine Homeopathys potential contributions to sustainable development, emphasizing its ecological attributes and systemic therapeutic approach. A narrative review was undertaken using a combination of keywords into three main categories: Homeopathy, Sustainability and related concepts (One Health, agrohomeopatia, cost-efetividade, antimicrobial resistance) . Basic and clinical research on plants, animals, humans and economic studies was identified through systematic searches of electronic databases including AMED, Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, SCOPUS. The analytical framework was structured around ecological and environmental, social-economical, and person-centered dimensions. Homeopathy operates as a low-impact, resource-efficient therapeutic system with applications across human, veterinary, and agricultural contexts. In the European Union, it is officially regulated as a therapeutic option within organic farming, reflecting its ecological compatibility. A prominent example is the development of homeopatia in agriculture, which applies homeopathic principles to plant health management, demonstrating potential for promoting sustainable, pesticide-free agriculture with improved crop resilience and productivity. From an ecological perspective, homeopatia is characterized by minimal material consumption, low residual environmental impact, and non-toxic preparation processes. Its medicines, prepared through serial dilution and succussion, require negligible quantities of physical substances, resulting in limited waste generation and reduced ecological burden. Furthermore, the decentralized and small-scale nature of homeopathic medicine production offers opportunities for energy conservation and the reinforcement of local economies. At a systemic level, homeopatia embodies a holistic model of care, addressing physical, mental, emotional, and environmental determinants of health. Its integrative approach complements the One Health paradigm by recognizing the interconnectedness of human, animal, and ecosystem health, thereby contributing to planetary wellbeing. Notably, homeopatia has shown potential in mitigating eco-toxicity, promoting detoxification in human, animal, and plant systems, and supporting the recovery of ecological balance following environmental disturbances. Homeopathys systemic utility extends to contemporary saúde pública challenges, including antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and the risks of polypharmacy. As a non-toxic, adjunctive terapia, it offers potential to reduce reliance on pharmaceuticals and mitigate adverse drug effects, particularly in fields such as Integrative Oncology, where it is employed to alleviate the side effects of conventional cancer tratamentos. Additionally, homeopatia contributes to the social dimension of sustainable development through its emphasis on patient empowerment, holistic mental and emotional healthcare, and cost-effective service delivery. Emerging evidence indicates high levels of user satisfaction and economic efficiency associated with homeopathic care. Positioned within the TCIH framework, homeopatia offers a distinct ecological and systemic therapeutic paradigm with potential contributions to sustainable development. Its low environmental footprint, resource-efficient methodologies, and holistic health model align with contemporary ecological and saúde pública priorities. However, further empirical research is required to substantiate and operationalize its role within sustainable healthcare systems and broader ecological health initiatives.",

    "abstract": "The use of Alternative and Complementary Medicines and Therapies (CAM), such as Traditional Chinese Medicine, Homeopathy, and Neural Therapy, has shown sustained growth worldwide. In Colombia, although these practices are authorized within the General System of Social Security in Health (SGSSS), a lack of detailed data on their users limits informed decision-making, strategic planning, and the design of integrative care models. This study aimed to characterize the profile of users within the contributory regime who accessed CAM services between 2011 and 2019, and to identify usage patterns and regional distribution of service availability. This is a retrospective, quantitative, cross-sectional observational study. It included users from the contributory regime of the SGSSS who accessed CAM services from 2011 to 2019. Main data sources were official administrative databases: BDUA, SISPRO, and the UPC calculation database. CAM services were identified using active CUPS codes. Sociodemographic, clinical (Charlson Comorbidity Index), and utilization variables were analyzed. Data were processed using Stata 17. Data from 234,843 users were analyzed. Women represented 66% of users, and the average age increased from 42.7 years in 2011 to 54 years in 2019. Most users were at low risk of mortality (Charlson 02). Nonetheless, 14.9% had diabetes, 9.9% chronic pulmonary disease, and 8.2% cancer, suggesting that CAM is sought by patients with complex chronic conditions. Geographically, 65% of demand was concentrated in Bogotá, Cundinamarca, Antioquia, and Santander. Only 16 out of 39 health insurers (EPS) in the contributory regime reported CAM services, with one EPS accounting for 46% of all cases, indicating a high concentration in service provision. Despite being part of the official benefits plan, overall utilization remained low (<0.005). A high frequency of generic CUPS codes was observed, limiting the precise characterization of the therapies actually provided. The study reveals low reported use and uneven distribution of CAM services within Colombia's contributory health regime, with marked disparities by region and insurer. The overuse of generic procedure codes hinders traceability and limits the ability to assess the type and impact of specific therapies. It is essential to improve standardization and training in CAM coding and recording practices. The adoption of CIE-11, specifically Chapter 26 on traditional medicine conditions, presents an opportunity to enhance the visibility and regulation of CAM services. To optimize the integration of CAM within health systems, it is critical to strengthen provider training, ensure better data quality, and promote equitable access. CAM could play a more relevant role in managing chronic and complex conditions when adequately recorded and integrated into person-centered care models. This evidence supports the development of targeted saúde pública strategies and the improvement of integrative service delivery models across Colombia.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the efetividade and segurança of pediatric Tui Na on childrens growth We conducted a literature search in Chinese and English databases, including CNKI, Wanfang, VIP, SinoMed, PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, Clinical Trials, WHO ICTRP ensaio clínico registration platforms on June 8, 2024, and search for randomized controlled trialsRCTs on pediatric Tui Na, to assess the impact of Tui Na lasting over 3 months on childrens growth. A total of 46 trials published in Chinese involving 11,287 children aged 0-13 years were all conducted in China. We found that Tui Na increased height comparing to routine healthcare alone (29 trials, mean 3.68 cm, 95% CI (confidence interval) [2.92, 4.43], low-quality evidence) and to touch (2 trials, mean 1.72 cm, 95% CI [1.22, 2.22], low-quality evidence). Adding Tui Na to touch resulted in a height increase of 1.99 cm (5 trials, mean 95% CI [1.04, 2.95], low-quality evidence). Subgroups of normal children (Tui Na for 3-4 months, 5-6 months, 12 months) and preterm children (Tui Na for 3-4 months, 12 months) both showed significant benefits. Tui Na was also beneficial for the growth of height, weight, head circumference, chest circumference, waist circumference and BMI, as well as parental satisfaction comparing to routine healthcare. Comparing to touch, Tui Na was beneficial for growth of height, weight and head circumference. Tui Na also showed additional benefits in growth of height, weight and head circumference added to touch. In most subgroups, we consistently found benefits across different Tui Na time ranges. Tui Nas effects are clearer among normal children when applied for 3 months rather than preterm infants. The overall risk of bias of the included trials was unclear or high. The main issues were insufficient reporting on randomization, allocation concealment, resultado assessor blinding, and incomplete resultado reporting. Our study also addressed the overall response rate, the segurança of the intervenção, and the satisfaction of children/parents, limited evidence was found. This evaluation indicates that Tui Na over 3 months can promote childrens growth and appears to be safe, with high parental satisfaction. It may have a significant benefits on normal childrens growth, for preterm infants, long-term Tui Na may be required. However, large-sample and high-quality RCTs and real-world observations with long-term follow-up are needed to confirm these findings. Based on the existing evidence, it is recommended to implement Tui Na for 3-6 months or longer, and from the perspective of economics and parent-child relationships, we suggest widely promoting Tui Na in families or communities to maintain health and improve children's growth. For future research, it is recommended that these trials clearly define the age and comorbidities of children in their design. Additionally, they should consider intervençãos with adequate length and the need for a family-based setting. Outcomes related to implementation, such as health economics and child acceptance, should be evaluated. Long-term follow-up is also essential. Large real-world observations with long-term follow up in community settings are also important for clinical reference.",

    "abstract": "Respiratory tract infections (RTIs) are the most frequent reason for prescription if antibiotic due to either primary bacterial etiology or the potential for secondary bacterial involvement. In 2019, RTIs were the leading cause of death from infectious diseases. Preparations from Echinacea species are among the most commonly used phytomedicines for RTIs. We examined whether any preparation from Echinacea ssp. could reduce the need for use of antibiotics by preventing RTIs and their complications, and investigated its segurança profile under conditions of an RCT. Systematic search of databases EMBASE, PubMed, Google Scholar, Cochrane DARE, clinicaltrials.gov. The inclusion criteria were RCTs testing Echinacea preparations for the prevenção or tratamento of RTIs,also reporting on RTI-related complications and/or use of antibiotics. Meta-analytical methods (common and random effect model) were applied to quantify differences in RTI incidence and antibiotic usage between tratamento and control groups. 30 RCTs with 39 comparisons between Echinacea and placebo, resp. other controls and overall 5652 randomized subjects could be retrieved. Echinacea significantly reduced the monthly RTI occurrence (risk ratio RR, common effect model 0.68 (95% CI: 0.610.77) and the number of participants with 1 RTI (RR=0.75 [95% CI 0.690.81]), corresponding to an odds ratio OR=0.53 [95% CI 0.420.67]. It reduced recurrent infections (RR=0.60; 95% CI 0.460.80), RTI complications (RR=0.44; 95% CI 0.360.54), and the need for antibiotic terapia (RR=0.60; 95% CI 0.390.93), with total antibiotic terapia days reduced by 70% (individual risk ratio IRR=0.30; 95% CI: 0.120.73). Alcoholic extracts from freshly harvested Echinacea purpurea showed the strongest effect when reducing AB tratamento days by 80% (IRR 0.21; 95% CI 0.150.29). Adverse events were comparable between Echinacea and control groups (RR =0.99 ; 95% CI 0.931.05). Echinacea preparations appear to be both effective and safe in preventing RTIs and reducing associated complications. In addition, they can contribute to a substantial reduction in the use of antibiotics. Efficacy seems to vary by Echinacea species and preparation method, highlighting the need for product-specific evaluations in future studies.

This study explored parents' understanding and use of antibiotics in the tratamento of children's colds over a decade (2015 and 2025), with the aim of informing baseado em evidence prescribing for the usage as well as knowledge translation of antibiotics for childrens colds. A cross-sectional survey was conducted using an online questionnaire (Wenjuanxing, https://www.wjx.cn) with convenience sampling. We analyzed changes in parental knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding antibiotic use for children's colds between 2015 and 2025, as well as whether they were with medical backgrounds (referring to anything related to medicine, including clinisions, nurses, medical researchers and policy makers) were analyzed. In 2015 and 2025, we collected 556 (valid: 442) and 940 (valid: 870) parent responses (Female respondents accounted for 77.15% and 81.84% ,mainly aged 31-40, 70.36% and 66.21%). The proportion of respondents with medical-related occupations was significantly higher in 2015 (31.22%) than in 2025 (5.98%). By 2025, medical professionals showed improved recognition of common antibiotics, but their ability to correctly identify indications had declined. In contrast, non-medical professionals demonstrated lower antibiotic recognition and indication knowledge than medical professionals, but the proportion of those who recognize antibiotics has increased. In 2025, more non-medical parents indicated strict adherence to doctors' advice, while the proportion administering leftover antibiotics to children without consultation remained unchanged. The proportion of parents obtaining antibiotics through a doctor's prescription increased, while the proportion of parents purchasing antibiotics from pharmacies decreased. In 2025, 3.79% of parents added an online access method. Parents' preference for home-based tratamento of pediatric colds remained stable. However, from 2015 to 2025, the use of non-antibiotic Western medicine and antibiotics at home by parents decreased. Meanwhile, preference for traditional Chinese medicine at home rose. More parents also chose to seek tratamento at hospitals. The proportion of people who prefer to seek tratamento at hospitals has risen, including TCM hospitals, Western medicine hospitals and integrated hospitals. In the choice of TCM for treating colds, both groups of respondents preferred Chinese patent medicine.

    "abstract": "Wind-cold syndrome and wind-heat syndrome are two common patterns of influenza. Early intervenção with traditional Chinese medicine has shown good therapeutic effects. According to the Guidance of diagnosis and tratamento for influenza (Version 2020), Yinqiao San (Lonicera japonica Thunb. and Forsythia suspensa (Thunb.) Vahl Powder) is recommended for the pattern of wind-heat assailing the defense (wei) syndrome, while Jingfang Baidu San (Schizonepeta tenuifolia (Benth.) Briq. and Saposhnikovia divaricata (Turcz.) Schischk. Powder) is recommended for the pattern of wind-cold fettering the exterior (biao) syndrome. This study selected two classic TCM therapeutic methods, pungent-cool exterior-releasing (represented by Yinqiao San) and pungent-warm exterior-releasing (represented by Jingfang Baidu San), as examples to explore the similarities and differences in their modern pharmacological mechanisms in treating influenza, providing a scientific basis for precise clinical medication. The information of the constituent drugs of the two prescriptions was obtained from the Herb 2.0 database. Combined with the influenza-related targets screened from databases such as GeneCards, the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD), and Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM), the common targets and specific targets of Yinqiao San and Jingfang Baidu San in treating influenza were identified. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed using the String database, and the target set was subjected to gene ontology (GO) biological function annotation and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis through the Metascape database to clarify the commonalities and differences in their mechanisms of action. The related pathways of the two prescriptions in treating influenza both involve Oxidative phosphorylation (Energy metabolism), Thermogenesis (Environmental adaptation), and FoxO signaling pathway (Signal transduction), etc. The pathways related to Yinqiao San (pungent-cool exterior-releasing) are mainly enriched in Leukocyte transendothelial migration (Immune system), JAK-STAT signaling pathway (Signal transduction), Th1 and Th2 cell differentiation (Immune system), etc.; the pathways related to Jingfang Baidu San (pungent-warm exterior-releasing) are mainly enriched in Prolactin (PRL) signaling pathway (Endocrine system), ErbB signaling pathway (Signal transduction), and cAMP signaling pathway (Signal transduction) etc. The research results show that both Yinqiao San and Jingfang Baidu San can play an intervenção role in the early stage of influenza by regulating immunity, antiviral activity, and inhibiting inflammation. However, their core mechanisms of action reflect the fundamental differences between the pungent-cool exterior-releasing and pungent-warm exterior-releasing methods in TCM: Yinqiao San (pungent-cool exterior-releasing) focuses on relieving wind-heat and clearing heat-toxicity, with advantages in fine-tuning immune balance (such as leukocyte migration, Th cell differentiation, JAK-STAT signaling). while Jingfang Baidu San (pungent-warm exterior-releasing) focuses on inducing sweating and resolving exterior cold, and exerts its effects by enhancing the bodys stress response (such as prolactin signaling), protecting cardiovascular function, and maintaining energy metabolism (such as cAMP signaling). The significant differences in the pathways of action of the two prescriptions (fine-tuning immune balance vs. enhancing stress metabolism) provide a modern pharmacological basis for the precise differentiation and tratamento of wind-heat invading the defensive qi syndrome and wind-cold binding the exterior syndrome in the early stage of influenza in traditional Chinese medicine.",

    "abstract": "Chronic inflammation is a critical saúde pública concern that, in children and adolescents, increases the long-term risk of a variety of different health issues. While mind-body therapies such as yoga, meditação, and acupuntura have shown promise in modulating immune responses in adults, their segurança and efetividade in pediatric populations remain underexplored. This protocol outlines the methodology for a revisão sistemática and metanálise aimed at evaluating the effects of mind-body therapies on immune modulation in children and adolescents. PROSPERO Registration: CRD42024546585 This revisão sistemática and metanálise will follow PRISMA 2020 reporting guidelines. We will include randomized controlled trials, nonrandomized controlled trials, cohort studies, and case-control studies that examine the relationship between mind-body therapies and immune markers in pediatric populations. Electronic searches will be conducted in MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library, supplemented by trial registries. Risk of bias will be assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool (RoB 1), the Risk of Bias in Non-randomized Studies of Interventions (ROBINS-I), and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS). Two independent reviewers will screen studies, extract data, and assess study quality, with a third reviewer resolving any discrepancies. Results will be synthesized both narratively and through metanálise using R software. We anticipate identifying a growing body of evidence suggesting that mind-body therapies may influence both pro- and anti-inflammatory immune markers in pediatric populations. Based on preliminary screening, it is likely that findings will vary across studies in terms of magnitude and consistency of effects. We also expect to gather data on feasibility, segurança, and dropout rates associated with mind-body therapies in children and adolescents. The review will evaluate the efetividade and segurança of mind-body therapies on immune markers in children and adolescents. The synthesized evidence will guide clinical practice and saúde pública policies in integrating mind-body therapies into pediatric care. The findings will also provide a foundation for future research and policymaking in this area.",

    "abstract": "Depressive and ansiedade symptoms are leading causes of years lived with disability globally. Mindfulness-based intervençãos (MBIs) have proven effective for mild to moderate depressão and ansiedade. However, evidence on their feasibility and efetividade in real-world settings, especially in low- and middle-income countries, remains limited. This study explored the acceptability and feasibility of Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) as an adjunct to usual tratamento in Brazilian Primary Health Care (PHC). This prospective exploratory study is part of a larger doctoral project based on a Stepped Wedge Randomized Clinical Trial (RCT-SW) that compares Mindfulness Based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (MCBT) with usual tratamento in six PHC units managed by OSS Fundação Pio XII. In this pilot study, we specifically evaluated MBCT's feasibility, aiming for a 50% recruitment rate with a qualitativo analysis assessed the intervenção's acceptability. Feasibility was measured by tracking appointments, patient inclusion, and attendance using PHC records. For the qualitativo analysis, semi-structured interviews were conducted with diverse participants, audio-recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using Bardin's thematic content analysis framework. Of 340 patients screened from atenção primária for mild to moderate ansiedade and depressão, 239 (70.2%) met inclusion criteria. Of these, 127 (53.1%) attended the first atenção plena session, and 119 (49.7%) attended at least 4 of the 8 protocol sessions. These figures indicate reasonable recruitment and adherence, suggesting MBCT's viability in PHC. Qualitative analysis of 15 participant interviews revealed three main categories: 1. Conceptions about Integrative Practices (PICS): Most participants had limited prior knowledge of integrative practices, often associating yoga or meditação with relaxation rather than therapeutic applications. This highlights the need for more education on these practices' potential. 2. Coping with Difficult Situations: Participants often used personal coping strategies like social isolation or distraction, typically without formal guidance. MBCT helped fill this gap, with participants reporting significant positive changes in emotional regulation, well-being, and daily engagement. 3. Barriers to Implementation: Logistical issues like inconvenient schedules and transportation, along with a desire for more frequent and longer sessions, were key barriers. Participants also expressed a need for more opportunities to share and deepen their practice. Findings suggest MBCT is feasible and well-received in atenção primária, despite logistical and structural challenges. While nearly half of patients attended at least half of the sessions, adherence was impacted by schedule conflicts, transportation, and session formats. The lack of prior knowledge about integrative practices underscores the need for ongoing health education. These results emphasize integrating such practices more effectively into atenção primária through structural adjustments, better logistical planning, and continuous health education to enhance accessibility and long-term benefits. The study reinforces the importance of a comprehensive, structured approach to implementing atenção plena-based intervençãos in community health.",

    "abstract": "Hot flashes during mandatory five-year or longer endocrine tratamento in women with hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer can significantly impact qualidade de vida and contribute to tratamento non-adherence, potentially increasing the risk of cancer recurrence and metastasis. Conventional tratamento options for menopausal hot flashes are contraindicated in hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer patients or associated with efeitos adversos. This indicates the need for therapies with fewer side effects to improve tratamento adherence and, consequently, reduce the risk of cancer recurrence. Acupuncture is a holistic regulatory terapia with a history of approx. 3000 years as part of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). Evidence suggests that body acupuntura is an effective and safe tratamento for hot flashes. Auricular acupuntura has demonstrated effects comparable to body acupuntura while offering several advantages, including improved practicality and feasibility in clinical settings. The aim of this ensaio clínico is to analyze the impact of auricular acupuntura on side effects caused by endocrine tratamento, primarily hot flashes in breast cancer survivors. 99 women between 18 and 75 years with non-metastatic breast cancer going through endocrine tratamento and suffering from hot flashes will be enrolled. This three-armed, single-centered randomized and registered ensaio clínico (CT number: NCT06369168) compares two methods of auricular acupuntura with a waitlist-control-group. One intervenção group is treated with balanced auricular acupuntura, which is a semi-standardized method developed by Jan Seeber. The second intervenção group receives auricular acupuntura with the points used in the NADA (National Acupuncture Detoxification Association) protocol, which is standardized and used for patients experiencing stress, trauma and mental illness. The trial includes three questionnaire assessments: a baseline assessment prior to the start of the trial, an endline assessment six weeks after the intervenção has started, and a follow-up assessment three months after the end of the last tratamento. Patients in the tratamento arms receive two auricular acupunturas per week over the course of five weeks, compared to a waitlist control group, with no tratamento during the trial period. The study evaluates primarily hot flashes and, secondarily, assesses additional symptoms caused by endocrine tratamento, including stress perception, psychological effects, insomnia and urogenital symptoms. To date (June 2025), 94 out of 99 participants have been recruited. 45 women have received the intervenção tratamentos until now. Preliminary results of this study will be presented at the congress in Rio de Janeiro in October 2025. Endocrine tratamento can trigger a range of menopausal-like vasovagal symptoms, including insomnia and hot flashes. Based on positive study results on auricular acupuntura in insomnia patients, we anticipate similarly beneficial effects in patients experiencing hot flashes. This would support existing research highlighting the importance of integrating approaches from diverse healing traditions to optimize holistic tratamento of cancer patients. If the results of the study confirm our assumptions based on the current state of research, this would strengthen the evidence in Integrative Oncology and suggest a broader clinical application of acupuntura as a complementary breast cancer patient tratamento.

    "abstract": "Yoga terapia is increasingly integrated into clinical care pathways as a complementary intervenção for various health conditions. Professional definitions are essential in the United States and other regulated healthcare environments to guide certification, scope of practice, and research. The International Association of Yoga Therapists (IAYT) provides the only globally available consensus definition of yoga terapia, developed to support integration into healthcare systems that require clearly defined intervençãos and baseado em evidence protocols. However, yoga terapia is practiced and studied globally, often through cultural frameworks that do not align with Western healthcare structures. As U.S.-based researchers, we conducted a scoping review to assess how yoga terapia is described in published primary clinical research and how the practice is defined. We also examined how the description of yoga terapia aligns with the IAYT definition published in 2016. Our goal was not to evaluate diverse practices, but to understand the characteristics of the literature using the term yoga terapia, the context in which the term is used, and how existing literature supports the integration of yoga terapia into healthcare systems that depend on standardized definitions and rigorous evidence. PubMed, Embase, CENTRAL and PEDro were searched in January 2024 for primary studies published since 2016 which included yoga terapia, yoga therapies, yoga therapist or yoga therapists in the title or abstract and which described the results of applying yoga terapia to individuals for improving health. Searches of PubMed, CENTRAL, and PEDro were updated in January 2025. After deduplication, two authors independently screened the title and abstract of each record and then screened the full text of potentially relevant studies. Two authors then independently extracted data on definitions of yoga terapia and descriptions of protocol authorship, practitioner training, and individualized assessments from included studies. All disagreements were resolved by discussion. Searches retrieved a total of 2093 records. After deduplication, 1394 records were screened, 334 studies were assessed in full text, and 180 studies were included. A majority of studies were published by Indian authors (134/180; 74%) and studies were most commonly published in complementary or integrative medicine (including yoga or ayurveda) journals (n=85) followed by specialty journals (n=63). Approximately half of the studies described randomized controlled trials (93/180; 52%). Regardless of geographic origin, most studies (165/180; 85%) did not provide a definition of yoga terapia. Few studies included sufficient information to determine alignment with the IAYT framework. Commonly missing elements included protocol development, practitioner qualifications and certifications, and assessment procedures. This lack of comprehensive reporting limits the strength of evidence in clinical practice guidelines and poses challenges to healthcare integration. The therapeutic value of yoga is not in question. However, more transparent reporting and methodological rigor are needed to support the integration of yoga terapia into healthcare systems that rely on defined standards and evidence grades. This review encourages cultural respect, definitional transparency, and global dialogue to strengthen the integration of yoga terapia into healthcare delivery.",

The starting material was obtained by extracting smoke from each participant's cigarette using the Isomaker® device. M edicines were dispensed in 6CH potency, in tablet form. Patients were instructed to take three tablets in the morning and evening, plus one tablet whenever they felt like smoking. Standard PNCT The smoking cessation protocol also included conventional pharmacoterapia with nicotine patches and bupropion hydrochloride, following PNCT guidelines. Homeopathic intervenção was incorporated into the program from May 15, 2025, with participants receiving individualized follow-up . The initiative is underway in the saúde pública system of the state of Pernambuco. Preliminary results include 100 patients who received a homeopathic medicine made from their own cigarette smoke. In the Family Health Units (USF) located in the city of Recife, 62 patients were treated, distributed as follows: Santa Terezinha Island (11), Guabiraba (06), Jardim São Paulo (17), Santo Amaro 2 (10), Santo Amaro 3 (6) and Chão de Estrela (12). In the city of Camaragibe, 38 patients were treated at the USFs Assa Branca (1), Bairro Novo 1 (12) and Bairro Novo 2 (13), Sala do Servidor (08), Vale das Pedreiras (04). The integration of individualized homeopathic medicines into the PNCT is feasible within the saúde pública system and well accepted by participants. Preliminary observations suggest potential benefits in smoking reduction; however, further analysis is required to confirm efficacy and long-term resultados.",

    "abstract": "This work aims to promote constitutive elements for a process of decolonization of health, based on a decolonial confluence of the concept of planetary health. To carry out this journey, we will list conceptual aspects through the Wisdom of Care of the Indigenous Peoples of the Earth, and specifically supported by the notion of \"Teko Porã\", or Well-Being, present in the Guarani people, which expresses a worldview that guides the lifestyle of the people, seeking balance and harmony among beings, having as an interdependent value respect for Nature. This confluence with indigenous knowledge will be methodologically supported in dialogue with Environmental Psychology, mainly through the concepts of lifestyle, spirituality, awareness and qualidade de vida. The research is framed as a theoretical approach and descriptive objective, having as its procedure the carrying out of a bibliographical survey. The focus of the work aims to examine how the conceptualization of the notions of health and disease provides us with historical understandings of human and planetary illness and, consequently, forms of care and understanding of the processes of illness. The chosen methodological path will be the articulation of Planetary Health, Environmental Psychology and the decolonial knowledge of the Original Peoples of the Earth. Through this methodological confluence, we intend to show how environmental psychology and planetary health methodologies can dialogue with decolonial studies for the comprehensive development of climate change and contemporary pathologies from the same vital nexus. From a movement of decolonization of health, an ecological, integrative and inter-relational character of the health-disease process is revealed, and in this sense we can connect the forms of understanding and care of the individual human processes of illness as an epochal trait, where we also open up an understanding that The Fall of the Sky, which represents, according to the Yanomami Shaman Davi Kopenawa, the consummation of the ecological crisis we are going through, is produced by the same vital historical nexus that not only makes humanity collectively ill in the contemporary world, but also other forms of life on Earth. This process of collective illness is driven by the historical participation of human presence in the very way it inhabits the Earth. In view of the process of desertification of the Earth and the collective human and more-than-human illness in the contemporary world, we will trace a vital nexus that connects both processes of illness in the Being-Earth, named as The Fall of the Sky by Davi Kopenawa, and as Cosmophobia by the quilombola master Nego Bispo. Our main challenge is to articulate different areas of knowledge in a way that allows us to access this phenomenon in a multidimensional and holistic way.",

    "abstract": "Cigarette smoking is a leading cause of premature mortality and morbidity in Brazil. This study aimed to develop the hetero-isotherapeutic from cigarette smoke and to investigate the efficacy of homeopathic tratamento for smoking cessation. The double-blind, randomized, controlled ensaio clínico had 84 participants and was approved by Certificate of Ethical Appreciation (CAEE 65622916.2.0000.5257). Two different homeopathic intervençãos were used: Nux vomica (control group) and the individualized homeopathic preparation, heteroisotherapic, which was prepared with the Isomaker® apparatus (tested group). This device allows the extraction of smoke from the participant´s cigarette, which is used as the starting solution for the homeopathic dilution procedure. Nux vomica and heteroisoterapic remedies were randomly offered for 90 days. The Nux vomica group (n=42) and the heteroisoterapic group included smokers (n=42), and the drugs were taken three tablets in the morning and evening and one tablet before each urge to smoke. Inclusion criteria were at least 18 years of age, both sexes, wanting to quit smoking, and participant must be a current smoker, i.e. someone who smokes daily or occasionally. Exclusion criteria were not being a smoker, only being a passive smoker, being an ex-smoker, and being under the age of 18. Participants who were enrolled in the study but refused to respond adequately to the follow-up questionnaire or failed to attend monthly evaluation meetings with the team were also excluded. The primary resultado was tobacco cessation. Secondary resultados were reduction in tobacco dependence and adverse events. There was a between-group difference in tobacco cessation, which was increased (p<0.05) in the hetero-isotherapeutic group (40.0%) compared with the Nux vomica group (21.4%). Thus, the superior efficacy of the individualized hetero-isotherapeutic preparation is demonstrated over the standardized Nux vomica. Both tratamentos decrease the number of cigarettes smoked per day, with a 60.0% reduction in the hetero-isotherapeutic group and 78.6% in the Nux vomica group (p>0.05). In addition, the data showed the absence of adverse events in both groups. The data showed that the homeopathic medicines played a significant role in reducing tobacco dependence in the groups by improving the cessation or reduction in the number of cigarettes smoked. Moreover, these results provide evidence for personalized homeopathic intervençãos in tobacco cessation. They also suggest the need for future placebo-controlled studies to determine the absolute efficacy of these intervençãos compared to conventional tratamentos for tobacco use disorders.",

    "abstract": "Background: Individuals with overweight or obesity experience not only physical, but also psychological, emotional, social problems. More and more integration of clinical practices and health social workers were constructed to improve overall resultados for the patients with overweight problems. The response adaptive randomization (RAR) method adjusts the randomization probability during the trial process, thus more subjects are treated with better therapies and can benefit from the ensaio clínico. This study has been approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of Guanganmen Hospital, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences. Objectives: This study was designed to explore the efetividade of enhanced lifestyle intervenção by health social workers on overweight or obesity using RAR design. In this RAR trial, 34 patients with overweight or obesity were included. During the first stage, 8 participants were randomly assigned to the tratamento or control groups (1:1). At the second stage, every next participant was assigned with the updated allocation proportion determined by the allocation function as the response accumulation. The tratamento group received enhanced lifestyle intervenção by health social workers based on traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) for 12 weeks, while the control group only received TCM terapia. The primary resultado referred to changes in body weight from baseline to 12 weeks post-intervenção, and the proportion of participants achieving over 5% weight reduction was also calculated. Waist-to-hip ratio, blood lipid, blood glucose, uric acid, insulin levels, liver and gallbladder ultrasound, phlegm-heat syndrome scale, psychological resultados and so on were assessed. The segurança resultado included all adverse events occurring in the course of the study. Of 34 patients included in this study, 21 of which were finally assigned to the tratamento group, the remaining 13 were assigned to the control group. Enhanced lifestyle intervenção by health social workers based on TCM terapia for 12 weeks reduced weight significantly (WMD=3.89, SD=5.15; P=0.030), lowered BMI (WMD=1.53, SD=1.75; P=0.016), decreased triglycerides levels (SMD=0.10, SD=0.28; P=0.042), lower phlegm-heat syndrome scores (SMD=3.13, SD=1.93; P=0.004), and relieve ansiedade (P =0.006) compared with the control group. Seven patients (35.0%) in the tratamento group achieved a reduction ratio more than or equal to 5% in weight relative to the baseline level, while there was none in the control group (P=0.026). A subset of the patients in the tratamento group underwent the survey and interview after 12-week tratamento, revealing that it could help learn more about weight management, increase their understanding of obesity and related diseases, enhance their ability of self-management of weight, and put forward that traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) formulations should prioritize portability and appropriate recipe should be provided from patients perspective. Enhanced lifestyle intervenção by health social workers based on TCM terapia could decrease weight, BMI, and triglycerides levels, relieve ansiedade, improve phlegm-heat syndrome scores, and have fewer adverse events, providing clinical evidence for weight management strategies. The RAR method enabled more patients to receive a better tratamento, therefore benefited from a ensaio clínico and met ethical requirement, contributing to the promotion of RAR method.",

    "abstract": "Managing and treating patients with fibromyalgia (FM) is a clinical challenge, as many cases do not respond adequately to conventional therapies. Following the guidelines of the Ministry of Health and scientific evidence recommending the use of non-pharmacological therapies associated with health education, a group terapia protocol called the FloreSer Program was developed. This protocol includes Integrative and Complementary Health Practices (PICS), Social Technologies (TS), and Health Education actions, lasting 12 weeks of weekly face-to-face meetings. In order to understand the perceptions and self-care strategies adopted by women with fibromyalgia after participating in FloreSer, a qualitativo analysis was conducted 9 to 12 months after the end of the first and second editions of the program, through an Integrative Community Therapy (TCI) circle in a new face-to-face meeting. The sample for the qualitativo study consisted of women with fibromyalgia who met again in September 2024 after participating in the first two editions of FloreSer, completed in 2023, in order to evaluate the effects of the program in relation to self-care. The activity was conducted through an Integrative Community Therapy (ICT) circle, with guiding questions, namely: You who take care of everyone, how is your self-care and Did the FloreSER Program help you in your self-care process and in the use of Integrative Health Practices The statements were recorded for later transcription of the content using Microsoft Word and reviewed manually. The analysis followed Bardin's (2011) content analysis technique, organized in three stages: pre-analysis, exploration of the material, and tratamento of the results with inference and interpretation. The event lasted 1 hour and 15 minutes, and the transcript of the content totaled approximately 70 pages. The data obtained were described in four categories: Welcome, Humanization, and Belonging; Self-Care, Supported Self-Care, and PICS; Lifestyle Changes; and Demedicalization. Testimonials that reported the welcome received and the sense of belonging reveal the positive and significant impact of the program. PICS were addressed as active tools in promoting self-care with a fundamental role in reframing illness through practices such as auriculoterapia, foot baths, reiki, and TCI, where they were able to experience, in addition to pain relief, a way of reconnecting with themselves. Self-care emerged not only through the ability to promote and maintain health, but also through a process of conscious decision-making and lifestyle changes. A significant shift toward demedicalization was observed, not only in the cessation of medication use, but also in the adoption of practices such as aromaterapia. The intervençãos proposed by the FloreSER program, using PICS as tools for conscious change, promoted health with self-care as the main pillar. The testimonials highlighted the contribution of reframing care and patient empowerment to physical and emotional well-being, as well as the adoption of healthy lifestyle habits and de-medication.",

    "abstract": "Climate factors are key environmental variables influencing epidemic patterns of infectious diseases. Investigating their correlation with respiratory infectious diseases holds significant value for optimizing routine prevenção strategies. Located in the tropical-subtropical transition zone, Guangdong Province, China, features high temperature, humidity, prolonged rainy seasons, and frequent extreme weather events, providing a unique setting for studying climate-driven epidemic dynamics. This study systematically analyzes correlations between six respiratory infectious diseases and monthly mean temperature, precipitation, and extreme weather events using surveillance data (20232025), aiming to reveal regional climate-disease interaction mechanisms and support climate-sensitive saúde pública early-warning systems. Data were extracted from Guangdong CDCs monthly disease reports (January 2023February 2025) and provincial meteorological records. Statistical analyses (SPSS 26.0) included Pearson correlation for linear associations and Spearmans rank correlation for non-normally distributed data. Six disease incidence rates and three climate indicators were analyzed, with statistical significance set at P<0.05 and effect sizes (correlation coefficients *r*) indicating strength/direction. Preliminary analyses revealed significant climate-disease associations with pathogen-specific response patterns (P<0.05): COVID-19 showed strong positive correlations with mean monthly temperature (*r*=0.66), precipitation (*r*=0.805), and extreme weather events (*r*=0.511), suggesting accelerated transmission under warm, humid, and extreme conditions. Pulmonary tuberculosis correlated positively with precipitation (*r*=0.703), while mumps linked to temperature (*r*=0.594) and precipitation (*r*=0.769), indicating humidity-driven pathogen survival/host behavior changes. Scarlet fever (*r*=0.512) and influenza (*r*=0.555) incidence decreased with rising temperature, potentially due to pathogen suppression or reduced human aggregation. Pearson analysis further validated robustness: COVID-19 maintained positive correlations (temperature: *r*=0.453; precipitation: *r*=0.6025; extreme events: *r*=0.5236); tuberculosis exhibited dual positive correlations (temperature: *r*=0.7084; precipitation: *r*=0.6694); mumps demonstrated strong temperature (*r*=0.7383) and precipitation (*r*=0.7083) synergism. Notably, divergent pathogen responses (e.g., temperature promoting COVID-19 but suppressing influenza) highlighted climate sensitivity variations. Major respiratory infectious diseases in Guangdong exhibit significant climate sensitivity with pathogen-specific response patterns. Public health agencies should integrate climate forecasting to pre-allocate resources during high-risk conditions. Future studies require extended timelines and climate-change scenario modeling to assess long-term epidemic evolution under global warming, informing adaptive saúde pública policies.",

    "abstract": "Allergic diseases are caused by immune dysregulation triggered by allergens. With societal development, high-calorie diets have become one of the causes of allergic diseases. According to traditional Chinese medicine, the Yangming meridian is associated with abundant qi and blood. High-calorie diets can lead to intestinal heat accumulation, resulting in a state of mild intestinal inflammation, which ultimately contributes to the development of allergic diseases. The research team conducted a cross-sectional survey of 442 kindergartens in Longgang District, Shenzhen, involving 120,198 children. The results showed that 47.36% of the children had gastrointestinal heat accumulation. Among the 28,596 children with allergic diseases, 57.98% had gastrointestinal heat accumulation.Based on the TCM theory of the Yangming possessing abundant qi and blood, this study aimed to investigate the intrinsic relationship between allergic diseases and gastrointestinal heat accumulation, providing holistic strategies and methods for their prevenção and tratamento. Study sets \"allergy\" as the keyword, the classic medical records of the \"Ancient and Modern Medical Case Cloud Platform\" were searched, and medical cases containing allergic symptoms were screened, and a total of 497 ancient medical cases and modern famous traditional Chinese medicine medical cases with clear records of allergy-related symptoms (such as nasal discharge and poisoning rash) were included, with a time span from 1808 AD to the present. The thematic analysis method was used to summarize the relationship between Yangming gastrointestinal heat accumulation and allergic manifestations from three aspects: symptoms, symptoms and tratamento. Combine modern research to explain traditional theories. The study found that among the 497 medical cases, heat was the most frequent syndrome, accounting for 16.26% of the total frequency. The results of symptom analysis showed that red tongue was the main symptom of allergic diseases, accounting for 19.32% of the total frequency, and constipation was the primary symptom of fecal symptoms, accounting for 4.43% of the total frequency of symptoms. The analysis of tratamento results showed that the drugs were mainly used to clear heat and detoxify, clear heat and cool blood, accounting for 10.50% and 5.67% of the total frequency, respectively. Yangming gastrointestinal physiology has strong qi and blood, and pathology is very easy to stagnate and turn into heat, forming a state of gastrointestinal heat accumulation. Studies have shown that Yangming is prone to the development of empirical syndrome and heat syndrome is one of the core pathogenesis of allergic diseases, and gastrointestinal heat accumulation is a key link in it. Therefore, harmonizing Yangming qi and blood and clearing gastrointestinal heat accumulation are important tratamentos for the prevenção and tratamento of allergic diseases. The tratamento can use xinyi flowers, nepeta ears, light tempeh and forsythia to clear the heat. Using radish seeds, chicken inner gold to unblock the Yangming stomach and intestines.Dredge the qi machine, clear heat and conduct stagnation, harmonize qi and blood,finally improve the state of gastrointestinal microinflammation, and restore the body's ability to resist evil outside the body, so as to achieve the overall regulation and fundamental tratamento of allergic diseases.",

    "abstract": "Viral pneumonia poses a major threat to global saúde pública, and traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) plays a significant role in its tratamento. It can effectively inhibit viral replication, reduce lung inflammation, and lower the risk of post-infection complications. To fully explore the potential of TCM in treating viral pneumonia, it is necessary to systematically evaluate its historical efficacy and the latest research trends. This study aims to explore the research hotspots and future directions of TCM in the tratamento of viral pneumonia, providing references for relevant researchers. Based on the Web of Science database, this study conducted a bibliometric and visualization analysis of the literature related to TCM in the tratamento of viral pneumonia from 2015 to 2025. The search term was TS=((\"Viral pneumonia\" OR \"Respiratory syncytial virus\" OR \"Influenza virus\" OR \"Rhinovirus\") AND (\"Chinese traditional medicine\" OR \"Traditional Chinese medicine\" OR \"TCM\" OR \"Chinese fitoterapia\")). The VOSviewer (V1.6.20) and CiteSpace (V6.3.R1) visualization tools were used to analyze elements such as countries, institutions, journals, authors, references, and keywords, in order to predict the research trends of TCM in the tratamento of viral pneumonia. A total of 209 English publications were included. From June 2015 to June 2025, the publication rate of literature in this field showed an upward trend, with a particularly rapid increase from 2020 to 2025. China and its TCM universities have made significant progress in this field. The most studied viral pneumonia is caused by influenza and respiratory syncytial virus. The current research hotspots are verifying the effects of TCM in reducing viral replication and inflammatory factor production through in vitro and in vivo experiments. The research trend is shifting from compound TCM preparations to the screening of effective components using network pharmacology and molecular docking techniques, and the targets are moving from inflammatory factors to immune cells. In addition, the development of research on the lung-intestine axis, intestinal flora, and their metabolites provides new ideas for TCM in the tratamento of viral pneumonia and is expected to bring more effective tratamento options. This study comprehensively reviews the research frontiers of TCM in the tratamento of viral pneumonia. In-depth exploration of the role of TCM in the lung-intestine axis may provide valuable references for the scientific research and clinical practice of treating viral pneumonia.",

Convenience sampling was used to recruit 26 subthreshold depressão participants from a university in Beijing using the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) and the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-17). Participants were divided into an expression group (13 participants with negative emotional regulation implicit attitudes) and a control group (13 participants with positive emotional regulation implicit attitudes) based on the Emotional Regulation Implicit Association Test (ER-IAT). and a control group (13 participants with positive implicit attitudes toward emotion regulation). All 26 participants underwent a 3-week intervenção involving four sessions per week of TCM emotional regulation. Statistical analyses were conducted on depressive states and implicit effects of emotion regulation (D values) before and after the TCM emotional regulation intervenção. After the TCM emotional mood induction intervenção, the depressão levels of the 26 participants significantly decreased (t = 6.209, P < 0.001), and the D values improved (t = -2.337, P < 0.05). There was no statistically significant difference in D values before and after intervenção in the control group (P > 0.05), but HAMD-17 scores decreased (t = 3.449, P < 0.05); in the expression group, D values significantly increased after intervenção (t = -6.996, P < 0.001), HAMD-17 scores significantly decreased (t = 5.585, P < 0.001) Traditional Chinese medicine-based emotional regulation induction can enhance the implicit emotional regulation effects of participants with an expressive type of implicit attitude toward emotional regulation and significantly improve depressive states in individuals with subthreshold depressão.",

    "abstract": "Combined with conventional drugs or alone, Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has been widely applied for influenza tratamento in China. The study summarizes the current evidences of clinical studies of TCM for influenza. We searched all the clinical studies of TCM therapies for all kinds of influenzas published in Chinese or English in CNKI, Wanfang Data, SinoMED, VIP, PubMed, and Embase from their inception to April 2025. Inclusion criteria: (1) patients who met the diagnostic criteria of influenza, including influenza A, influenza B, swine influenza, avian influenza, and general influenza; (2) TCM Intervention; (3) The control group received western medicine or other traditional Chinese medicine; (4) All eligible resultado indicators; (5) The study design was limited to randomized / non randomized controlled trials, cohort studies, case-control studies, prospective case series, and cross-sectional studies.We bibliometrically analyzed the included studies and assessed the reporting quality. A total of 606 clinical studies(involving 179,075 influenza patients) including 571 randomized controlled trials (RCTs),13 non-randomized controlled studies, 3 cohort studies, 2 case control studies,2 cross-sectional studies and 15 prospective case series studies were included.The top influenza type was Influenza A. About half of the studies (48%) applied TCM terapia combined with conventional tratamento, while half of the studies(50%) applied only TCM terapia in the intervenção groups.The most frequently reported resultado was clinical symptom improvement (553 studies, 91.25%), including the fever, cough, sore throat, nasal congestion and runny nose, etc, followed by the overall response rateORRaccording to the improvement of patients' symptoms and signs (475 studies, 78.38%), rate of adverse reaction (198 studies, 32.67%), Immune function level (105 studies, 17.32%), Serum levels of inflammatory factors (102 studies, 16.83%), and the fatigue (38 studies, 6.27%). In addition, some special resultado indicators were also reported, including the Canadian acute respiratory illness and flu scale (CARIFS)score, the Bowel function index(BFI)score, the Disease activity index(DAI)score, CRP and PCT level, improvement of imaging examination (X-ray), appetite, thirst, abdominal distension, anorexia, constipation and sweating, tongue coating and pulse ,and the negative emotion score such as the Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD), all of which were better treated by TCM There are various methods treating influenza with traditional Chinese Medicine as monoterapia or in combination with conventional medicine.

    "abstract": "Mental health conditions have become a growing global burden, contributing to disability, reduced qualidade de vida, and excess mortality. Despite increasing awareness, mental healthcare systems often fell short in terms of accessibility, efetividade, and long-term resultados. The dominant biomedical model showed notable limitations, including over-reliance on medication, which often leads to significant side effects, especially in the long term, alongside high relapse rates and tratamento resistance. In response, integrative mental healthcare has emerged as a promising framework based on whole-person, personalized, collaborative, and baseado em evidence care. Traditional, Complementary, and Integrative Healthcare (TCIH) systems offer a wide range of modalities and theoretical perspectives that align with this framework, yet their potential remains underexplored. This narrative review aimed to assess the contribution of TCIH to mental healthcare by synthesizing diverse sources of evidence, highlighting opportunities, challenges, and suggested future directions. We conducted a narrative review of peer-reviewed literature, including RCTs, revisão sistemáticas and meta-analyses, as well as grey literature, and other relevant publications. Literature was sourced through two complementary search strategies. We conducted a broad search for conceptual, theoretical, and policy-related sources on TCIH and mental health. In parallel, we conducted targeted searches in databases like PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library, cross-referencing TCIH modalities with mental health terms to identify relevant empirical studies. Sources that met inclusion criteria and passed exclusion screening were categorized to support a structured and multidimensional synthesis of findings. Emerging themes suggested that several TCIH modalities, including atenção plena, traditional Chinese medicine, yoga, nature-based therapies, and Indigenous healing practices, hold promise for addressing mental conditions such as depressão, ansiedade, and trauma, as well as promoting resilience and well-being. The contribution of each modality was examined through theoretical, psychiatric, social, and neurobiological perspectives, based on available literature. Although evidence levels varied, initial findings highlighted the value of TCIH both as stand-alone and as complements to standard tratamentos. The review also discusses key challenges, gaps, and opportunities in integrating TCIH into mental healthcare systems. At the research level, while modalities such as atenção plena and acupuntura have received growing research attention, many TCIH modalities remain understudied due to research prioritizing, funding and methodological limitations. The review calls for novel, interdisciplinary, and context-sensitive methodologies, including the use of digital tools and AI-assisted data synthesis, to better reflect the complexity and nuance of TCIH intervençãos in the mental health field. At the systemic level, barriers include professional skepticism, regulatory inconsistencies, limited insurance coverage, and insufficient inclusion of TCIH in education and policy. Nonetheless, the review highlights clear opportunities: adopting inclusive research methods, fostering interprofessional collaboration, and integrating TCIH into clinical guidelines, training programs, and saúde pública strategies - to expand the accessible, cost-effective, and culturally informed support that TCIH can provide for mental health, especially within community care. This review is ongoing, with detailed findings to follow. Initial analysis suggests growing evidence supporting TCIH contribution across mental health conditions. Further research is needed to map these contributions and guide policy toward more holistic, sustainable models of mental healthcare.",

As the disease progresses, caregiving demands tend to increase, potentially leading to substantial physical and mental health consequences for family caregivers. In this context, self-compassion has emerged as a protective psychological resource, with potential to mitigate the negative effects associated with caregiving.Objective: To identify intervençãos with the potential to enhance self-compassion among family caregivers of people with dementia. A scoping review was conducted across eight electronic databases: PubMed, BVS, EMBASE, ProQuest, PsycINFO, LILACS, ERIC, and CINAHL. The search strategy included the following descriptors: dementia, self-compassion, empathy, family, caregivers, and mental health. Studies published in English that addressed atenção plena-based and/or compassion-based intervençãos were included. Rayyan software was used to assist in the screening and selection phases. The search identified 280 articles, of which six met the inclusion criteria. The intervençãos involved Yoga, Mindfulness, Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), Self-compassion-based Therapy, and Mentalization. The studies indicated improvements in emotional well-being, grief, interpersonal relationships, ansiedade, acceptance, and qualidade de vida. However, only three of the six studies reported an increase in self-compassion levels among participants. The literature highlights the potential of certain atenção plena- and compassion-based intervençãos to promote self-compassion among caregivers of people with dementia.",

    "abstract": "COVID-19, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, manifests in various ways, ranging from mild, flu-like symptoms to severe conditions such as severe pneumonia and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome. One of the frequently reported sensory dysfunctions is anosmia (loss of smell) and ageusia (loss of taste), which significantly impact patients' qualidade de vida.This is a revisão sistemática (SR) protocol developed according to the recommendations of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review Protocols, registered in the PROSPERO database under code CRD42023458158. The objective of this SR is to investigate the effect of using integrative and complementary practices in the rehabilitation of olfactory dysfunction in people with COVID-19 The SR was conducted following the recommendations of the Joanna Briggs Institute.The guiding question, formulated according to the PICO acronym, is: P=adults with COVID-19, I=integrative and complementary practices, C=standard tratamento, O=olfactory dysfunction rehabilitation. Controlled and uncontrolled descriptors were used according to the information sources, with the Boolean operators \"OR\" and \"AND.\"The article search was conducted in September 2023, in the following information sources: MEDLINE via PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, LILACS, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Web of Science, Scopus, and gray literature (Google Scholar). There were no restrictions on the publication date or language of the studies. Inclusion criteria were randomized controlled trials in which integrative and complementary practices were used in adult individuals for the purpose of rehabilitating olfactory dysfunction related to SARS-CoV-2 infection, treated at any level of healthcare, with standard tratamento as the comparator in the studies. Studies involving pediatric populations, cases of anosmia without a diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection, or individuals with central nervous system damage or damage to the olfactory field were excluded.The primary resultado is the rehabilitation of olfactory dysfunction, assessed using validated questionnaires or tests to evaluate olfactory sensitivity. The secondary resultado is the possible efeitos adversos of the intervençãos. Articles retrieved from the databases were exported to EndNote software for duplicate removal and then to Rayyan software for the study selection process Results found to date: 114 MEDLINE articles, 302 EMBASE, 20 CINAHL, 40 Cochrane, 124 SCOPUS, 48 Web of Science, 02 LILACS, and 187 gray literature, totaling 837. Eighteen articles met the eligibility criteria. The study selection is being conducted in two stages by two independent, blinded reviewers. The first stage involved reading titles and abstracts, and the second involved reading the full articles. The methodological quality of the studies will be analyzed using an instrument from the Joanna Briggs Institute, and the level of evidence will be assessed using GRADE. If a metanálise can be conducted, the R meta-package will be used to analyze the data, and the results will be presented using a forest plot. Otherwise, a narrative synthesis will be performed to present the studies included in the SR, considering the strength of the evidence, possible inconsistencies, and implications for practice.",

    "abstract": "The need for solutions that enable wound healing has driven the study of new alternatives. Therefore, essential oils may be a promising artifact in relation to the tratamento of wounds, since the tratamento of infections and inflammations are still important issues. The objective of this study was to investigate the evidence available in the literature on the effect of the topical use of essential oils on wound healing in humans. The protocol for this review was developed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review Protocols and is registered in the PROSPERO database under code CRD42021269456. This is a revisão sistemática whose search for articles was carried out on November 17, 2021 in databases, in addition to gray literature, manual search and consultation with researchers. In order to enable updating the review, the bibliographic search was updated in January 2025, but no new studies that met the guiding question were retrieved. No limits were established regarding the year of publication or language of the articles. Randomized ensaio clínicos and non-randomized ensaio clínicos with intervenção and comparator groups were included in this review. Two reviewers participated in the selection and critical evaluation of the studies independently. The quality of evidence was analyzed using instruments proposed by the Joanna Briggs Institute and the risk of bias assessment for randomized studies was performed using the RoB-2.0 tool, to evaluate studies without randomization the ROBINS-I tool was used. Thirteen studies were included in this review, eight randomized ensaio clínicos and five non-randomized ensaio clínicos. The most predominant type of wound treated was episiotomy, and lavender essential oil was the most used in the intervenção group of the included studies. The data from this review were presented through descriptive analysis and narrative synthesis, according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses. Meta-analysis was not possible considering the clinical and methodological heterogeneity of the studies. The included studies demonstrate that there is interest in the topical use of essential oils in wound tratamento as a low-cost and accessible alternative for patients and health professionals, especially lavender and tea tree essential oil. However, routine clinical use still depends on studies with better design and methodological rigor. Although a metanálise was not feasible due to the significant clinical and methodological heterogeneity of the studies, the descriptive analysis suggests a growing interest in the use of essential oils for wound healing, particularly lavender oil. However, current evidence is limited. Most of the included studies that used lavender oil had a high risk of bias or low methodological rigor, which prevents the routine recommendation of these tratamentos in clinical practice. For essential oils to be considered a viable alternative, further research is needed, such as randomized ensaio clínicos, representative samples, and details on the species, concentration, dose, and origin of the oil, to assess the benefits of their use compared to conventional therapies standardized by healthcare institutions and services.",

    "abstract": "Low anterior resection syndrome (LARS) is a common complication after anus-preserving surgery for rectal cancer, characterized by frequent defecation, urgency, and changes in stool consistency, which affects the physical and mental health of patients. This study aims to explore the efficacy and segurança of acupuntura in the tratamento of LARS. This single-arm trial enrolled patients (aged 18-75 years) with LARS scores >20 post-surgery, Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) 60, life expectancy >3 months, and capacity for self-reported resultados and consent. Exclusion criteria included prior anorectal surgery/neurological injury, fecal incontinence, acupuntura intolerance, concurrent bowel diseases/complications, sacral deformity precluding acupoint localization, severe comorbidities, or participation in other trials. The intervenção comprised electroacupuntura primarily at Baliao acupoints, administered 3 times weekly for 4 weeks (12 sessions total). Outcomes included LARS score and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center Bowel Function Instrument (MSKCC) for bowel symptoms, and EQ-5D-5L and EORTC QLQ-C30 for qualidade de vida (QoL). Safety was assessed via weekly adverse event monitoring and pre-/post-tratamento blood/urine/stool tests, liver/kidney function, and infection markers. Fifty-one patients were enrolled (April 2023 - April 2025); 44 completed tratamento and assessments. Mean age was 54.4 ± 9.9 years (66.7% male). Mean LARS duration was 19.0 ± 20.7 months; 66.7% had protective stomas (mean closure time: 6.2 ± 4.1 months), and 62.7% received radioterapia. LARS onset was within 1 month post-op in 49 patients. Primary Outcome: LARS score reduction at 4 weeks was 86.3% (95% CI: 74.3%, 93.2%), exceeding the target (60%). Scores decreased significantly at all weekly assessments (p<0.001 vs. baseline: 39 [35,41]) and across all 5 LARS items (p<0.05). Bowel Function (MSKCC): Total score improved significantly (53.0 [46.0,59.0] vs. 64.5 [58.0,71.0]; p<0.001). Stool frequency/urgency and abnormal defecation sensation subscales increased (p<0.001). Mean daily bowel movements decreased (9 [6,15] vs. 5 [4,7]; p<0.001). QoL (EQ-5D-5L): Health utility (0.774 [0.717,0.845] vs. 0.912 [0.904,0.957]; p<0.001) and VAS scores (70 [60,80] vs. 82.5 [75,90]; p<0.001) improved significantly, with notable gains in usual activities, pain/discomfort, and ansiedade/depressão (p<0.001). QoL (EORTC QLQ-C30): Significant improvements (p<0.05) occurred in 13 domains: global health, physical, role, emotional, cognitive, and social functioning, financial difficulties, fatigue, pain, dyspnea, insomnia, constipation, and diarrhea. Safety: No serious adverse events were reported. Electroacupuntura primarily targeting the Baliao acupoints significantly improved bowel function and qualidade de vida in patients with LARS after rectal cancer surgery, demonstrating a favorable segurança profile.",

    "abstract": "Over the past two decades, the use of hypnosis for analgesic and relaxation purposes has grown significantly in France: it is now employed in the management of dor crônica, in dental practices, in emergency and oncology departments, and even in operating theatres. Hypnosis is also increasingly promoted as a response to a wide range of psychological issues, including addiction, eating disorders, stress, ansiedade, and insomnia. Nevertheless, its position within the French healthcare system remains tenuous, as there is an absence of a legal framework to regulate its practice. The Hyp-Hope project Healing through Hypnosis: Therapeutic Promises and Transformations of Health Practices (coordinated by B. Hauray) seeks to investigate this development. Funded by the French National Research Agency (2024-2027), the project brings together three research centers and ten researchers in sociology, anthropology, and psychology. This paper draws on qualitativo data collected by the author as part of the Hyp-Hope project. It is based on: a) 18 interviews with professionals using hypnosis in their therapeutic work, some of whom have played pivotal roles in the development of therapeutic hypnosis in France; b) observations of dor crônica hypnosis consultations (7 half-days) and dor crônica self-management workshops (5 half-days) conducted in three different French hospitals; and c) data collected through the authors participation in three training workshops in therapeutic hypnosis designed for healthcare professionals (8 days). This paper will first offer an analysis of the development of therapeutic hypnosis in France. It will highlight the key role played by a growing market for hypnosis training, which has progressively opened up to non-medical practitioners. It will show how the expansion of hypnosis for both pain management/sedation, on the one hand, and psychological issues, on the other hand, has been shaped by mutually reinforcing dynamics of credibility-building and public visibility. It will explore the tensions that this plural expansion generates among healthcare professionals, as well as between medical and non-medical hypnotherapists. Second, the paper will examine the trajectories of healthcare professionals (psychiatrists, general practitioners, nurses, anaesthesiologists, psychologists, dentists) who have chosen to incorporate hypnosis into their practice. It will analyse how hypnosis has allowed them to re-center the caregiverpatient relationship within the therapeutic process and to engage more effectively with the subjective dimension of care. Third, the paper will focus on the case of dor crônica to more precisely analyze how hypnosis may contribute to the definition of new therapeutic practices. It will argue that hypnosis is presented as a particularly appropriate response to the complex nature of dor crônicaencompassing physiological, psychological, social, and existential dimensions. It will show that hypnoterapia primarily aims to help patients break out of immobility, regain a sense of agency, and reconfigure their relationship to pain, both through the therapeutic alliance and the development of self-hypnosis techniques. The project Hyp-hope aims to contributes to three cross-cutting areas of inquiry: (a) mindbody relations in medicine and healthcare; (b) the place of non-conventional medicine in France; and (c) the interplay between (de)medicalization and (de) pathologization at the intersection of health and well-being.",

    "abstract": "Acupuncture, a traditional practice of Chinese Medicine, has been widely used as a complementary approach in treating various health conditions, including common mental disorders such as depressão. Studies have demonstrated its potential as a complementary approach in the management of emotional disorders, such as Common Mental Disorders (CMDs)conditions that are increasingly affecting populations worldwide. This cross-sectional study aimed to investigate the impact of acupuntura on reducing depressive symptoms, improving qualidade de vida, and modulating oxidative stress in university students. The study was approved by the ethics committee under opinion no. 6.731.546/2024, and all participants signed an Consentimento Informado Form. The sample consisted of 28 participants, selected by convenience, who underwent ten acupuntura sessions. Before and after the intervenção, participants completed sociodemographic questionnaires, the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21), and the Short Form Health Survey (SF-36). They also underwent energetic assessment using the Ryodoraku method and blood collection for analysis of oxidative stress markers. The acupuntura points used were: GV20 and Yin Tang (central, single points), and PC6, HT7, LR3, and SP6 (bilateral points). All data were statistically analyzed to assess the impact of acupuntura tratamento on the measured variables. Most participants were female, single, aged up to 28 years, lived with family, reported weekly alcohol consumption, stress, and dissatisfaction with leisure time. After the intervenção, reductions were observed in depressão (from 67.85% to 39.28%; p = 0.039), ansiedade (75% to 50%; p = 0.039), and stress (82.14% to 50%; p = 0.012) according to the DASS-21. The SF-36 showed significant improvements in the domains of general health status (from 54.46 to 61.14; p = 0.010), vitality (36.43 to 46.25; p = 0.003), emotional aspects (27.38 to 45.24; p = 0.041), and mental health (51.86 to 60.43; p = 0.004). Ryodoraku analysis indicated improvements in all evaluated meridians, although without statistically significant differences. Regarding oxidative stress, an increase in protein thiol (P-SH) levels was observed (from 2.69 to 4.16 nmol/mL), as well as a reduction in thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) (from 13.9 to 9.31 nmol/mL), suggesting improvement in antioxidant status after tratamento. The results indicate that acupuntura was effective in reducing depressive symptoms, with positive effects also on ansiedade and stress, while contributing to improved qualidade de vida and modulation of oxidative stress. However, interpretation of these findings should consider the limitations of the cross-sectional design. Therefore, the results suggest that acupuntura is a promising complementary healthcare intervenção for university students mental health, with benefits associated with redox balance, although further randomized controlled trials with larger populations are needed to better understand these effects.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Mental health within the university community has become an increasingly relevant topic. Well-being promotion practices, such as atenção plena meditação, are aligned with WHO guidelines. The MBRP-Ser protocol, initially delivered in person over eight weekly 90-minute sessions, has been expanded to online formats with greater reach. However, comparative studies between these modalities have not yet been conducted. OBJECTIVE: To compare preliminary resultados of the MBRP-Ser protocol in in-person and online modalities within a university community. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a clinical study with a convenience sample in either in-person (n=21) or online (n=29) formats. The study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee at UNIFESP (CAAE 76954923.2.0000.5505). Mental health indicators, atenção plena levels, and self-compassion were analyzed. Repeated measures ANOVA was used to compare pre- and post-intervenção results between groups, with a significance level of 5% (p-value < 0.05). The mean age of participants was 32.2 years, with a predominance of women (77.5%), single (62.5%), White (62.5%), with incomplete higher education (50%), and a family income between 2 and 4 minimum wages (35%). When comparing the atenção plena scale (FFMQ-SF), participants in both groups showed a significant increase in the total score (p = 0.0094) at the post-intervenção time point in the in-person group (M = 3.42; SD = 0.38) and online group (M = 3.53; SD = 0.63), compared to pre-intervenção in-person (M = 3.14; SD = 0.43) and online (M = 3.15; SD = 0.59).One of the FFMQ-SF facets, acting mindfully, also showed a significant increase (p = 0.0233) when comparing pre-intervenção scores in the in-person (M = 2.87; SD = 0.76) and online (M = 2.88; SD = 1.25) groups with post-intervenção in-person (M = 3.56; SD = 0.52) and online (M = 3.33; SD = 1.21).The total self-compassion score (SCS) also increased significantly (p = 0.0053), when contrasting pre-intervenção in-person (M = 2.71; SD = 0.93) and online (M = 3.41; SD = 0.51) with post-intervenção in-person (M = 3.16; SD = 0.73) and online (M = 3.72; SD = 0.66). Two SCS subscalescommon humanity and isolationalso showed significant changes over time. Common humanity increased (p = 0.0324) while isolation decreased (p = 0.0111). A reduction in ansiedade (HADS) was also observed in both groups (p = 0.0336), when comparing pre-intervenção in-person (M = 9.78; SD = 6.16) and online (M = 6.64; SD = 3.85) with post-intervenção in-person (M = 7.44; SD = 3.61) and online (M = 6.00; SD = 4.10). Improvements were also noted in depressive symptoms and insomnia, although not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: This pilot study suggests that the SER protocol contributed to increased atenção plena levels, reduced ansiedade symptoms, and enhanced self-compassion in both in-person and online groups, demonstrating its potential for promoção da saúde with similar resultados across both modalities.",

Studies have demonstrated its potential as a complementary approach in the management of emotional disorders, such as Common Mental Disorders (CMDs)conditions that are increasingly affecting populations worldwide. This cross-sectional study aimed to evaluate the impact of auriculoterapia on improving symptoms related to CMDs in the population of Southwest Paraná, Brazil. The study was approved by the ethics committee under opinion no. 6.275.792/2023, and all participants signed an informed consent form. The sample consisted of 297 participants, selected by convenience, who underwent eight sessions of auriculoterapia. Before and after the tratamento, participants completed a sociodemographic questionnaire, the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21), the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10), and underwent an energy assessment using the Ryodoraku method. In a subgroup of 115 patients, blood samples were collected by venipuncture before and after the tratamento to measure basal cortisol levels and oxidative stress markers (vitamin C, protein thiols  P-SH, and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances  TBARS). Auriculoterapia was applied to the Shen Men, Kidney, Autonomic Nervous System, Liver, Spleen-Pancreas, Heart, Anxiety, and San Jiao points. All data were subjected to statistical analysis to assess the impact of the tratamento on the evaluated variables. Approximately 54% of participants were female, aged between 18 and 30 years. Regarding the DASS-21 results, 65.16% of patients were classified within the normal range for depressão before tratamento, increasing to 80.31% after tratamento (p=0.01); for ansiedade, 58.43% were within the normal range before, and 71.35% after (p=0.01); and for stress, 74.21% were normal before, rising to 87.64% after tratamento (p=0.01). The PSS-10 results indicated a reduction in perceived stress levels from 22.59 to 18.80 (p=0.01). Ryodoraku analysis showed improvement in all meridians evaluated after tratamento, although without statistically significant differences. Regarding cortisol, 13.04% of patients had levels outside the reference values before tratamento, decreasing to 6.09% afterward (p=0.01). As for oxidative stress, significant differences were observed in P-SH levels, which increased from 2.28 to 3.78 nmol/mL (p<0.001), and in TBARS levels, which decreased from 5.96 to 2.92 nmol/mL (p<0.001), suggesting improvement in the antioxidant profile after tratamento. Improvement was observed in all variables related to CMDs, as well as in cortisol levels and oxidative stress markers, indicating increased antioxidant activity and reduced production of oxidants following auriculoterapia tratamento. The evidence suggests that auriculoterapia may represent a promising complementary care strategy for promoting mental health, with benefits associated with redox balance and regulation of cortisol levels.",

    "abstract": "The current concept of health considered multidimensional represents the basis for holistic care that can be developed by health professionals through integrative and complementary health practices (PICS). In saúde pública, the nurse is an active agent in Primary Care, who can use traditional medicine as a strategy for prevenção, promotion and health protection. However, the provision of therapies in Basic Health Units (UBS) is related to the knowledge of the professional, which implies their attitudes and practices. By promoting care with alternative therapies, the nurse corroborates the doctrinal principle of integrality and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the 2030 Agenda. Therefore, the objective is to investigate the scientific literature on the knowledge, attitudes and practices of nurses in relation to PICS in primary healthcare. This is an integrative review that was developed in four stages, through a survey of publications from November to December 2024 in the Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online (MEDLINE/PubMed) database. The following inclusion criteria were considered: the object of study must be related to the KAP survey, mention some KAP performed by a nursing professional, and be available in full and free of charge in electronic format. This review suggested a scarcity of studies that address KAP focusing on the KAP method, since of the 90 articles found, only 9 answered the guiding question and most were not available in full and free of charge. Four articles were analyzed, two from Brazil, one from Italy and one from Australia. They indicated that although nurses have some knowledge about alternative therapies, they do not feel confident to develop these practices and associate this with a lack of scientific knowledge about PICS, management support and implementation of regulations. Final Considerations: The articles suggest that nurses' attitudes and practices are related to their knowledge about alternative medicine, and show the need to strengthen continuing education in health organizations, to promote PICS training for professionals, in addition to greater interaction between management and care.",

    "abstract": "American ginseng(panax quinquefolius) is a precious Chinese medicinal material with both medicinal and edible properties and has been widely applied on a large scale at present. However, American ginseng has the problem of unclear clinical positioning, which affects the accuracy and reliability of its clinical application.To clarify the scope of clinical indications for west ginseng slices by retrieving currently published TCM clinical practice guidelines or expert consensus of traditional Chinese medicine(TCM). Seven databases (CNKI, Wanfang, VIP, SinoMed, PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library) were searched for clinical practice guidelines or expert consensus relating to American ginseng. Search terms included \"American ginseng\" \"clinical guidelines\" and \"expert consensus\". Literature management software was used for management and deduplication. Dual independent screening and dual independent data extraction were performed, with disagreements resolved by a third reviewer. A total of 231 literature were retrieved. After deduplication and screening, 114 clinical practice guidelines or expert consensus recommending formulations containing American ginseng were ultimately included. After analysis, the recommended TCM formulations containing American ginseng were used in the tratamento of 47 disease, including cancer diseases such as liver cancer and ovarian cancer; respiratory diseases such as common cold and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; endocrine diseases such as diabetes and diabetic nephropathy; immune diseases such as Sjögrens syndrome and allergic purpura; traditional Chinese medical diseases such as heatstroke, belching, and metrorrhagia and metrostaxis; emergency diseases such as shock and other diseases. The top three TCM syndromes by frequency of occurrence were: qi-yin deficiency syndrome (mentioned in 60 clinical practice guidelines or expert consensus), kidney yang deficiency syndrome and qi-blood deficiency syndrome (mentioned in 10 clinical practice guidelines or expert consensus), and qi deficiency syndrome (mentioned in 8 clinical practice guidelines or expert consensus). The most frequently recommended TCM proprietary medicines containing American ginseng were Shenyan Kangfu Tablets, Compound Zaofan Pills, and Shengmai Yin/Shengmai Powder. The core syndrome for American ginseng slices is qi-yin deficiency syndrome, with broad application in diseases including cancers Respiratory system diseases and so on. Further research is needed to confirm its priority indications.",

The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of Fangfeng Tongsheng Pill combined with normal rat colony transplantation on the \"intestinal flora-SCFAs-GPR43-gastrointestinal peptide\" pathway in obese rats. After the obese rat model was successfully established through high-fat diet feeding, the rats were randomly divided into the following groups: Normal Control Group (NC), Obesity Model Group (M), Normal Flora Transplantation Group (FMT), Fangfeng Tongsheng Pill Group (FFTS), Combined Normal Flora and Fangfeng Tongsheng Pill Group (LH), and Microecological Preparation Medilac-Vita Group (MMA). Following induction of pseudo-germ-free conditions in rats via antibiotic solution gavage, tratamentos including normal flora transplantation, Fangfeng Tongsheng Pill administration, combined normal flora and Fangfeng Tongsheng Pill tratamento, and Medilac-Vita supplementation were administered according to group assignments. High-throughput sequencing was employed to analyze changes in gut microbiota composition; gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was utilized to quantify acetic acid, propionic acid, and butyric acid levels among short-chain fatty acids; immunohistochemistry was performed to evaluate GPR43 expression in liver tissues; enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was conducted to measure gastrointestinal peptide concentrations in rat serum; and an automatic biochemical analyzer was used to assess cholesterol and triglyceride levels in serum. At the phylum level, the LH group had significantly lower Aspergillus (P < 0.05) but higher Desulfovibrio (P < 0.05). At the family level, Escherichiaceae and Streptococcus pepticus decreased (P < 0.05), while Rumatobacterium and Trematobacterium increased (P < 0.05). Acetic, propionic, and butyric acid levels were significantly higher in the LH group than in the FFTS and FMT groups. GPR43 was detected in all liver tissues, with lower expression in group M versus NC (P < 0.05). GLP-1 levels rose significantly in the LH, MMA, FMT, and FFTS groups compared to M (P < 0.05) but were lower in MMA, FMT, and FFTS versus LH (P < 0.05). PYY levels were higher in LH, MMA, FMT, and FFTS than in M (P < 0.05), though MMA had lower PYY than LH (P < 0.05), while FMT and FFTS showed elevated levels (P < 0.05). MTL levels in M, MMA, NC, and LH exceeded those in FFTS and FMT (P < 0.05). GAS levels in NC, LH, and MMA were higher than in FMT and FFTS (P < 0.05). Serum TG in the M group was significantly higher than in NC (P < 0.05), whereas the LH group had lower TG than M (P < 0.05). Normal flora transplantation, Fangfeng Tongsheng Pill (FFT), fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) combined with FFT, and the microecological agent Medilac-Vita exert protective effects against high-fat diet-induced obesity in rats by modulating theintestinal microbiotaSCFAsGPR43gastrointestinal peptide axis. Notably, the combination of FFT and FMT demonstrates a synergistic effect, offering superior therapeutic advantages. These findings offer a new approach to combining traditional Chinese medicine with local microbiota regulation for the tratamento of obese patients.",

    "abstract": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized primarily by persistent joint inflammation and pain. Approximately 50% of RA patients experience dor crônica, which limits physical function, increases disease activity, and predisposes them to psychological problems such as ansiedade and depressão, thereby reducing qualidade de vida and increasing socioeconomic burdens. As a complementary and alternative medicine, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has fewer side effects than conventional Western medicine and can improve qualidade de vida of patients. This evidence summary summarizes all TCM therapies for RA patients in the last five years to instruct the clinical practice. The process of generating different levels of evidence and applying them to clinical practice always involves a lengthy period of time, therefore, it is also the necessary step before evidence translation. A top-down search of relevant literature was conducted according to the 6S evidence model, including clinical decisions, guidelines, best practices, evidence summaries, expert consensus, and revisão sistemáticas. The literature was evaluated, and evidence was extracted independently by two researchers. The evidence was appraised using the corresponding quality appraisal tools and integrated with an baseado em evidence team consisting of five members. Forty-seven publications were included, including one clinical decision, three guidelines, four expert consensus, one evidence summary, thirty-seven revisão sistemáticas. Twenty-two items of best evidence were summarized from seven areas: Traditional Chinese Medicine/Chinese Herbal Medicine, Chinese Patent Medicine, Traditional Chinese Medicine Decoction, Manual Therapy (acupuntura, moxibustion etc.) , TCM External Intervention, Therapeutic Exercises, and Integrative traditional Chinese and Western medicine. TCM Herbs are used across RA stages (prevenção, active, late) to alleviate symptoms, reduce progression, and regulate bone metabolism. In Chinese patent medicines, some specific formulas (e.g., Biqi, Wangbi, Kunxian Capsules) target different RA patterns to improve symptoms, lab markers, and QoL, but require attention to contraindications and adverse reactions. Many TCM Decoctions (e.g., Simiao Xiaobi, Wutou, Guizhi Shaoyao Zhimu) prescribed based on RA patterns significantly improve symptoms and lab markers, often with fewer adverse events. Manual therapies like acupuntura (various types), moxibustion, and massage effectively reduce pain, inflammation, and disease activity, especially when combined with other tratamentos. TCM Fumigation, wax terapia, and external applications improve efficacy and segurança, often outperforming Western medicine alone in some metrics. While therapeutic exercises: like Tai Chi/Qigong are conditionally recommended to maintain engagement and physical function. Combining TCM (herbs, decoctions, patent meds, acupuntura, extracts) with Western DMARDs consistently shows superior efficacy in improving symptoms, lab markers, and reducing disease activity/side effects compared to either alone. This review summarizes the best evidence for TCM intervençãos for patients with RA, which can be used by clinical healthcare professionals to have various TCM choices to address symptoms induced by RA. Subsequently, the findings of this study will serve as the source of content for the rapid recommendation of TCM (a knowledge transformation product), for evidence transformation, which will be beneficial in bridging the gap between evidence and practice.",

    "abstract": "Viscum album L. (VA) is a semiparasitic plant from the Santalaceae family widely used in complementary cancer terapia. Commercial aqueous VA extracts are available for subcutaneous administration, but this route is not ideal for pediatric patients and is often associated with discomfort. In this context, this study aimed to develop and characterize PLA/Pluronic® F127 (PF127) nanofibers containing an ethanolic extract of Abies alba VA, being a less invasive and controlled-release alternative. Core-shell nanofibers were produced by electrospinning, varying PF127 concentrations (2.5%, 5%, and 10% w/v) while maintaining PLA at 15% w/v and VA 2.5% w/v. Morphological characterization was performed using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), with gold-coated samples analyzed at 1015 kV and 5000× magnification. Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) evaluated internal fiber structure and drug dispersion. SEM images confirmed the successful formation of nanofibers under all tested conditions. Variations in PF127 concentration affected fiber diameter. Shapiro-Wilk normality test indicated that the data did not follow a normal distribution (p<0.05). Kruskal-Wallis test revealed significant differences between the groups (p<0.05), confirming the influence of PF127 concentration on morphology. Dunns post-hoc test showed no statistically significant difference between the 2.5% and 10% PF127 concentrations, both yielding the smallest fiber diameters. TEM analysis indicated better drug dispersion at 10%, guiding its selection for further studies. PF127 concentration plays a crucial role in nanofiber morphology and drug dispersion. The 10% formulation showed the best characteristics and was selected for further biological evaluation. Future experiments will investigate cytotoxicity against normal and cancer cells and healing properties through fibroblast and keratinocyte wound-healing assays. These studies aim to investigate the efficacy and segurança of the developed system for biomedical applications.",

    "abstract": "Chronic pain (CP) is an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage, with multidimensional consequences, affecting personal, professional, and social life. This study addresses the implementation of an interprofessional team (physician, pharmacist, physiotherapist, nutritionist, and art therapist) to provide comprehensive care to people with dor crônica in 2024, in Secondary Health Care at the Regional Specialty Center of the municipality of São Mateus (CRESM), in northern Espírito Santo. Art terapia was used to support care and promote self-care for mental health and well-being. This is a pilot study with a qualitativo approach. Inclusion criteria: adult patients diagnosed with dor crônica treated at CRESM, of any race/color, ethnicity, or gender. Patients with cancer pain, functional dependence, or cognitive impairment that would hinder understanding of the guidelines were excluded. The sample (89% female; 75% with low education; and unfavorable socioeconomic conditions) was a convenience sample, considering spontaneous demand for the service. Referrals for art terapia were made by a medical professional, based on a clinical mental health assessment. In the first week of each group, an initial interview was conducted to collect sociodemographic and clinical data. Pain and qualidade de vida were assessed using the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) and the Visual Analog Scale (VAS). Twenty-two patients were followed weekly in groups of up to 12 participants for 16 weeks. Each weekly session lasted two and a half hours and presented an expressive and creative approach using various artistic languages (visual arts, photography, music, dance, and theater). At the end of each session, participants shared their experiences of the creative process and their perceptions of their artwork. The art therapist recorded each session in a logbook, which was then used for content analysis. In the final week of the group, participants were assessed through a new interview to reapply the instruments used in the pre-intervenção phase. The team conducted biweekly clinical conversations. Capturing and recording participants' subjectivities in the sessions was one of the limitations of this study. In these groups, CP, initially measured by the Visual Analgesic Scale (0-10), ranged from moderate (3-7, 23%) to severe (7-10, 71%), and was associated with poor qualidade de vida, work absences, high tratamento costs, impact on qualidade de vida, negatively affecting relationships and self-esteem; unfavorable socioeconomic conditions; and professional activities requiring intense physical effort. The expressive activities proposed in the therapeutic groups helped control pain (final CP measurement by the Visual Analgesic Scale ranged from moderate - 83%; severe 17%) and strengthened self-esteem, facilitating the integration of feelings, emotions, and affections. Our preliminary results demonstrate that art terapia is replicable and can be useful for professionals working with people living with dor crônica. The results included positive changes in cognitive and affective functioning, social support, stress levels, psychological processing, pain experiences, and self-representations. These results suggest the relevance of expressive and creative practices in art terapia experiences for the care and self-care of people with dor crônica.",

    "abstract": "Sleep is a vital component of human health. Inadequate sleep negatively affects qualidade de vida, contributing to fatigue, socioeconomic burdens, and behavioral disturbances. Although pharmacological tratamentos are available for sleep disorders, many individuals still report poor sleep quality. As a result, integrative practices such as auriculoterapia have gained traction in managing sleep disturbances. By stimulating specific points on the ear, this technique promotes physiological balance and supports the tratamento of conditions like insomnia. Although recent studies suggest promising results, further rigorous research is necessary to establish clinical guidelines. This study aimed to assess the effects of auriculoterapia on sleep quality in adults. The study was conducted at a higher education institution offering various health-related programs and involved 33 adults with self-reported poor sleep quality, selected through convenience sampling. Inclusion criteria included age 18 years and a Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of 5. Exclusion criteria included auricular contraindications, pregnancy, breastfeeding, or previous auriculoterapia within the past three months. A trained professional administered the intervenção, which consisted of five weekly sessions, with alternating application on each auricle. Mustard seeds were applied to the Shenmen, Kidney, Sympathetic, Subcortex, Occipital, Endocrine, Liver, Spleen, and Anterior Lobe points. Participants were instructed to apply moderate manual pressure to the points three times per day. Sleep quality was assessed pre- and post-intervenção using the PSQI, and data were analyzed with the Wilcoxon signed-rank test, adopting a 5% significance level. The study received ethical approval from the Research Ethics Committee. The sample was mostly composed of single, Catholic women with a monthly income below the minimum wage. A statistically significant improvement was observed in both subjective sleep quality and sleep duration following auriculoterapia (p < 0.05). The results indicate that, based on the adopted protocol, auriculoterapia contributed to improved sleep quality and increased sleep time, demonstrating its potential as a complementary intervenção. Auriculoterapia appears to improve sleep quality in adults, contributing to increased sleep duration. However, further randomized ensaio clínicos are needed to strengthen the evidence base regarding its efetividade.",

    "abstract": "Viscum album L. (VA) is a semiparasitic plant belonging to the Santalaceae family, whose chemical composition varies according to the season. It has been widely used in complementary medicine, particularly in the tratamento of various types of cancer. Prostate cancer is currently the second most common cancer among men worldwide, while cervical cancer remains the fourth leading cause of cancer-related deaths among women. In this context, local drug administration via rectal and vaginal routes offers significant advantages due to the high vascularization of these mucosal tissues, which favors rapid and efficient absorption of active compounds. Additionally, these routes bypass first-pass hepatic metabolism, allowing for targeted delivery to the affected tissue. This study aimed to develop a promising alternative for the local tratamento of prostate and cervical cancer by formulating suppositories and vaginal ovules containing Viscum album tincture, extracted from two different host trees: Abies alba and Malus domestica. The choice of administration routes and dosage forms was intended to leverage both the therapeutic potential of VA and the pharmacokinetic benefits of mucosal delivery. Natural waxes and butters were selected as excipients due to their melting points close to body temperature, providing an ideal dispersion medium while offering moisturizing and antioxidant properties attributed to vitamins A and E. Additionally, these excipients have antifungal properties, contributing to the segurança and stability of the formulations. As part of the initial characterization, the formulations underwent Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy analysis. The spectra revealed characteristic bands of vegetable oils and butters, notably methylene stretching (CH) at 2915 cm¹ and 2850 cm¹, ester carbonyl (C=O) stretching at 1745 cm¹, and COC stretching at 1158 cm¹. An additional band at 3009 cm¹ was identified in some formulations, indicating unsaturation in fatty acids, while a band at 3430 cm¹observed in samples with higher butter contentwas attributed to hydroxyl (OH) stretching, likely related to residual moisture or polar compounds. No signs of degradation of the active compounds or lipid bases were detected, indicating the chemical stability of the formulations during the preparation process. The results indicate that the incorporation of VA tincture into suppositories and vaginal ovules is a viable and potentially effective strategy for the local tratamento of prostate and cervical cancers, respectively. This approach offers promising perspectives for less invasive therapies with higher concentrations of active compounds at the target site. Further studies are warranted to advance this research and evaluate clinical applicability.",

    "abstract": "Brazil has one of the highest prevalence rates of ansiedade worldwide, affecting approximately 9.3% of the population. This condition negatively impacts qualidade de vida and is associated with a range of socioeconomic and behavioral factors. Although pharmacological tratamentos are widely used, their indiscriminate use may lead to efeitos adversos and dependence, reinforcing the need to explore complementary therapies such as auriculoterapia. This technique, based on the stimulation of specific points on the ear, has been associated with symptom relief in various conditions, including ansiedade. While recent studies have shown promising results, more robust evidence is needed to support its clinical application. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of auriculoterapia on ansiedade levels in adults. The study was conducted at a higher education institution with the participation of 38 adults, selected through convenience sampling, who presented moderate to severe ansiedade. Inclusion criteria were age 18 years or older and a moderate to high trait ansiedade score according to the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). Individuals with ear-related contraindications, pregnant or breastfeeding women, and those who had undergone auriculoterapia within the previous three months were excluded. The intervenção was delivered by a trained researcher and consisted of five weekly sessions, with alternating application on each auricle. Mustard seeds were applied to the Shenmen, Kidney, Sympathetic, Heart, Brain Stem, Liver, Spleen, and Anterior Lobe points. Participants were instructed to apply moderate manual pressure to the seeds three times a day. Anxiety levels were assessed before and after the intervenção, and data were analyzed using paired t-tests with a 5% significance level. The study was approved by the Institutional Research Ethics Committee. The sample was predominantly composed of young, single women with a monthly income of up to two minimum wages. A statistically significant reduction in both state and trait ansiedade scores was observed after auriculoterapia (p < 0.05). The findings suggest that auriculoterapia, as implemented in this protocol, contributed to ansiedade reduction in adults, indicating its potential as a complementary intervenção. Auriculoterapia appears to be beneficial for adults with ansiedade. However, further randomized ensaio clínicos are needed to strengthen the evidence base for its efetividade.",

    "abstract": "IgG-mediated food hypersensitivity has been proposed as a contributing factor to a wide range of chronic symptoms, including gastrointestinal discomfort, fatigue, headaches, dermatological conditions, and neuropsychological disturbances. Studies suggest that up to 4560% of patients with unexplained chronic complaints may have clinically relevant IgG-mediated reactions to common foods. Unlike IgE-mediated allergies, which elicit immediate responses, IgG-mediated reactions are delayed, often subclinical, and may contribute to chronic low-grade inflammation. In a randomized controlled trial, Atkinson et al. (2004) demonstrated significant symptom reduction in patients with irritable bowel syndrome following an IgG-based elimination diet. The growing field of integrative and precision medicine increasingly supports the use of food-specific IgG testing to guide personalized dietary intervençãos. The ImuPro test, based on standardized ELISA technology, quantifies IgG antibodies against over 270 food antigens, allowing the identification of delayed hypersensitivities with potential clinical impact. This study aims to evaluate the resultados of patients undergoing personalized elimination or rotational diets based on ImuPro results, assessing symptom improvements across gastrointestinal, dermatological, cognitive, and metabolic domains. This retrospective observational study analyzed clinical survey data from 33 patients who completed the ImuPro test and adhered to dietary changes. Participants answered a structured questionnaire assessing pre-test symptoms, dietary adherence, perceived improvements, and time to clinical response. Data were analyzed descriptively to identify patterns in symptom relief and patient experience. The most common symptoms reported before testing were gastrointestinal disturbances, such as constipation, bloating, and diarrhea, followed by autoimmune-related symptoms and difficulty losing weight. 81.8% of patients reported a 'significant improvement' in symptoms after dietary adjustments. The mean global improvement score (scale 110) was 8.7. 42% of patients noticed improvements within 714 days, while 24% required 1428 days. 33% (11 patients) reported unintentional weight loss, with reductions ranging from 3 to 7.6 kg, mostly over 25 months. Adherence to the elimination or rotational diet was reported as moderate to high by the majority, with some difficulty reported in removing staple foods like eggs and dairy. The results of this observational study suggest that a personalized dietary intervenção based on IgG food hypersensitivity testing may lead to significant clinical improvements in patients with chronic, nonspecific symptoms. Symptom relief was reported in gastrointestinal, dermatological, cognitive, and metabolic domains, reinforcing the relevance of identifying delayed food hypersensitivities in clinical practice. The ImuPro test proved to be a valuable tool in guiding individualized nutritional strategies, especially in cases where conventional diagnostics fail to identify underlying triggers. Incorporating IgG-based testing into integrative medicine protocols may enhance diagnostic precision, support patient-centered care, and reduce long-term symptom burden through targeted dietary modifications. Further prospective studies are warranted to strengthen the evidence base and broaden clinical applications.",

    "abstract": "Traditional, Complementary, and Integrative Medicine (TCIM) encompasses a wide array of health systems worldwide, reflecting cultural diversity and holistic philosophies. Iranian Traditional Medicine (ITM), with over a millennium of documented theory and clinical practice, is a rich example of such systems. This study aims to: (1) explore the global diversity of TCIM through the model of ITM, (2) examine strategies for integrating ITM into contemporary healthcare systems, and (3) analyze ITMs contributions to global health across the lifespan, from child health to palliative care, with attention to saúde pública, education, and planetary well-being. The research uses a qualitativo-interpretive design, combining literature review, policy analysis, and expert interviews with physicians, educators, and policymakers in Irans health system. Data sources include clinical case studies, WHO reports on TCIM, Iranian national health plans, and educational curricula in medical universities. Clinical Practice: Iranian Traditional Medicine (ITM) is rooted in humoral theory and the concept of Mizaj (temperament), guiding individualized diagnosis and care. Hifz al-Sihha (health preservation) is central, promoting preventive practicesbalanced diet, quality sleep, emotional balance, and seasonal adaptation. These measures aid in managing chronic conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, ansiedade, and cancer-related fatigue, complementing modern medicine. Education: Seventeen Iranian medical universities offer postgraduate ITM programs (PhD and residency), officially approved by the Ministry of Health as part of the National ITM Development Plan. These programs combine classical texts with biomedical sciences. Over 1,000 general practitioners have completed certified training. Some universities also include ITM in general medical education, reflecting its formal integration into the national health and education systems. Public Policy and Integration: Since 2006, Irans Ministry of Health has officially recognized ITM within the national healthcare system. A National ITM Development Plan promotes capacity building, research, and service delivery. ITM is now offered in over 120 public clinics and hospitals, supported by regulations, practitioner licensing, and fitoterapia oversight. Public education campaigns promote safe use. Although insurance remains limited, reforms aim to expand coverage. Irans model aligns with WHOs traditional medicine strategies. Iranian Traditional Medicine, through its formal recognition, national policy framework, and progressive integration into healthcare delivery, represents a unique model of traditional medicine modernization. This system not only preserves cultural heritage but also supports sustainability, patient empowerment, and holistic care. Its successful incorporation into saúde pública infrastructures illustrates how TCIM can coexist with biomedicine to enhance resultados. Future growth requires greater international collaboration, policy innovation, and investments in clinical evidence, ensuring ITMs contributions to global and planetary health are fully realized.",

    "abstract": "Traditional Persian Medicine (TPM) represents a rich and diverse medical heritage, shaped by eminent physicians such as Avicenna (Ibn Sina) and Rhazes (al-Razi). Among the therapeutic modalities in TPM, manual therapiesparticularly Hijama (wet cupping), Dalak (massage), and other Amal-e-Yadavi (manual procedures)hold a distinctive place. This study explores the theoretical foundations, clinical applications, and historical continuity of these practices in the context of classical TPM. A narrative and conceptual review methodology was adopted. Primary sources including The Canon of Medicine (Avicenna) and Kitab al-Hawi (Rhazes) were analyzed, supplemented with contemporary acadêmico interpretations. Manual terapia practices were categorized based on their intended use (preventive, curative, detoxifying) and physiological mechanisms. Preliminary ethnomedical data from current TPM practitioners in Iran were also reviewed to assess continuity and variation in application. Avicenna emphasized the humoral balance as a cornerstone of health, recommending massage for improving circulation and nervous balance, while Rhazes advocated for cupping to eliminate morbid humors and stimulate immune response. Both scholars provided systematic guidelines on technique, timing, and contraindications. Today, these modalities continue to be practiced across Iran and neighboring regions, with increasing interest in their integration into complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) globally. Early clinical observations suggest potential benefits in musculoskeletal, neurological, and psychosomatic disorders, though rigorous evidence is still evolving. The insights of Avicenna and Rhazes on manual therapies highlight the intellectual sophistication and therapeutic diversity within TPM. These practices represent not only historical relevance but also potential contributions to global health through integrative care. Further interdisciplinary research is warranted to validate and adapt these approaches within contemporary medical frameworks.",

    "abstract": "In Brazil, since 2006, there has been a National Policy called the National Policy on Integrative and Complementary Health Practices (PNPIC) that establishes Traditional, Complementary, and Integrative Medicine (TCIM) (or Integrative and Complementary Health Practices-PICS, as they are called in Brazil) in the Unified Health System (SUS). In the Brazilian context, nursing was a pioneer in recognizing these practices when, on July 18, 1995, with Normative Opinion No. 004, the Federal Nursing Council recognized alternative therapies as a specialty and/or qualification for nurses. The prevalence of nurses working with TCIM in Brazil is unprecedented data that strengthens the role of nurses, standing out for their generalist training close to the precepts of integrative care. Objective: to analyze the prevalence of nurses working with TCIM in Brazil. A cross-sectional study, based on a national survey and written in accordance with the recommendations of Strengthening the Reporting of Observational studies in Epidemiology (STROBE). Data collection was performed using an online questionnaire from June 2021 to January 2022. The dependent variable in this study was the use of TCIM. Stata IC software, version 16.0, was used for statistical analysis. Descriptive analyses were performed, and the effect measures evaluated were the Prevalence Ratios (PR), performed using Poisson Regression with robust adjustment for variance, with accuracy assessed by 95% Confidence Intervals (95% CI) and the significance of the PR using the Wald Test. The study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee under Certificate of Presentation for Ethical Review number 43306921.6.0000.5347. 1,154 nurses participated in the study. The prevalence of training in TCIM was 502/1,154 (43.50%), with 301/1,154 (26.08%) stating that they had training in auriculoterapia. The prevalence of practice in TCIM was 323/1,154 (27.99%). The most frequent weekly workload dedicated to the application of TCIM was two hours 119/322 (36.96%), with the majority 198/322 (61.49%) of participants applying up to four hours per week. Regarding the workplace where TCIM is practiced, 167/323 (51.70%) use it in Primary Health Care (PHC), corroborating data from research on the situation of PICS in Brazil, where almost 80% of them occur in PHC. Among the most frequent types of care, 287/323 (88.85%) provide individual care and 155/323 (47.99%) provide group educational activities. Among nurses who conduct research on baseado em evidence practices, 250/323 (77.40%) do so in the Virtual Health Library of Complementary and Integrative Traditional Medicines, 215/323 (66.56%) in books, 173/323 (53.56%) in specialized journals, 141/323 (43.65%) on Google, and 70/323 (21.67%) on the evidence map produced by the Brazilian Academic Consortium for Integrative Health. Having a postgraduate degree increases the probability of working in PICS by 99% (PR: 1.99; 95% CI: 1.35-2.94; p<0.001). The most significant place of practice with TCIM was PHC, in the form of individual care, using baseado em evidence approaches. The results reflect the maturation of nursing as a field of study and practice and the growing appreciation of TCIM as evidence.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is part of Integrative Oncology (IO) and has distinct diagnostic and evaluation fundamentals, such as inspecting the tongue to identify alterations in the body. The relevant aspects of the tongue to be identified are humidity, coating, color, size, movement, and other findings such as teeth marks, red dots, cracks, or fissures. BACKGROUND: Considering the scenario of breast cancer and the recommendation of OI associated with conventional tratamento, it is important for professionals working in this area to have access to an up-to-date assessment of the tongues of women during chemoterapia with anthracyclines.OBJECTIVE: This analysis aimed to evaluate tongue changes in women with breast cancer during tratamento with anthracyclines, before and after chemoterapia, divided into 2 groups: acupuntura and control, to study the effect of acupuntura on myelodepressão The population of this study was made up of women recently diagnosed with breast cancer at UNIFESP's Mastology outpatient clinic and with an indication for chemoterapia with anthracyclines. The patients were randomized into two groups: the Acupuncture Group (AG) and the Control Group (CG). All the participants had their tongues photographed before and at the end of tratamento with anthracyclines and had their WBC monitored as an indicator of the level of spinal cord depressão. GA underwent acupuntura intervenção for up to 10 sessions. A total of 26 women were randomized into 2 groups: GA (10) and GC (16). Of these, 7 (26.9%) received an indication for a dense dose according to the service's protocol and therefore received granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) from the first cycle. Thus, in order to analyze the protective effect of acupuntura on the bone marrow, 2 women from the GA and 5 from the CG were excluded. The need for secondary prophylaxis with G-CSF occurred in 72.7% (08/11) of the control group and 12% (01/08) of the acupuntura group (p-value = 0.009). No change over time could be confirmed for most aspects of the tongue in either group. The only exception was for the tongue coating in the control group, where the \"thin/white\" profile was less frequent at the time afterwards (p-value=0.033). Based on the results presented, acupuntura was effective in prophylaxis of myelosuppression, with no significant changes to the tongue; however, the tongue of the CG showed a worsening of the condition during tratamento.",

    "abstract": "The National Institute of Cancer´s Clinical Protocol and Therapeutic Guidelines for Smoking Cessation recognize Integrative Practices as safe intervençãos when used appropriately by trained professionals and as a complementary tratamento for smoking cessation. The objective of this research is to evaluate the efficacy of a homeopathic tratamento (HOM) for smoking cessation or reduction and compare it to that of nicotine replacement terapia (NRT). This was a single-center, non-randomized control, prospective, longitudinal clinical study conducted at the Policlinic of Duque de Caxias, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Recruitment occurred in 2019 with 39 participants treated exclusively with nicotine patches (control group), and in 2023 with 40 participants receiving heteroisotherapic homeopathic tratamento (test group). The homeopathic intervenção was personalized, and each participant was treated with the smoke extracted from their addictive cigarette using the Isomaker® apparatus. The HOM group used three tablets in the morning and evening and one tablet before each urge to smoke for 90 days. The Nicotine group had used nicotine patches for 90 days. Inclusion criteria were being at least 18 years old, both sexes, wanting to quit smoking, and being a current smoker. Exclusion criteria were being a passive smoker or an ex-smoker. The primary resultado was smoking tobacco cessation. Secondary resultados were a reduction in tobacco dependence and adverse events. Although no statistically significant difference was observed between the groups for the primary resultado (p = 0.165, Fisher's exact test), the findings suggest that the HOM intervenção may be as effective as nicotine replacement terapia (NRT) for smoking cessation. While abstinence rates were higher in the NRT group (76%) compared to the HOM group (57.6%), this difference did not reach statistical significance and may be attributed to the limited sample size. These preliminary results support the potential of HOM as a viable alternative for the tratamento of tobacco use disorder. Further research with larger, randomized, and multicentre trials is warranted to confirm these findings and strengthen the evidence base. Homeopathic tratamento has shown potential as a safe approach to help reduce or quit smoking. The project is currently ongoing within the saúde pública system, and the preliminary results presented to date are encouraging, paving the way for further studies.

    "abstract": "This research is carried out in the Indigenous Reservation of Toribío, Cauca, where the Nasa people, under the Indigenous System of Self and Intercultural Health (SISPI), combine ancestral knowledge with Western medicine to defend their cultural identity. Traditional preconception care has been little documented, leading women to access biomedical programs that often overlook their ancestral practices and result in undesirable side effects. For the Nasa people, health is understood as an integral balance between the body, spirit, environment, and community, in contrast to the medicalization of reproductive health. Globalization has weakened the transmission of this knowledge, causing reproductive disharmonies. However, the rise of integrative medicine creates opportunities to revalue these practices. The communitys limited access to biomedical services reinforces the need to integrate traditional preconception care into saúde pública programs to provide more culturally appropriate and preventive care. This study seeks to make these practices visible, strengthen community autonomy, and contribute to intercultural health dialogue and to more inclusive and sustainable saúde pública policies. Based on the above, the general objective of this study is to analyze ancestral practices and perceptions of Nasa traditional healers and midwives in the Indigenous Reservation of Toribío, Cauca, regarding preconception care. The research carried out in the Toribío Indigenous Reserve gathered valuable information on the Nasa peoples preconception care practices through semi-structured interviews and a focus group. Traditional knowledge holdersincluding Thê wala, midwives, healers, and experts in medicinal plantsactively participated, helping to identify elements that validate and strengthen these ancestral practices, which are deeply rooted in their holistic worldview. A chain sampling or snowball methodology was used to select participants, with support from the E.S.E. CXAYUCE JXUT. In total, six individuals were interviewed (four midwives/ancestral knowledge holders and two traditional doctors), and the focus group brought together six key actors, including traditional doctors, midwives, ancestral knowledge holders, and community leaders. The findings showed that Nasa preconception care integrates physical, spiritual, and community dimensions, emphasizing the importance of rituals and ancestral knowledge to balance the uterus and prevent complications. The traditional diet, based on arracacha, plantain, and local protein sources, reflects not only a worldview of harmony with nature but also aligns with key nutrients (iron, folic acid) recognized by biomedicine as essential at this stage. However, younger generations tend to underestimate these ancestral practices due to external influences, exacerbating reproductive \"disharmonies.\" The studys conclusions underscore the urgency of recognizing, respecting, and validating this ancestral knowledge in public policies and health programs, promoting its effective articulation with the Indigenous System of Intercultural and Autonomous Health (SISPI). Nasa medicine offers a holistic and preventive approach that, if strengthened, could contribute significantly to reducing gestational complications, reinforcing community autonomy, and building a health model that prioritizes the balance between body, spirit, and territory as the foundation of buen vivir (good living).",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic was marked by thousands of deaths, together with a worn-out healthcare system in the absence, or limited, efetividade of conventional therapeutic resources. Most individuals exhibited mild to moderate respiratory symptoms1. Observing that scenario, some homeopaths initiated the Homeopathy COVID-19 Urgent Solidarity Action to provide free and remote appointments. Homeopathy has been part of the Brazilian public healthcare system since the 1980s. It is included in the National Policy on Integrative and Complementary Practices (PNPIC) within the Unified Health System (SUS). The use of these methods has already been demonstrated in previous papers as effective in other historical epidemics, such as Yellow Fever, Spanish Flu, Diphtheria, Typhoid Fever, Dengue, Chikungunya, and Cholera, and to COVID-19 pandemic. This prospective study aims to: (i) identify the homeopathic remedies prescribed; and (ii) identify the most frequently reported symptoms. This prospective observational study, conducted from 2021 to 2022, was approved by the Research Ethics Committee on Human Subjects (CAAE: 50104521.1.0000.5506, Approval No.: 5.009.104). Participants filled out a consensual form with personal data via the Internet. All teams were made up of professional volunteers who assisted the patients into four classified groups: NC (Non-COVID)  promoção da saúde; DC (During COVID)  active infection; PC (Post-COVID)  persistent symptoms; VC (Vaccine-related symptoms)  reactions following immunization. Pharmacies supported the project by donating homeopathic medicines to various potencies. Coroninum, like other vaccine-based medicines, was prepared according to the Brazilian Homeopathic Pharmacopoeias biotherapic method. The first, was derived from oropharyngeal secretions of COVID-19-positive individuals and potentized through serial 1:100 dilutions (Hahnemannian centesimal scale) with 100 succussions. The distribution of participants among groups was NC  40.7%, DC  33.3%, VC  16.1%, and PC  9.9%. Most individuals seeking assistance (40.7%) had no comorbidities or risk factors. Most prescribed homeopathic remedies and frequently reported symptoms per group were: (i) NC  Coroninum and Arsenicum album for general promoção da saúde; (ii) DC  China officinalis (14.8%), Arsenicum album (11.1%), and Coroninum (7.4%). Symptoms: fatigue, nasal congestion, cough, myalgia, sore throat, headache; (iii) PC  China officinalis (25%), Coroninum (25%), Arsenicum album (12.5%), Cocculus indicus (12.5%), Natrum muriaticum (12.5%), and Thuya officinalis (12.5%). Symptoms: fatigue, myalgia, dyspnea; (iv) VC  AstraZeneca vaccine isoterapia (38.5%), Arsenicum album (23%), Camphora (23%), Coronavac vaccine isoterapia (7.7%), Pfizer vaccine isoterapia (7.7%). Symptoms: headache. According to homeopathic principles, the evaluation is personal, because symptoms represent the body's response to disease and the imbalance of vital energy. The Coroninum biotherapic was the most frequently prescribed due to its correspondence with the diseases causative agent. Arsenicum album got second place, not just as a result of its similarity to respiratory symptoms but because of its recognition by the Indian Ministry of Health as a primary homeopathic remedy for COVID-19. Homeopathy is an integrative and complementary practice that has been used in past epidemics and was also one of the therapeutic options available during the COVID-19 pandemic, with research publications. The remedies were selected based on individualized symptoms, including Coroninum biotherapic and the classic Arsenicum album.",

    "abstract": "Currently, cancer is one of the leading causes of disease in the world. According to the International Agency for Research on Cancer, in 2012 there were 14.1 million new cases of cancer and 32.6 million pre-existing cases, with 8.2 million deaths. It is predicted that by 2035, there will be approximately 24.0 million new cases and 14.6 million deaths.This rise in the cancer incidence is attributable to the continuous advances in tratamento, which have led to more patients living with this disease. Consequently, there is an increasing demand for effective palliative care strategies. In this context, acupuntura and its therapies, such as moxibustion and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, emerge as promising tratamento options, as there is evidence of its use for reducing symptoms commonly seen in cancer patients, such as cancer-related pain, fatigue, and reduced qualidade de vida. These intervençãos can provide a non-invasive and effective alternative for symptom management, seeking to attribute dignity and humanity to patients throughout their care.The objective of this review is to evaluate the efetividade of acupuntura in providing symptom relief and improving the qualidade de vida for palliative care cancer patients. A functional search strategy was established in the Medline and BvSalud databases using the keywords Acupuncture Therapy and Palliative Care, retrieving 124 articles. The results were imported to Rayyan, where duplicates were excluded, and the selection of included articles was performed by the authors of this study in a blinded manner. The inclusion criteria were restricted to Randomized Clinical Trial or Systematic Review, while the exclusion criteria consisted of any other study design or non-oncological patients in palliative care. After the selection was completed, the authors resolved conflicts by consensus and began data extraction using a standardized extraction protocol, followed by the full reading of the articles and the preparation of the integrative review. Finally, the writing of this work was carried out based on the obtained results. Slightly stronger effects were found in the acupuntura and related care group compared to isolated conventional care (pooled RR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.13 to 1.64). At the same time, no statistical differences were found between acupuntura or conventional analgesic tratamento (pooled RR, 1.12; 95% CI, 0.98 to 1.28). Regarding cancer-related fatigue, acupuntura with patient education significantly reduced fatigue compared to conventional tratamento (two RCTs; pooled SMD, 2.12; 95% CI, 3.21 to 1.03). Finally, regarding qualidade de vida, it was found that acupuntura improves the qualidade de vida in lung cancer patients compared to conventional care alone (pooled SMD, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.04 to 0.90). In summary, acupuntura and its related therapies have shown favorable therapeutic effects for the management of some cancer-associated complications. However, there is conflicting and insufficient evidence to support or refute the indiscriminate use of acupuntura in oncological patients in palliative care.",

    "abstract": "Lateral epicondylitis, or tennis elbow, is a pathology that affects men and women between the ages of 35 and 55, equally. Although it suggests inflammation, epicondylitis is actually related to lesions in the short radial extensor tendons of the wrist due to repetitive movements such as using computers, cash registers, playing piano, painting, carpentry, screw turning and weightlifting. This disorder is characterized by pain in the lateral epicondyle of the humerus and pain during dorsiflexion, which can compromise daily activities and reduce productivity. It can persist for 6 to 24 months, with 90% of patients recovering within 1 year, while 3 to 10% possibly experiencing chronic symptoms and necessitating surgery. The annual incidence is 4 to 7 per 1000 inhabitants, affecting 1 to 3% of the population, representing a high financial cost. Treatment consists in resting, anti-inflammatory medication and physioterapia. Currently, acupuntura, a Chinese medicine terapia, is promising because it involves stimulating body points through needle insertion, which releases endorphins and enkephalins that reduces pain. It is a quick, effective tratamento without the contraindications and efeitos adversos of anti-inflammatories, such as nausea, vomiting, bleeding, and kidney injuries. The objective of this review is to determine the efetividade of acupuntura in treating adults with lateral epicondylitis. A thorough search methodology was employed in the Medline and Lilacs databases with the terms Acupuncture Therapy and Tennis Elbow, retrieving 123 articles, sifted through Rayyan to exclude duplicates. Through a blind selection process, two researchers independently chose the most relevant studies. The inclusion criteria were restricted to Randomized Clinical Trials or Systematic Reviews relating to adult patients with lateral epicondylitis. Other types of studies or disorders besides lateral epicondylitis were omitted. Any conflicting views were reconciled by reaching a consensus. The researchers proceeded with systematic data collection following an established protocol and conducted a comprehensive review of the texts, resulting in the development of an integrative review. Some randomized ensaio clínicos showed that needle acupuntura provides pain relief for a significantly longer period than placebo (MD = 18.8 hours, 95% CI 10.1 to 27.5) and a higher probability of reducing pain by 50% or more (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.69) (Molsberger 1994). Another ensaio clínico revealed that needle acupuntura is more likely to improve overall pain in the short term than placebo (RR +0.09%, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.64) and that there are no significant differences in the long term (after 3 or 12 months). Another randomized ensaio clínico comparing laser acupuntura to placebo demonstrated no differences regarding overall benefit. And a trial conducted in China found no difference between vitamin B12 injection with acupuntura and vitamin B12 injections alone. The analysis of the results shows evidence suggesting that acupuntura is effective in relieving pain caused by lateral epicondylitis and that it appears to be superior to drug terapia in some cases. Despite the published studies, further research regarding long-term tratamento would be important to make an absolute recommendation about its use.",

    "abstract": "Yoga is a multimodal practice dating back to at least 2700 BC and originated in India, where it was described as stabilizing the sensory organs. Yoga is commonly used as a form of exercise that combines physical postures with breathing exercises and meditação. Participation in yoga-based practices has increased in recent decades, as has research. There is evidence that the health benefits of yoga-based intervençãos are comparable to those of aerobic exercise. Yoga is also hypothesized to improve mental and cognitive health. Governments in various countries have implemented different saúde pública strategies to address the issue of mental health in older adults. Therefore, the objective of this research is to analyze the existing literature on the efetividade of yoga on mental health in older adults. The study design was a scoping review, and the PRISMA-Scr (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension) methodology was used to design the protocol. All types of study designs and reviews were included, and the publication period was limited from June 2015 to June 2025. To be included in the review, articles had to focus on specific dimensions: population: older adults, concept: yoga terapia, and context: mental health problems. No language restrictions were imposed; publications in English or Spanish were included. Search strategies were designed to collect information from the following databases: Medline/PubMed, LILACS, and The Cochrane Library. In addition, searches were conducted in BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine , Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine, International Journal of Yoga, and Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine. The study selection process was conducted independently by two reviewers using the Rayyan electronic platform (https://www.rayyan.ai) and was supervised by one of them. To this end, the references identified in each database were consolidated, and duplicate records were removed using this electronic platform. The identification, selection of records or articles, eligibility, and details of the selection process were presented using the PRISMA flowchart. . The results were summarized descriptively. The search yielded 1,181 results, of which 30 were potentially retrieved articles that met the eligibility criteria. Two revisão sistemáticas were included, following the eligibility criteria. Sleep problems, depressão, and ansiedade were the most common mental health problems, followed by qualidade de vida, cognitive function, self-esteem, physical performance, and several others. The available literature shows that yoga-based intervençãos offer a beneficial impact on improving sleep problems, ansiedade, and depressão in older adults. However, the methodological heterogeneity of the studies in terms of type of yoga practice, duration, and measurement tools limits the generalization of results. We suggest conducting methodologically rigorous randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to consolidate evidence of their efetividade for future applications in clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "The gut microbiota plays a significant role in the occurrence and progression of cancer, influencing host metabolism, immune regulation, and therapeutic response. Emerging research suggests that microbial metabolites may function as bioactive compounds in cancer prevenção and tratamento, aligning with the holistic approaches of Traditional and Complementary Medicine (TCIM). This study evaluates the anticancer potential of three gut microbiota-derived metabolitessodium butyrate, inosine, and nisinagainst breast cancer cell lines. The antiproliferative effects of the metabolites were assessed in vitro against two breast adenocarcinoma cell lines: MCF7 (estrogen receptor-positive) and MDA-MB-231 (triple-negative). Normal human breast epithelial cells (MCF10A) were included to assess cytotoxic selectivity. Cell viability was measured using the Alamar Blue assay. Apoptotic activity and reactive oxygen species (ROS) inhibition were evaluated via flow cytometry and ROS assays, respectively. Proteomics profiling was conducted using label-free nano-LC-MS/MS to determine molecular mechanisms in MCF7 cells. Sodium butyrate demonstrated the highest antiproliferative activity with IC values of 576 g/mL (MCF7) and 557 g/mL (MDA-MB-231). Inosine showed moderate cytotoxicity, while nisin exhibited limited activity. All three compounds significantly induced apoptosis and reduced ROS levels in both cancer cell lines. Proteomics analysis revealed that sodium butyrate modulated stress and hormonal signaling pathwayssuch as HSF1-mediated heat shock response and estrogen-dependent gene expressionwhile inosine and nisin primarily impacted cell cycle regulation. These findings support the therapeutic potential of gut microbial metabolites, particularly sodium butyrate and inosine, as adjunctive agents in breast cancer management. Their selective cytotoxicity, sparing normal epithelial cells, reinforces their promise as safer alternatives or complements to conventional cancer therapies. The observed molecular mechanisms provide further justification for their inclusion in TCIM frameworks. Gut microbial metabolites offer a novel, evidence-informed approach to breast cancer terapia. This study contributes to the growing validation of microbiota-based intervençãos within saúde pública and TCIM, highlighting their role in addressing complex clinical conditions with biological precision and reduced toxicity.",

    "abstract": "Our objective is to elucidate the reciprocal association between atopic dermatitis(AD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) by prespecified subgroups and determinepotential modified factors. Atopic dermatitis (AD),a pervasive chronic inflamma.tory skin disease, afflicts roughly 20% of children and10% of adults . According to the latest data fromthe Global Burden of Disease 2019,AD continues tocause significant global morbidity from 1990 to 2019. Due to its intense itching and recurrent eczema.tous lesions, it has contributed to an adverse increasein neuropsychiatric issues including depressão, atten-tion deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and suicidaideation. Among them, ADHD ranks as the pre.dominant neurodevelopmental disorder among chil.dren [5], with a global prevalence exceeding 5%.Given the escalating saúde pública burden of ADand ADHD,systematically clarifying this bidirectionalrelationship is crucial for improving patient screening,tratamento, and preventive strategies. Therefore, in thismetanálise, our objectives are threefold: (1) to eluci-date the bidirectional association between AD andADHD in both pediatric and adult populations; (2) toassess the influence of potential moderating factors(whether age, AD severity and other comorbiditieswould affect the results); and (3) to ascertain the prev-alence regardless of AD as either exposure or resultadovariables. Adhering to PRISMA 2020, we conducted a comprehensive databasesearch up until March 11, 2024. 0bservational studies reporting on AD and ADHD as eithelexposure or resultado variables were included. A random-effects model metanálise wasconducted to calculate pooled estimates. Subgroup and meta-regression analyses were undertakento explore heterogeneity. Publication bias was investigated via funnel plots and Egger's test. Overall, 49 studies were determined to meet the inclusion criteria after rigorous screeningPatients with AD were more ikely to have ADHD (ORs = 1.34,95% C1.25-1.44, D<0.01: HRS 1.42, 95% C1 1.20-1.68, p<0.01), while patients with ADHD also had an increased risk of developincAD (ORs= 1.45,95% C 1.21-1.73, p<0.01). Subgroup analyses indicated that the associationswere particularly pronounced among studies that assessed patients with severe AD (ORs = 2.6295% C1 1.76-3.92,p<0.01), suffered from multiple allergic conditions (ORs = 2.89, 95% C1 1.18-7.10,p<0.01)and sleep disturbances (ORs = 2.43,95% Cl 2.14-2.76,p<0.01) simultaneously.This revisão sistemática rigorously examines existingevidence concerning the bidirectional associationbetween AD and ADHD within observational studies.Our analysis revealed that individuals with AD have a1.34-fold increased risk of developing ADHD. Moreover,our analysis also found that the prevalence of AD andthe risk of its development were elevated in patientswith ADHD, suggesting a potential bidirectional associ-ation between AD and ADHD.Thus, there is apressing need for further research in adult cohorts toimprove diagnosis and management. Additionally, significan p typically generated by large-scale researchunderscores the inherent limitation of meta-analysesbased on observational studies. This metanálise indicates the reciprocal relationshipbetween AD and ADHD. The study emphasizes theimportance of interdisciplinary consultations to inte.grate these findings into clinical practice, thus improving mental healthcare and preventing healthdeterioration. Furthermore, to enhance physicians' abil-.ity to identify ilnesses early and develop effective preventive plans, standardization of diagnostic criteriaand additional research into mediating variables areneeded, especially in individuals with severe AD mani.)problems, and multiple allergicfestations, sleepdiseases.",

    "abstract": "Reiki is a care practice systematized by Mikao Usui at the beginning of the last century and recognized in Brazil in 2017 by Ordinance MS No. 849, as an Integrative and Complementary Health Practice (PICs). It is characterized by the imposition of hands with the aim of restoring physical, mental and spiritual balance, and given the growing adoption of this practice in various care contexts, it becomes necessary to investigate its impact on the routine of individuals, especially with regard to promoting well-being and strengthening self-care, thus justifying the relevance of this study. Given this, the question emerged: What is the impact of the regular application of Reiki in daily life Guiding this work through the following objective: To report the impact of the regular application of Reiki in daily life. This study addresses the following research question: What are the effects of regular Reiki practice on daily life We present a qualitativo study documenting the authors' participation in a weekly Reiki practice group. This Reiki group, affiliated with the Center for Studies and Research in Homeopathy and Phytoterapia at the Federal University of Paraíba, has been operating continuously since 2018. Data collection occurred through a focus group session during one of the regular meetings at April of 2025, facilitated by a trained moderator. Participant responses were transcribed and analyzed using Atlas.ti software to identify common themes, which were subsequently organized into two thematic categories. This research is part of a larger study approved by the Ethics Research Committee (CAAE: 79750424.4.0000.8069). Our analysis after transcription and coding revealed two primary thematic categories: TC1  \"Emotional Awareness; TC2  \"Self-Regulation and Enhanced Relationships\". Discussion: The focus group participants reported various perceived benefits of Reiki, with responses coded alphanumerically for analysis. Key findings for TC1 included statements such as: \"Reiki helps me stay more present and aware \"; \"I notice my breathing becomes deeper and calmer \"; \"It consistently brings me a sense of peace \"; These observations support existing literature on Reiki's role in promoting emotional consciousness. For TC2, significant responses were: \"It facilitates a journey of self-discovery ; \"I've come to recognize this energy within myself ; \"I find myself being more thoughtful, less judgmental, and more understanding of others \". These reports align with PAHO (2023) documentation on how energy therapies can contribute to interpersonal connection, mindful communication, and emotional support. Our initial findings suggest that consistent Reiki practice may lead to meaningful improvements in practitioners' qualidade de vida. The identified themes demonstrate Reiki's value as a Complementary Therapy that supports emotional equilibrium, self-knowledge, and social connectedness. These results underscore the need for additional research to further establish Reiki's efetividade and solidify its position as a valuable therapeutic approach among Complementary Therapies.",

    "abstract": "Chronic lower extremity ulcers (CLEUs) remain a major clinical challenge due to their prolonged healing process and risk of amputation. Stem cell terapia (SCT) has emerged as a promising regenerative strategy, with various cell types being explored for their efficacy in treating CLEUs. This umbrella review aims to consolidate the existing evidence on stem cell intervençãos for DCM, providing a comprehensive overview of the current research landscape. CLEUs encompassing both leg ulcers and foot ulcers, are a common clinical problem, affecting approximately 1 to 2% of adults in the United States. The predominant etiologies comprise venous insufficiency, diabetes mellitus (DM), peripheral arterial disease (PAD), and pressure injury. It is well-recognized that chronic ulcers associated with diabetic foot, peripheral arterial ischemia, or venous thrombotic disease often exhibit a prolonged disease course, posing significant challenges to effective wound management. Failure to achieve timely healing may result in serious complications, including infection, necrosis, and even sepsis, ultimately resulting in amputation or mortality. Notably, nearly 70% of amputations have been attributed to non-healing wounds. This situation imposes a considerable burden not only on patients' qualidade de vida but also on healthcare systems, with annual costs associated with venous leg ulcers and diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) estimated at $14.9 billion and $9-13 billion, respectively. Therefore, developing novel therapeutic approaches for chronic or refractory lower extremity ulcers is urgently required. This umbrella review was conducted following the PRIOR and PRISMA guidelines. We searched across PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases for revisão sistemáticas (SRs) and meta-analyses (MAs) that included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on SCT for CLEUs from inception to 3 March 2025. The methodological quality and evidence quality of the SRs/MAs were assessed by AMSTAR 2 and GRADE. A quantitative synthesis of all RCTs included in the SRs/MAs to obtain objective and updated conclusions. A total of 28 SRs/MAs involving 72 RCTs were included, though the methodological quality and evidence quality were generally unsatisfactory. Our updated metanálise indicated that SCT provided potential therapeutic benefits for CLEUs, as indicated by efetividade in measures, including healing rate, ulcer size reduction, complete healing time, amputation rate, ankle-brachial index, transcutaneous oxygen pressure, new angiogenesis rate, pain-free walking distance, rest pain score, amputation-free survival, and all-cause mortality. This umbrella review synthesizes evidence from existing SRs/MAs to evaluate the efficacy and segurança of SCT for CLEUs. Despite advances in medical management, the tratamento of CLEUs remains a significant clinical challenge. Recently, SCT has shown great promise in the field of regenerative medicine48, particularly for the tratamento of chronic skin ulcers secondary to DM or peripheral vascular diseases. SCT represents a promising adjunctive terapia for CLEUs, with many studies demonstrating its segurança and potential benefits. However, current evidence is limited by methodological flaws and study heterogeneity. High-quality RCTs in the future are crucial to truly proving the benefits of SCT for CLEUs.",

    "abstract": "Distal radius fracture (DRF) represents one of the most common fracture of the upper extremities, yet optimal manage strategy remains debated. Manual reduction with splint fixation (MRSF), as a traditional Chinese medicine approach, has been applied for treating DRF for centuries. There is still a lack of rigorous evidence regarding its efetividade, segurança, and cost-efetividade. Five Chinese databases (Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure [CNKI], China Science and Technology Journal Database [VIP], Sinomed, Yiigle Database, and Wanfang Database) and five international databases (PubMed, EMBase, the Cochrane Library, Epistemonikos and Web of Science Core Collection) were searched from inception until 20 February, 2025 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Studies comparing MRSF with surgical tratamento in adult DRF were eligible. The primary resultado were the wrist function and adverse events. The secondary resultados included qualidade de vida and economic resultados. The Cochrane risk of bias (RoB) 2.0 tool and the GRADE approach were used to assess the certainty of the evidence. A metanálise was performed via RevMan 5.4.1 software. Thirty-four RCTs with 3493 participants were included. The overall RoB of included studies was some concerns to high. In general, the certainty of evidence was rated as low to moderate. The wrist function was assessed using eight different validated scales across the included studies. Compared to open reduction with internal fixation (ORIF), MRSF showed significant improvement in the early three months (Cooney score: MD 20.62, 95% CI 16.83 to 24.21, 2 RCTs, 189 participants; Mayo score: MD 1.08, 95% CI 4.18 to 2.03, 2 RCTs, 126 participants; Dienst score: MD 7.23, 95% CI 9.68 to 4.78, 1 RCT, 63 participants). MRSF was also associated with significantly lower tratamento cost (MD 24.66 thousand yuan, 95%CI 26.25 to 23.07, 2 RCTs, 328 participants). Compared to K-wire fixation, MRSF demonstrated a higher excellent rate assessed by Gartland-Werley score and better qualidade de vida at 3 months. No significant harms were observed in relation to MRSF. Although MRSF appears to be a promising cost effective modality, the absence of standardized operational procedures limits its broader adoption. Further large-scale prospective studies are still required to confirm its benefits and harms and support the development of MRSF guidelines.",

    "abstract": "Aplastic anemia (AA) is a bone marrow failure disorder caused by hematopoietic stem cell injury, abnormal microenvironment, and immune dysregulation. Severe AA shows acute onset with high mortality from hemorrhage/infection without timely intervenção. China's annual incidence is 7.4/106, with a 1.18:1 male-to-female ratio and an elderly incidence peak. Western medicine uses immunosuppressive terapia, stem cell transplantation, etc., but faces challenges like toxicity, transfusion dependency, and high costs. In TCM, AA is \"sui lao,\" treated by tonifying kidney/spleen, resolving phlegm/stasis, and detoxification. TCM improves symptoms, regulates immunity, and reduces side effects. However, TCM RCTs for AA have non-standardized syndrome diagnostic criteria, inconsistent efficacy evaluation standards, varied resultado measures, and lack of TCM-specific indicators. Core resultado sets (COS) standardize research, but a universal TCM COS for AA is missing, requiring analysis of current resultado measure practices. This article analyzes the current status of the use of resultado measures in RCTs of TCM for AA, providing a reference for the construction of a COS for TCM tratamento of AA. A comprehensive literature search was conducted in databases including China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKl), WanFang Data, PubMed, CochraneLibrary, and Embase databases. Additionally, relevant studies were identified through the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR) and ClinicalTrials.gov. Studies were sereened according to inclusion criteria, the risk of bias was assessed, and the usage of various resultado measures was statistically analyzed. A total of 326 RCTs were included, with sample sizes ranging from 5 to 1222 cases, reporting a total of 198 resultado measures with a cumulative application frequency of 2020 times. Outcome measures were categorized into seven domains based on functional attributes: TCM syndromes, symptoms and signs, laboratory tests, qualidade de vidalong-term prognosis, economic evaluation, and segurança events. Efficacy rate and TCM syndrome scores were identified as high-frequency resultado measures (reported 302 and 52 times, respectively), which are primary choices for core resultado measures in TCM tratamento of AA. Secondly, considerations should include TCM syndrome efficacy rate, adverse reactions, qualidade de vida scores, and survival quality. RCTs of TCM tratamento for AA exhibit issues such as non-standardized diagnostic criteria for TCM syndromes, inconsistent clinical efficacy evaluation standards, a plethora of resultado measures with significant variations in their frequency and application, and a deficiency of TCMs characteristic resultado measures. Establishing a COS for TCM tratamento of AA is crucial for advancing TCM clinical research and will have a profound impact on the field.",

    "abstract": "This study investigates the effect of a TCM emotion regulation intervenção on functional dyspepsia (FD) using response-adaptive randomization. FD pathogenesis is linked to emotional factors; TCM theory posits that regulating emotions improves visceral function, including digestion. The research employs response-adaptive randomization to tailor TCM emotion regulation strategies to individual patient characteristics and needs. It evaluates intervenção efetividade, analyzes key technologies, and aims to deepen understanding of the intervenção's mechanisms. Integrating TCM theory with modern techniques, this approach seeks to provide more effective therapies to improve FD patients' qualidade de vida and recovery. This study is a prospective, randomized, controlled ensaio clínico. The foundational tratamento in the Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) group utilizes the Xiangxia Formula. The experimental group receives the TCM Xiangxia Formula tratamento combined with TCM emotion regulation intervenção. Subsequently, the randomization allocation probabilities are updated using the response-adaptive randomization method. The herbal formula used in this study is Xiangxia Formula. Its core herbal components include: Huoxiang (, Pogostemon cablin), Xiangfu (, Cyperus rotundus), Banzhilian (, Scutellaria barbata), Qingbanxia (, Processed Pinellia ternata), Baihe (, Lilium brownii), Wuyao (, Lindera aggregata), Houpo (, Magnolia officinalis bark), Zhishi (, Immature fruit of Citrus × aurantium), Jianghuang (, Curcuma longa rhizome). Countries of Use: As a clinically empirical formula, Xiangxia Formula is primarily used within the Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) healthcare systems in China and among Chinese communities worldwide. TCM emotion regulation intervençãos include: 1. Psychological Care: Establish a supportive nurse-patient relationship through active communication. Listen attentively to emotional distress and apply tailored emotion-regulating techniques based on individual emotional states. 2. Five-Element Music Therapy: Play soft, soothing music selected according to TCM Five-Element theory to promote relaxation and reduce negative emotions. 3. Psychological Counseling: Guide patients to release inner pressure through appropriate channels. Cultivate optimistic emotional attitudes. 4. Mindfulness Training & Relaxation Therapy: Play calming background music while instructing patients in breathing techniques to alleviate psychological stress. Utilize deep breathing and meditação to maintain mental equilibrium. Results are not yet available as participant recruitment is pending. The primary endpoint is the response rate at week 4 post-tratamento. Secondary endpoints include response rates at weeks 8, 12, and 16. Patient data will be recorded for primary efficacy measures, secondary efficacy measures, and segurança measures. This study aims to clarify the efficacy and segurança of response-adaptive randomization-based TCM emotion regulation intervenção for patients with functional dyspepsia (FD).Key resultados include tratamento efficacy (symptom improvement), segurança profiles (adverse events), and performance of the response-adaptive randomization algorithm. This study aims to evaluate whether integrating TCM emotion regulation with Xiangxia Formula improves resultados for functional dyspepsia versus herbal tratamento alone. By utilizing response-adaptive randomization, we seek to ethically optimize participant allocation based on early efficacy signals. Results will clarify the incremental value and segurança of this combined TCM approach. If effective, it could provide a novel, personalized strategy for FD management, harmonizing traditional herbal terapia with baseado em evidence psychological intervenção. The adaptive design may also inform efficient methodologies for future TCM integrative research.",

    "abstract": "Sepsis is a life-threatening organ dysfunction from dysregulated host response to infection. In China, ~30% of sepsis patients develop ARDS, with a 20%-50% worldwide mortality rate. The 2020 Expert Consensus requires sepsis-ARDS diagnosis to meet Sepsis 3.0 and the 2012 Berlin Definition. The 2023 Chinese guidelines updated criteria by including SpO2/FiO2. Current tratamento relies on supportive care, but mortality remains high. In TCM, ARDS is \"Chuan Zheng,\" with toxins, stasis, heat, and phlegm as key pathologies. TCM's efficacy in treating sepsis-ARDS has been confirmed. RCTs are the gold standard for clinical evaluation, and core resultado sets (COS) standardize essential indicators. Constructing a COS for TCM tratamento helps reduce resultado measure heterogeneity, enabling pooled analysis and higher-level evidence. This paper investigates resultado indicators in TCM RCTs for sepsis-ARDS, analyzes issues, and informs COS development. Comprehensive literature searches were conducted in databases such as China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKl), Wanfang Data, PubMed, CochraneLibrary and Embase. Furthermore, the relevant studies were identified through the Chinese ClinicalTrial Registry (ChiCTR) and ClinicalTrials.gov. According to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, randomized controlled trials of traditional Chinese medicine in the tratamento of septicemic ARDS were screened, and the use of various resultado indicators was statistically analyzed. A total of 83 RCTs and 7 ensaio clínico registration schemes were included in this study, reporting 186 resultado indicators in total, which were classified into seven domains according to functional attributes: qualidade de vida, laboratory tests, TCM patterns, symptoms and signs, long-term prognosis, economic evaluation, and segurança events. Laboratory test indicators accounted for the highest proportion (128 items), covering inflammatory factors, arterial blood gas analysis, pulmonary function, etc. The TCM pattern domain involved 26 TCM syndrome types (mainly intestinal heat and stomach excess syndrome, Yangming stomach excess syndrome), as well as TCM symptom scores and syndrome efficacy evaluation. Long-term prognosis indicators included 28-day mortality rate, ICU length of stay, etc., while economic evaluation indicators only accounted for 2.22%. The study also found problems such as poor consistency in diagnostic criteria (sepsis diagnosis was clarified in 77.78%, ARDS diagnosis in 73.33%, and there were 25 TCM diagnostic criteria), inconsistency in efficacy evaluation criteria (6 criteria for clinical efficacy and 3 criteria for TCM syndrome efficacy), great heterogeneity in the selection and measurement of resultado indicators, and insufficient TCM-specific indicators. There are many issues with the current use of resultado indicators. Therefore, it is essential to construct a COS for the TCM tratamento of sepsis-induced ARDS. This will assist clinical researchers in selecting resultado indicators more reasonably and reflect the distinctive advantages of TCM in treating critical severe diseases.",

    "abstract": "Kaelins blood test is an ascending paper chromatography technique using whole blood hemolysate as the stationary phase and water as the mobile phase. This study aimed to investigate whether an individually prescribed homeopathic remedy, along with two preselected remedies, influences chromatographic patterns compared to a placebo. EDTA blood samples were collected from 13 patients, each prescribed an individual homeopathic remedy. The impact of the individual remedy, Natrium muriaticum and Pulsatilla (in the same potency, 30 or 200c) vs. placebo globules on human blood in vitro was tested by means of Kaelins blood test; the tested globules were added to both the stationary and mobile phases. The robustness of the experimental system was evaluated through systematic control experiments. Chromatographic images were scanned, and colour distribution was analyzed using ImageJ software. Data were statistically evaluated using two-way ANOVA with independent factors: patient and tratamento. The study was approved by the local ethics committee. Highly significant differences in colour distribution were observed across patients, with some differences also found between tratamentos and potencies. A significant interaction between patient and tratamento suggests that the effect of homeopathic remedies is individual-specific and varies among donors. Most responsive samples came from patients with acute conditions. Our study shows that the chromatographic Kaelin blood test is sensitive to homeopathic globules added to human blood hemolysates in vitro, and that the effects produced by the remedies on the blood patterns are blood donor specific, thus individual. Kaelins blood test appears to be a promising tool for basic research in homeopatia and may have potential as a method for monitoring tratamento efficacy. These findings support the need for further studies to explore the tests full capabilities.",

    "abstract": "Meditation has been integral to religious traditions such as Buddhism, Daoism, Hinduism, and Christianity for millennia. In recent decades, meditação and atenção plena-based intervençãos (MBIs) have gained scientific and clinical relevance. Evidence supports their efficacy in conditions like depressão, ansiedade, stress, insomnia, addiction, psychosis, pain, and cancer-related symptoms. Regular practice has also been associated with reductions in diastolic blood pressure. However, the acute cardiovascular effects of meditação in older adults remain unclear. This study aims to explore immediate physiological changes during meditação in elderly participants. This exploratory study consists of two independent n=1 trials, conducted in parallel, involving one participant with long-term meditação experience (LME) and one with no meditação experience (NME). Eligible participants were aged 70+ with typical geriatric multimorbidity or over 80 years. During the whole session, both participants were sitting in a relaxed meditação position . Each session began with a five-minute baseline phase (T0), while they quietly contemplated a painting, followed by over five minutes of paced breathing to standardize cardiovascular parameters. The core meditação phase lasted at least 30 minutes and could be adjusted by the participant using predefined hand signals. A final paced breathing phase served as a washout period. Primary resultados included cardiovascular parameters: heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP), pulse transit time (PTT), and perfusion index (PI). We enrolled one participant (male, 78 years) with long-term meditação experience (LME), who is a Tai Chi instructor with approximately 50 years of meditação practice and one no meditação-experienced (NME) participant (male, 80 years) of comparable health status, and multimorbidity profile. Regarding the differences between baseline (T0) and meditação status (T1), results show a HR decrease in both participants (mean±SD: LME- T0: 69.1±8.1, T1: 67.4±4.1; NME- T0: 75.0±1.6, T1: 73.4±3.4), but opposite changes between LME and NME with MAD increase in LME (LME- T0: 111.5±1.8, T1: 120.0±3.7; NME- T0: 109.6±1.7, T1: 105.2±2.2), PTT decrease in LME (LME- T0: 221.8±4.1, T1: 212.3±9.7; NME- T0: 221.7±4.7, T1: 237.0±8.3) and PI decrease in LME (LME- T0: 4.0±1.2, T1: 2.9±0.5; NME T0: 3.0±0.3, T1: 3.5±0.6), indicating a higher sympathetic tone in the vascular system in LME during meditação. To our surprise, we observed a distinct, time-limited increase in cardiovascular activity comparable to that during aerobic exercise  for the participant with long-term meditação experience, despite the subject sitting in complete stillness and outward calm. Certain traditional Asian practices, such as archery or acupuntura, emphasize a paradoxical state of \"relaxation within tension\". This often-overlooked concept in meditação research may help interpret our findings and suggests that such physiological activation could also occur during meditação. In our study, we could demonstrate this phenomenon, indicating a possible extension of the current understanding of meditative states. This may be particularly relevant for older individuals, for whom regular physical training may be limited due to age-related constraints. Such forms of meditação could potentially serve as a substitute, contributing to prevenção and healthy aging. Further research is warranted to explore and validate these novel observations.",

    "abstract": "Cancer remains one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide, underscoring the need for robust data on incidence and tratamento. Cancer registries play a crucial role by systematically collecting and analyzing clinical and demographic information on affected individuals. With the growing use of integrative oncology to improve health resultados and qualidade de vida, identifying predictors of tratamento response is essential for optimizing care. This study investigates such predictors using data from the INTREST registry. INTREST is a prospective cohort study collecting register data at four German certified cancer centers offering integrative cancer therapies. Patient-reported resultados and clinical cancer data of women with pTNM stage I-III breast cancer were collected at the time of diagnosis, after completing neo/adjuvant chemoterapia, after completing adjuvant antihormonal or targeted terapia as well as 1, 2, 5, and 10years after baseline. Endpoints for multivariable prediction models were cancer-related qualidade de vida, fatigue, tratamento adherence, and progression-based resultados/survival. Predictors included the study center, sociodemographic characteristics, histologic cancer and comorbidity data, performance status, stress perception, depressão, ansiedade, sleep quality, spirituality, social support, physical activity, diet behavior, type of conventional tratamentos, and use of and attitudes towards complementary tratamentos. Women were classified as tratamento responders if they were above the 25th percentile of the adult female population for a retrospective resultado and reached the same or higher scores in comparison to their respective baseline values. Women, who scored below the respective 25th percentile of the female US adult population or reported a minimal clinically important worsening, were defined as non-responders. Using a set of bootstrap samples, a random forest classification method was applied to the data to identify relevant predictors for tratamento response or non-response. Based on the data of 1.417 women included, our analyses showed that the analyzed INTREST cohort of women suffering from breast cancer does not significantly differ from population-based registries and pragmatic trial data of breast cancer patients in Germany with respect to main sociodemographic and clinical cancer data. Using the classification criteria, 404 women (28.51%) were defined as responders and 571 (40.30%) as non-responders at 2 years follow-up. Random forest analysis on 500 bootstrapped samples revealed that apart from body mass index (importance: 25.46), age (importance: 21.01) and stress level (importance: 20.17) and CAM Health Beliefs regardless of actual use (importance: 18.92) were important predictors for tratamento response. Identifying predictors for short- and long-term response to integrative breast cancer tratamento is crucial for improving cancer care as well as the quality and quantity of life for patients affected by cancer. Based on the identified predictors, an individualized integrative oncology program  particularly one that includes stress reduction strategies  appears to be useful to enhance tratamento response. Future analyses with more in-depth statistical modeling are planned to gain deeper insights into the characteristics of potential responders and non-responders.",

    "abstract": "Integrative oncology (IO) combines baseado em evidence lifestyle medicine and complementary therapies with standard cancer tratamentos to address patients physical and psychosocial needs. Synthesis Clinic UK offers a medically-led personalised IO outpatient program for patients with cancer used alongside standard of care therapies. This incorporates medical input, nutrition and lifestyle medicine, prehabilitation and rehabilitation, psycho-oncology and other supportive modalities, including but not limited to art and yoga terapia, acupuntura, fitoterapia, mistletoe terapia and loco-regional modulated hyperthermia (mEHT). This study evaluated unmet supportive care needs and how IO approaches could address them among women with breast cancer (BC) and gynaecological cancer (GC) recruited from community support networks and clinic patients. A cross-sectional online survey was conducted in partnership with the National Centre for Integrative Oncology (NCIO) with internal REC (Research Ethics Committee) approval SYN3052025. The 24-item questionnaire assessed demographics, cancer history, and access to information and support related to side effects, menopause, sleep, nutrition, psychological wellbeing, and sexual health with additional 20 questions around integrative care administered to clinic patients. Descriptive analysis was performed. A total of 201 women with breast and gynaecological cancer from the community responded between AprilMay 2025 (96% BC). Most of the BC cohort were White/White British (97.4%), aged 5059 (47.4%) or 6070 (28.7%), highly educated (64.1% university-level), employed (62.5%) and had primary breast cancer (76%). Overall, within the BC cohort undergoing standard care 64.1% were not convinced that they received adequate information to manage illness and side effects, and 72.4% reported not being well-informed about management of tratamento-related side effects. Information on menopause was inadequate or lacking for 77.1%, sleep for 93.2%, exercise for 75.5% and nutrition for 78.1%. Emotional support was insufficient within standard care: 69.3% limited opportunity to discuss concerns, and 82.3% received no support for sexual health. Unmet needs in the GC cohort were similar but worse overall across all the highlighted concerns. In patients who answered questions on IO care (n= 23), the highlighted needs were met to a significantly higher degree. 100% of respondents felt that integrative oncology support was important in their overall care, with over 70% rating it as extremely important. Only 6% were not convinced that they received adequate information to manage illness and side effects, and 4% reported not being well-informed about management of tratamento-related side effects. Information on menopause was not adequate or lacking for 9%, sleep for 13%, exercise for 9% and nutrition for 4%. Regarding emotional support, only 4% limited opportunity to discuss concerns within the integrative oncology clinic setting. Findings highlight considerable unmet needs in breast and gynaecological caners across multiple domains of care. Integration of multidisciplinary medically-led integrative oncology services can help address care gaps and enhance support and is highly valued by breast and gynaecological cancer patients.",

    "abstract": "Biobanks, as precious resources for the realization of translational medicine and precision tratamento, are of great significance for the development of national biomedical scientific research. In 2019, the state issued the Regulations on the Administration of Human Genetic Resources of the Peoples Republic of China, which attracted global attention. And one of the key links in the construction and scientific management process of biobanks is the preliminary ethical review. Ethics is a protective umbrella for effectively ensuring the legal and reasonable operation of biobanks. However, there are currently no unified ethical standards and norms specifically implemented for biobanks in China. How to manage biobanks in a more comprehensive and effective manner regarding ethical issues is worthy of in - depth exploration. Therefore, for the ethical construction of biobanks, it is necessary to explore the current situation of research in this field and clarify the existing problems and development needs. CiteSpace is a knowledge visualization analysis tool, which has unique advantages in drawing knowledge graphs such as keywords, authors, and institutions. Based on the CiteSpace software, this paper analyzes the literature in the field of ethical research on biobanks in China in the past 15 years, and conducts a visual analysis of related contents such as hotspots, authors, and research institutions, so as to provide certain references for subsequent researchers. Using CiteSpace 6.3.R1 software, literature in the field of ethical research on biobank included in the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) database between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2023 was visualized and analyzed. A total of 68 literatures were included in this analysis. The annual published literature volume of ethical research on biobank in the past 15 years has generally shown a fluctuating upward trend; there are some research teams working closely together in this field, but the cooperation among institutional organizations is mainly internal, so the research cooperation among different authors and institutions still needs to be strengthened; the hotspots of research in this field include ethical management, norms, informed consent, and privacy protection, etc. Currently, the field still needs to be developed in China, and the ethical regulations and norms, informed consent, and privacy protection related to biobank need to be further explored and researched.",

    "abstract": "In recent decades, there has been a growing global interest in more holistic and integrative approaches to healthcare, fostering debates about the legitimacy, accessibility, and integration of Integrative and Complementary Health Practices (ICHP) into national health systems. In Brazil, these practices were officially incorporated into the Unified Health System (SUS) in 2006. Despite significant progress in public policy, the educational dimension remains one of the greatest challenges for the effective implementation of these practices. This study describes the creation, development, and evaluation of a postgraduate specialization course in ICHP, offered by a Brazilian public university. The course aimed to fill a training gap by presenting the 29 practices currently offered by SUS, promoting a broader understanding of the health-disease-care process. The initiative sought not only to inform and train professionals but also to foster a \"culture of care,\" based on humanization, shared responsibility, and empowerment. Two editions of the course were held between 2021 and 2024. The first was delivered entirely online due to the COVID-19 pandemic, while the second adopted a hybrid format. Both editions prioritized an organic methodology, reflective practices, and a close relationship between students and faculty. Professors were nominated by their respective national associations, strengthening both the legitimacy of the course and the connection between academia and the community. To assess the course's impact, students responded to open-ended questionnaires at the beginning and end of the course. The instruments collected demographic data, professional background, motivations, expectations, and perceptions regarding the course's relevance and structure. Preliminary analysis reveals significant transformations in the students' personal and professional trajectories, indicating the course's efetividade in building a new perspective on care and self-care, based on multidimensionality and completeness. The results reinforce the need for the more systematic integration of ICHP education into higher education curricula, especially in health-related fields. In both cohorts (approximately 78% of participants), students reported feeling deeply transformed and better prepared to incorporate new integrative practices into their work, indicating that the course has fulfilled its role in promoting meaningful change. It is concluded that qualified education in ICHP, when guided by an integrative, critical, and humanizing approach, has the potential not only to strengthen human resources for the SUS but also to expand the epistemological field of healthcare. This could contribute not only to broadening therapeutic options within SUS but also to building more humane, culturally sensitive, and financially sustainable health systems. The Brazilian experience, as detailed in this study, may serve as a model for other countries seeking to integrate traditional, complementary, and integrative medicine into formal education and health services.",

    "abstract": "Oxidative stress is one of the consequences of abnormal mitochondrial function. It is also mainly responsible for systemic consequences like inflammatory, cardiovascular, and metabolic diseases. Restoration of the mitochondrial activity might then constitute a potential therapeutic target to be accomplished. In that sense, two homeopathic complexes Ubichinon compositum® (Ubi) and Coenzyme compositum® (Comp) (Heel, Baden-Baden, Germany), have been used in clinical practice as complementary terapia for all those problems potentially related to oxidative stress. The objective of this study was to establish an in vitro model to evaluate the protective activity of these compounds. To understand the effects of both mixes, human fibroblasts isolated from the foreskin were exposed to different concentrations of the compounds to detect changes in the metabolic processes related to viability by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H- tetrazolium bromide (MTT). Later, the mixes were tested to observe any pro-survival, anti-stress effects of the fibroblasts that were exposed and stressed to H2O2 (ROS cell stressor). To assess the effects on cell metabolism and viability, three tests were performed, considering two times, 24h and 48h, and concentrations including control medium, medium + PBS (nutrient reduction), x/8, x/4, X/2 and X (100%, the concentration recommended by the manufacturer) in a 96-well plate. We choose to use the X/2 concentration. We seek to know if the exposure during different time points (tx) to the compounds may cause a preventive effect for the cells against the cell stressor. Next, we aimed to test whether the administration of the compounds at zero time, plus the administration of the cellular stressor H2O2 helps fibroblasts to survive (Protection Assay). Both compounds were tested alone or in combination. After obtaining these results, we include a positive protection control that is physiologically known. We used 15mM glutathione, that is, 15mg in 54.2mL of solvent, and tested it by Flow Cytometry using a fluorescent marker of ROS production. The results from incubating fibroblasts with hydrogen peroxide, as well as with the simultaneous addition of Coenzyme compositum (Comp), Ubichinon compositum (Ubi) showed that hydrogen peroxide (HO) reduces fibroblast viability, while the addition of either Coenzyme compositum or Ubichinon compositum restores their viabilityan effect also observed when both products are used in combination. After obtaining these results, a second model was developed to evaluate the ability of these products, alone or in combination, to preserve the viability of fibroblasts exposed to oxidative stress induced by hydrogen peroxide, the addition of HO reduces fibroblast viability to 37.7%. However, when the fibroblasts exposed to hydrogen peroxide were incubated simultaneously with Coenzyme compositum (CO), their viability was restored to 78.6%. In contrast, when incubated with Ubichinon compositum (UBI), the viability of the fibroblasts exposed to HO was restored to 67.9%. In conclusion, the compounds showed a protective effect after ROS damage, which can be synergistic if used together. Further assays will help to better understand this effect and observe an improvement in cellular function.",

Objective: To describe data from a national survey on the profile and training of nurses in TCIM in Brazil. This is a quantitative, cross-sectional, online study which used a questionnaire containing open and closed questions for 1,154 nurses in Brazil. Stata IC software, version 16.0, was used for the statistical analysis. Descriptive and inferential statistical tests were tested. The project was approved by the Ethics Committee under CAAE No. 43306921.6.0000.5347. This study included 1,154 nurses, 99.65% Brazilian, women (90%), with an average age of 39, self-declared white (72.65%), born in the South (45.06%), married (41.28%), with children (56.93%), with an income of up to four minimum wages (52.43%) and with active professional registration (97.31%-1,120/1,154). The prevalence of training in TCIM was 43.50% (502/1,154), carried out on average for the first time in 2014 (SD=7.38 years) and the recurring practices were Auriculoterapia (59.96%), Imposition of Hands (37.45%), Aromaterapia (29.28%) and Acupuncture (27.49%). The first contact with MCTI was as patients (15%-173/1,154), through professional colleagues (11.79%-136/1,154), or through people in the health sector (9.36%-108/1,154). The investment in TCIM training courses was up to R$1,000.00 per year for 61.77% of the participants and 85.97% believed in the rise of this job market. The prevalence of working in TCIM was 64.6% (323/500) and the workload was up to two hours a week (36.96%). The most common place of work was atenção primária (UBS, ESF) for 33.40% (167/500), followed by clinics or private practices (24.0%-120/500). These consultations were characterized as individual (78%-390/500), followed by group educational activities (31.0%-155/500), group sessions (17.60%-88/50) and telecare (11.40%-55/500). The study also showed that nine out of 10 participants (93.01%) consider TCIM to be important or very important for their professional work. They stated that having knowledge of, contact with or use of TCIM influences the autonomy of nurses (88.20%) and patients (96.8%). When asked about conducting research into baseado em evidence conduct to support a technique or practice, 50.0% (250/500) reported searching in the Virtual Health Library of Traditional Complementary and Integrative Medicines; 43.0% (215/500) in books; 34.60% (173/500) in specialized journals; 28.20% (141/500) in Google and 14.0% (70/500) in the evidence maps produced by the Brazilian Academic Consortium of Integrative Health. 56.87% (285/501) of the participants reported lacking some knowledge in areas such as management, social or private entrepreneurship or administration in order to incorporate TCIM into their work routine. The growth of TCIM in nursing is undeniable, with a predominance in PHC, but there are training gaps in management. Valuing TCIM and its transformative potential reinforces the need for public investment in training and structuring services.",

    "abstract": "This is a randomized, triple-blind, placebo-controlled ensaio clínico conducted to investigate the impact of aromaterapia on the sleep quality of elderly people. The population involved in the study was recruited voluntarily using a self-selection technique through an invitation by email, dissemination in the press and other social media, or by those seeking care from the integrative practices offered at the teaching and extension house of the School of Nursing (House 5) of the University of São Paulo, Ribeirão Preto Campus. Regarding ethical aspects, resolution 14.874 of May 28, 2024 of the Brazilian National Health Council was respected, the project was approved by the ethics committee of the University of São Paulo under CAE: 75336523.0.0000.5393. Data regarding sociodemographic and clinical characteristics were collected through an electronic form developed by the researcher. Sleep quality was assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index instrument, published by Buysse in 1989, translated and validated into Portuguese, and consists of a questionnaire that assesses sleep quality over a one-month period. It contains 24 questions with scores ranging from 0 to 3, with 5 questions used only for clinical information and 19 categorized into seven components: subjective sleep quality; sleep latency; sleep duration; habitual sleep efficiency; sleep disorders; use of sleeping medication; and daytime dysfunction. The sum of the scores of the seven components produces an overall score from 0 to 21, where the highest score indicates the worst sleep quality. An overall score greater than 5 indicates poor sleep quality. From September 2024 to May 2025, 303 people completed the form with the questionnaires and the informed consent form to participate in the research. Of these, 39 people did not answer the questionnaire completely, making it impossible to continue the research, and 59 people did not meet the age criterion (over 60 years old). A total of 206 people met the eligibility criteria. Regarding the sociodemographic characteristics of the respondents, 85.1% were women, 47.6% were married, 79.1% declared themselves to be white, and 65% had higher education. Regarding the clinical characteristics of sleep: 18.9% reported undergoing some tratamento for insomnia, and 91.3% suffer from some sleep-wake disorder. Regarding the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, the average overall score of the respondents was 10.88, with a standard deviation of 4.07, which indicates the presence of sleep disorders. The components with the highest average scores were: component 1 (subjective sleep quality); 2 (sleep latency) and 5 (presence of sleep disorders) respectively. The data presented reveal that among the physiological changes of aging is the change in sleep patterns, which become more superficial and fragmented in the elderly, resulting in reduced and less effective sleep quality, making research into intervençãos to manage these changes necessary. Aromaterapia can be a low-cost, non-invasive, safe and effective tratamento for this population.",

    "abstract": "ntegrative medicine in its various forms has developed from a purely alternative to a vital part of a comprehensive medicine, in which the respective offerings such as Mindfulness, Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), Herbal Medicine or Homeopathy can be understood as vital parts of an Integrative Medicine. Nevertheless, costs, together with the efetividade of such intervençãos are still considered as an important argument for political decision-makers when it comes to reimbursability by health insurances or integration of such approaches in tratamento guidelines. This presentation based on current health-economic research aims at shedding light on this aspect and attempts to use recent findings to highlight implications for further research. After an introduction to the terminology of health economics, an overview of the relevant research in integrative medicine is given using a systematic search for reviews on helath economics in the field of integrative medicine. Using the results of these revisão sistemáticas on health economic studies in integrative medicine relevant data such as origin, health economic approach and patient population are extracted and presented. Based on an examination of the quality of included studies using measures like the Consensus on Health Economic Criteria (CHEC) List, pitfalls as well as methodological strengths and weaknesses are also identified. In addition to early reviews that dealt with health economic studies and their quality in general, comparative analyses can also be carried out for specific areas. In all reviews screened, a more or less pronounced positive trend in study quality is visible. However, despite an increased awareness for conducting high quality ensaio clínicos in Integrative Medicine, health economic evaluations still tend to be fragile in terms of guideline adherence and methodological rigor. This harbors the danger of the entire and entirely justified approach being discredited. Based on the positive examples of health economic evaluations, suggestions for a comprehensive methodological framework as to how and why various health economic approaches may be applied to Integrative Medicine in a sound and accurate way are presented. Researchers planning a cost evaluation should be encouraged but also feel reminded that economic evaluation methodology increasingly calls for proper qualidade de vida estimates and preferably the use of incremental cost efetividade and/or net health benefit estimates. If there is an attitude to increase the quality of health economic evaluations, Integrative Medicine would generate good arguments for stakeholders and decision makers in the healthcare system.",

    "abstract": "Neurodivergent children require specific care that can be emotionally and physically burdensome for their caregivers and family members. Therefore, maintaining their qualidade de vida is of paramount importance. Family members and caregivers of neurodiverse children face ongoing challenges that can lead to stress, ansiedade, and depressão. Complementary and Integrative Health Practices (CIPs) are known for their positive effects, promoting a state of calm and balance, which can be used as significant support for mental and emotional health. Considering the care provided to these caregivers, a 12-week group program was developed, including CIPs and psychoeducation on self-care, with the aim of analyzing the impact of CIPs on the qualidade de vida, stress, and ansiedade of caregivers and family members of neurodiverse children. This study was conducted through a longitudinal randomized ensaio clínico, lasting 12 (twelve) weeks. A total of 12 (twelve) caregivers and family members of neurodiverse children who receive care at the Núcleo pela Criança (NUPI) in a city in the state of Paraná, located in southern Brazil, participated. All participants authorized the research through the Free and Consentimento Informado Form. The participants were divided into two groups: the Intervention Group (IG) and the Control Group (CG). The IG participated in weekly meetings that included complementary practices, such as auriculoterapia, aromaterapia, Tai Chi Chuan, Yoga and relaxation techniques. Each weekly session, lasting approximately 120 minutes, consisted of a theoretical lecture and practical activities related to the topic addressed, led by an interdisciplinary team. The CG was composed of family members who accompanied the children during tratamento at the same institution, but did not participate in the therapeutic intervençãos offered to the IG. The efetividade of the intervençãos was assessed using validated questionnaires, including the WHOQOL-Bref, Stress Perception Scale (EPS-10) and the Anxiety Inventory (BAI). The questionnaires were administered at the beginning and at the end of the program, after the 12 weeks of intervenção. The results showed that CIPs promoted statistically significant improvements in stress and ansiedade levels and in the perception of qualidade de vida among IG participants. A progressive reduction in stress and ansiedade scores was observed over the 12 weeks, accompanied by an increase in indicators of subjective well-being and satisfaction with life, as measured by the validated instruments used. In contrast, CG participants showed stability in the scores of the same variables, with no statistically relevant changes throughout the period analyzed. This evidence reinforces the potential of CIPs as adjuvant therapeutic strategies in the care of family members and caregivers of neurodiverse children, contributing significantly to the promotion of emotional well-being. The data suggest that the systematic insertion of these practices can favor emotional regulation, the attenuation of symptoms related to stress and ansiedade, in addition to positively impacting the subjective perception of qualidade de vida. These results support the use of CIPs in contexts of psychosocial care and comprehensive healthcare, highlighting their potential as a complementary resource in practices of promotion and recovery of biopsychosocial well-being.",

    "abstract": "Western medicine has been organised under the biomedical or conventional model since its inception. While this approach provides solutions for various illnesses, it has faced considerable dissatisfaction, leading to an increasing number of individuals seeking alternative forms of care. In this context, integrative medicine (IM) represents the integration of traditional and complementary medicine, employing all health disciplines to achieve the best resultados for patients, including practices such as yoga, herbal terapia, acupuntura, and meditação, among others. IM can be a valuable ally in oncological tratamento, particularly for palliative care in breast cancer. This revisão sistemáticas aims to identify the benefits of integrative medicine in the life quality of women with breast cancer. Recovery and critical analysis of literature from articles found in the CAPES and BVSALUD databases, using the descriptors \"integrative medicine,\" \"complementary medicine,\" and \"breast cancer.\" There were no restrictions on publication date. As a filter, only open-access articles were included. All articles were read and evaluated individually. All information was organised into four categories proposed by the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (USA): bodywork, mind-body, and biological intervençãos. Additionally, a column titled \"nutrition\" was included. All selected studies reported benefits of IM when used alongside conventional breast cancer tratamento.  Bodywork practices such as physical activity reduced fatigue, lymphedema, depressão, and neuropathy. Massage terapia alleviated stress and ansiedade while increasing NK cells and lymphocytes.  Mind-body practices including yoga, Tai Chi, meditação, guided breathing, pranic healing, and music terapia significantly improved psychological and physical symptoms such as ansiedade, pain, and sleep disturbances.  Biological practices, particularly acupuntura, were effective in managing pain, hot flashes, fatigue, and insomnia.  Nutrition: Diets rich in vegetables, fruits, grains, and low in red meat, sugar, and alcohol were associated with better resultados. However, natural diets and the use of supplements such as vitamin C, green tea, and turmeric showed limited scientific evidence. In addition to conventional and pharmacological tratamentos, integrative medicine can be a significant ally in reducing pain, decreasing the incidence of psychological resultados, and enhancing immune response. IM as palliative care improves qualidade de vida of women battling breast cancer.",

    "abstract": "This research aims to analyse the impact of different tactics in the facilitation of Farol Saúde Integrativa activities - a social business pilot which promotes Integrative health in vulnerable districts - in cooperation with the Brazilian Unified Health Care System in its implementation in the district of Capão Redondo in the outskirts of São Paulo - Brasil. First, we will analyse the specifications of the territory and the design of Farol as a social business and its first strategies to enter the territory, including their theoretical references. We will then conduct a quantitative analysis of the impact of different territorial facilitation tactics on the activities carried out in this cooperation. Understanding the importance of combining data and experience in collective health, we will also rely on the performance autoethnography of both the manager of this social business and its territorial facilitator, as well as semi-structured interviews with professionals of the saúde pública services. We observed that the territorial facilitation led Farol from 5 monthly group activities in collaboration with saúde pública services in August 2024 - when collaborations started - to 15 in March 2025. The number of monthly participants in said activities rose from 72 to 199 during the same time. In this period Farol collaborated with 8 different saúde pública services. Analysing the experience of the territorial facilitation we noticed that first of all, it is important to have a social facilitator who is deeply related with the territory they are facilitating. Secondly, we also noticed that the managers of the saúde pública services are overwhelmed with tasks, and if the dialogue is centered on them, organizing joint actions becomes very difficult and bureaucratic. Spreading the conversation among different professionals, always with the awareness of the managers seems to be a better strategy. Thirdly, we understood that health professionals tend to engage better in actions that are built in cooperation, rather than preset activities brought by the social business. Furthermore, the facilitation seems to flow better with health professionals when done face-to-face rather than in more formal channels, like email exchanges. Finally, in a very dynamic environment such as a atenção primária service like Primary Care Unities, it is important to be present, visiting the services frequently and talking to the professionals, users and the members responsible for the social control. Our preliminary results show that it was necessary to combine different approaches when it comes to territorial facilitation of a social business in a new territory, especially when it requires engaging the public services in a vulnerable area.",

    "abstract": "Obesity increasing the risk of developing associated conditions such as dyslipidemia, hyperinsulinemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, certain types of cancer, and cardiovascular diseases. Anti-obesity drugs can cause significant side effects. Thus, the combination of Angelica keiskei+Panax ginseng extractshas gained attention, considering its effects. Panax ginseng extract is well known for its anti-obesity, anti-hyperglycemic, and cardiovascular benefits. Similarly, Angelica keiskei extract has been shown to reduce adiposity and lower serum cholesterol, glucose, and insulin levels in diet-induced obese animals. Therefore, it is reasonable to hypothesize that combining Panax ginseng and Angelica keiskei extracts could yield even more favorable resultados. Preclinical studies have shown that the active compounds in Angelica keiskei+Panax ginseng enhance mitochondrial biogenesis, leading to increased antioxidant production, improved glucose utilization, higher fatty acid oxidation, and browning of adipose tissue. Objective: This study aimed to determine whether the administration of a combination of Angelica keiskei+Panax ginseng in obese Wistar rats induces hemodynamic changes, and to assess the metabolic alterations. Fourteen male Wistar rats were used in this study (approved by the ethics committee, CEUA n. 4320090622). At 50 days of age, all animals underwent a 12-week obesity induction protocol via a high-fat diet. Following this period, the animals were divided into two groups: the Obese Control Group (OB; n=7) and the Angelica Keiskei+Panax Ginseng Group (AK+PG; n=7). The AK+PG received six weeks of oral administration of a standardized extract containing both herbal components (Mitocondrin®) at dose 100 mg/kg, administered twice per week. The OB group received only an oral administration of the vehicle solution. Body composition was assessed by DXA (Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry), systolic blood pressure was measured using tail plethysmography and fasting blood glucose was recorded. After euthanasia, obesogenic parameters (body mass, relative tissue weight, and adiposity index), serum levels of inflammatory markers (IL-6, TNF-, and IL-10), and serum NO levels were analyzed. After six weeks of tratamento, changes in body mass (g) indicated that the AK+PG (6.44±1.08g,n=7) had significantly lower values compared to the OB (14.33 ±2.05g,n=7;p=0.02). Fat mass (g) was also reduced in the AK+PG (72.38±6.90g,n=7) compared to the OB (106.90±12.03g,n=7;p=0.044). For other obesogenic variablesincluding the relative weight of fat deposits (RET, MES, and EPI), adiposity index, fat percentage, and lean mass/fat mass ratioa slight reduction in mean values was observed. Regarding fasting blood glucose levels, the AK+PG (-7.71±2.10mg/dl,n=7) exhibited significantly lower mean values compared to the OB (7.00±4.23mg/dl,n=7;p=0.009). Similarly, systolic blood pressure was significantly reduced in the tratamento AK+PG (-28.51± 4.00mmHg, n=7) compared to the control (7.65 ± 6.64mmHg, n=7; p = 0.0005). Serum NO levels did not show significant differences, nor did serum levels of IL-6 and IL-10. However, the AK+PG exhibited significantly reduced TNF- levels (482.83±129.40pg/ml, n=7) compared to the OB (1248.00±299.44pg/ml,n=7; p=0.033). In obese Wistar rats, sex weeks oral tratamento with standardized extracts of Angelica keiskei+Panax ginseng was able to reduces fat mass, reduce blood glucose levels, reduces systolic blood pressure and reduces TNF- levels.",

    "abstract": "The World Health Organization currently monitors just three types of governance mechanisms for traditional, complementary, and integrative medicine (TCIM): National Policies, National Legislation, National Regulation on Herbal Medicines. However, TCIM governance is complex, spanning multiple sectors and including many elements. To support technical cooperation and good TCIM governance worldwide, comprehensive analytic tools are needed. Using a data-driven approach based on the Framework method (Richie & Spencer), the authors constructed an analytic framework for characterizing the wide range of TCIM governance approaches across the Americas region. The framework was informed by policy analytic parameters for TCIM practitioners and practices proposed with respect to the civil law contexts of Latin America, and by analyses of TCIMs common law, civil society and private sector governance in Canada and the United States. The framework classifies TCIM governance approaches according to their: a) domain (e.g., customary law, state governance and level within legal hierarchies, civil society, public sector); b) TCIM-related specificity (if a governance approach addresses TCIM only, or also other matters); c) TCIM type (e.g., Indigenous traditional medicine, ethnomedicine, complementary, etc.); d) health systems elements (e.g., service delivery, financing, workforce); e) intersectoral dimensions (e.g., biodiversity); and, f) TCIM aspect addressed (e.g., practitioners, products, reimbursement). This work advances a classification model addressing TCIM governances unique features. The framework offers scholars, policy-makers and managers a tool for harmonizing analyses of TCIM governance across contexts. It may inform horizontal cooperation between jurisdictions and provide a meaningful basis for structuring a WHO-planned global TCIM governance repository.",

    "abstract": "Traditional Chinese medicine formula granules are a new type of traditional Chinese medicine dosage form. They are made from traditional Chinese medicinal materials through modern pharmaceutical processes such as extraction, concentration, drying and granulation. They have the advantages of being convenient to take, store and transport, and having stable quality. They are widely used in clinical practice and have a good market prospect. The study is designed to delve into frontline traditional Chinese medicine physicians' cognition and clinical application status of traditional Chinese medicine formula granules through qualitativo interviews, so as to fill the research gap from clinical practice perspectives, thereby providing a basis for the application of formula granules. We conducted semi-structured, ~30-minute phone interviews with 10 traditional Chinese medicine physicians using purposive sampling. Selection criteria included: (1) Full-time TCM practitioners in public hospitals or community clinics; (2) Minimum 3 years of clinical practice experience; (3) Experience using TCM formula granules in clinical practice; (4) Voluntary participation. The interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and subsequently coded and thematically analyzed using NVivo. During analysis, themes emerged across three domains. First, in terms of cognition, all interviewed physicians demonstrated a certain level of understanding of traditional Chinese medicine formula granules, and 70% of them primarily acquired initial knowledge through hospital introductions. Second, regarding clinical application, the frequency of doctors' application was mostly less than 50%, with convenience being the primary consideration. They acknowledged the convenience, stable quality and storage advantages of formula granules compared to traditional decoction pieces. However, they also mentioned challenges such as higher costs and the absence of clear standards for dosage conversion between formula granules and decoction pieces. In terms of efficacy, 30% of physicians considered formula granules to be comparable to decoction pieces, with mixed usage in a minorities of cases. Some pointed out the superiority of formula granules in specific clinical scenarios, such as acute conditions. Physicians believed that formula granules would impact decoctions pieces (60%), but both would develop in parallel. Third, concerning future prospects, physicians generally expressed a desire for reduced costs (80%), standardized dosage conversion (50%) and enhanced scientific research (40%). This study conducted in-depth qualitativo interviews with frontline traditional Chinese medicine physicians to investigate their cognition, clinical application, and future prospects regarding traditional Chinese medicine formula granules. By exploring the developmental prospects of formula granules, the research provides crucial evidence for advancing clinical utilization of formula granules. Furthermore, it proposes actionable recommendations to optimize their implementation in clinical settings.",

    "abstract": "In our fast-paced society, very few people take the time to listen to others. The unfulfilled essential need of being heard has far-reaching consequences, such as loneliness and the associated mental and physical illnesses. We are interested in whether open-minded and value-free listening, offered in a secure space called the Zuhörraum, can influence the feelings of happiness, affect, and connectedness of the visitors (tellers) and listeners, in the moment. Furthermore, we will explore whether the feeling of connectedness will emerge and may partly drive the beneficial effects. A mixed-methods design is used, meaning 1) quantitative questionnaires to evaluate happiness (single item), affect (affect grid), and social connectedness (inclusion of the other in the self scale, IOS) by tellers and listeners (n185 in August 2025), as well as socioeconomic factors and other covariates. In addition, a survey pre- and post-implementation of the Zuhörraum intends to assess changes in terms of the above-mentioned determinants in persons living in the area surrounding the Zuhörraum. 2) A total of 1215 microphenomenological interviews à 60  90 min. are conducted with tellers, recorded, transcribed and completed including observed gestures. By applying this method, we will assess the perceived feeling of connectedness as experienced during the so-called listening hour (approximately 45 min in the room). For this purpose the microphenomenologically-trained interviewer, evokes the lived experience through memories of emotional moments, and perceptions in order to receive a precise description on the feeling of connectedness. The ethics vote was obtained from the ethics committee of the University Witten/Herdecke (no. 329/2024). Preliminary results from the Zuhörraum suggest increases in happiness and connectedness in tellers (N=9) and listeners (N=10), visiting the room. The average difference considering both tellers and listeners before and after the Zuhörraum showed an increase of 0.7 ± 1.0 points for happiness and 1.5 ± 1.3 points for connectedness. Both measures were slightly higher in tellers as compared to listeners. The affect scale is more complex and remains for analysis after completion of the field phase (August 2025). Regarding the mixed  method approach we will apply qualitativo interviews to explore the subjective feeling of connectedness. We expect a total data set of around N = 180 persons who provide quantitative data from the listening room and N = 15 participants providing microphenomenological data by August 2025. The results of this study will show the health-related effects of the integration of a listening room Zuhörraum at an individual level. The findings may help to develop health-promoting measures to improve connectedness and its functions, and thus counteract the increasing isolation and loneliness in society with all its related negative side effects for health.",

    "abstract": "Cats Claw (Uncaria tomentosa) is an Amazonian traditional herb used by Indigenous in shamanic phytoterapia. Recognized for its medicinal properties, it has attracted global scientific interest aimed at validating its botanical relevance and the traditional knowledge surrounding its Integrative complementary medicine to healthcare. This study aimed to analyze, in a quantitative, qualitativo, and descriptive way, the global scientific and technological production related to Uncaria tomentosa. Using bibliometric analysis supported by artificial intelligence, data were collected from two major databases: Scopus (for scientific literature) and Lens.org (for patents). The search term Uncaria tomentosa returned 610 scientific articles published between 1985 and 2025, and 1,332 patents registered from 1982 to 2025. The results highlight the United States as an expressive contribution in both scientific and technological domains, with 725 patent filings. Other prominent countries involved in recent research include Brazil, China (130 patents), India, Poland, and Spain. Notably, Brazil leads in acadêmico output, with 785 published articles, and maintains active collaboration with Peru, particularly in the Southwestern Amazon. Interest in the species has significantly grown since 2005, especially in the U.S. The pharmacological potential of Uncaria tomentosa herbal is of considerable importance to global saúde pública. Studies and patents have associated it with tratamentos for cancer, Alzheimers disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and inflammatory conditionsall high-impact, high-cost illnesses, particularly for saúde pública systems like Brazils SUS. Roughly 55% of the studies analyzed medicinal potential. From a technological standpoint, patent classifications follow the International Patent Classification (IPC) codes, primarily in categories linked to human health and nutrition: A61K (medical preparations), A23L (food), A61P (therapeutic compounds), A23V (nutrition), and A61Q (cosmetics). The top patent-holding companies include Metaproteomics LLC, Optigenex Inc., Cognitive Clarity, Lipotec S.A., and Valensa International. The Journal of Ethnopharmacology is the most prominent journal for acadêmico publications on the species, with 36 articles. In Brazil, the access and use of genetic resources and traditional knowledge are regulated under Law No. 13,123/2015. The species is found across the Amazon, its ethnobotanical origin is more frequently linked to Peru, where structured and legalized production already exists. Uncaria tomentosa is a liana that relies on tall, mature trees to reach sunlight, making it highly dependent on intact forest ecosystems. Unsustainable harvesting and lack of proper management plans pose serious risks to its survival, potentially leading to a tragedy of the commons scenario. Given its ecological, pharmacological, and economic relevance, increased investment is needed in collaborative research between scientific institutions, traditional communities and companies. Public fundingespecially from international agencies and Brazilian institutions such as the State Research Support Foundations (FAPs)should prioritize studies focused on the plants ecological, ethnopharmacological, phenological, phytochemical, clinical, and genetic dimensions, promoting both conservation and sustainable innovation.",

    "abstract": "Postoperative pain and ansiedade are prevalent challenges that impair recovery. Biofield Therapies (BTs) such as Therapeutic Touch and Reiki are non-invasive complementary intervençãos proposed for the management of these symptoms. This revisão sistemática and metanálise synthesizes the most current evidence on their efetividade for these resultados in postoperative care. A systematic search was performed in PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane databases in August 2025. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing BT to standard care or sham control in postoperative adults were included. Primary resultados were pain intensity and ansiedade intensity. The risk of bias assessment (using the Cochrane RoB 2 tool) were performed independently by two reviewers. According to the PRISMA flowchart, eight RCTs were included. One study contributed data for both resultados, resulting in six studies for the pain metanálise (n=477) and three studies for the ansiedade metanálise (n=296). Pooled estimates were calculated as Standardized Mean Differences (SMD) using random-effects models. The meta-analyses revealed a strong contrast between resultados. For postoperative ansiedade, the pooled estimate showed a large, clinically relevant reduction favoring BTs, although it did not reach conventional statistical significance (SMD = -1.18, 95% CI: -3.78 to 1.41; p = 0.189). Crucially, the analysis revealed no heterogeneity (I2 = 0%, p = 0.633), indicating a consistent direction of effects across studies. For postoperative pain, the pooled effect was trivial and nonsignificant (SMD = 0.09, 95% CI: -0.84 to 1.03; p = 0.845). This result was characterized by extreme and statistically significant heterogeneity (I2 = 99.6%, Q = 2396.02, p < 0.001; 2 = 3.96). The efficacy of BT is highly resultado-specific. Although a precise and significant overall effect on pain was not found due to extreme and unexplained heterogeneity across studies, the therapies show a consistent and promising signal for reducing postoperative ansiedade. The findings for pain suggest that the effect is highly context-dependent, necessitating research on specific effect modifiers rather than the overall average effect. For ansiedade, future research should prioritize larger ensaio clínicos with sufficient statistical power to confirm the potential benefit suggested by current consistent evidence. BT should not be dismissed as ineffective; instead, the focus should shift to identifying for whom and under what conditions it is most effective.",

Despite increasing policy-level support, structured, evidence-informed promoção da saúde guidelines specifically tailored to TTM remain limited. This study aimed to develop a culturally grounded promoção da saúde guideline based on the five strategic action areas of the Ottawa Charter, by identifying and validating key componentsnamely, criteria, indicators, and verifiersrelevant to a TTM-based framework aligned with the Ottawa Charter principles. A mixed-methods study was adopted. Fifteen experts were selected through purposive and snowball sampling, including ten TTM specialists and five specialists in related fields. Quantitative data from structured questionnaires were analysed using descriptive statistics, the Content Validity Index (CVI), and the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). Qualitative data from semi-structured interviews were examined through framework analysis mapped to the five domains of the Ottawa Charter. The study produced a validated guideline framework comprising five domains, seven criteria, 21 indicators, and 61 verifiers. Building Healthy Public Policy emerged as the most critical domain, underscoring the need for coherent and culturally responsive policy. Other domainssuch as community action, personal skills, and reoriented serviceshighlighted engagement, literacy, and system integration. Barriers included fragmented policies and undefined TTM roles; facilitators included cultural resonance and practitioner readiness. Expert consultation supported the development of a context-specific, evidence-informed promoção da saúde guideline integrating TTM into Thailands health system. The resulting framework lays a strong foundation for improving culturally relevant atenção primária and community health strategies.",

In addition, up to 80% of patients express their desire regarding complementary and integrative tratamento. The CCC-Integrativ study developed, implemented and evaluated a patient-centered, interprofessional and baseado em evidence complementary and integrative health (CIH) counseling program for oncology patients at four Comprehensive Cancer Centers (CCC) in Baden-Wuerttemberg, Germany. The present study evaluates the impact of this counseling on self-efficacy, depressão and fatigue. We conducted a multicenter controlled naturalistic implementation study. Cancer patients received three tailored CIH counseling sessions within 3 months, of which at least the first counseling was conducted by an interprofessional team of physicians and nurses. Patients completed validated questionnaires before the first session (T1) and immediately after the 3-month intervenção period (T2). Outcomes included self-efficacy (SES6G), depressão (PHQ-9) and fatigue (EORTC-QLQ-FA12). Data were analyzed using linear mixed models (LMM). The study included n=1128 oncology patients (control group n=443, intervenção group n=685) with various tumor types and stages within an outpatient setting. Two thirds (75.7%) were female. The results for self-efficacy in SES-6G showed a statistically significant time x group interaction effect (F(2,1848)=3.084; p=0.046) from T1 to T2 with a difference in difference (DiD) of 0.25 points and a weak effect size of d=0.125. For depressão (PHQ-9), the model also revealed a statistically significant time x group interaction effect (F(2,1859)=6.194; p=0.002). The estimated DiD between control and intervenção group regarding the change from T1 to T2 was -0.82 [95% CI: -1.35; -0.29] points in favor of the IG with a weak effect size of d=0.185. The EORTC-QLQ-FA12 showed a statistically significant interaction between time and the study groups (F(2, 1859)=6.194, p<0.002). The estimated DiD regarding the change between T1 and T2 was -3.57 [95% CI: -6.13; -1.01] points in favor of the IG with an effect size of d=0.169. Our study demonstrates that tailored, baseado em evidence interprofessional CIH counseling can significantly improve self-efficacy, reduce depressive symptoms, and alleviate fatigue in cancer patients. This integrative approach shows promise in managing distressing cancer-related symptoms while concurrently meeting the high patient demand for CIH tratamento. These results support the incorporation of structured interprofessional CIH counseling into comprehensive cancer care models.",

    "abstract": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune, inflammatory, and neurodegenerative disease. It is the most common neurological condition among young adults. MS is characterized by inflammatory processes in the brain and spinal cord, as well as the degeneration of myelin  the protective sheath that insulates nerve fibers and facilitates the transmission of electrical impulses. Currently, there is no cure for MS. This incurability underlines the importance of symptom management and efforts to prevent disease progression. This circumstance increases stress levels for MS patients  often referred to as the burden of disease  which may, in turn, trigger relapses. Patients often report that stressful life events exacerbate their symptoms. Science-based lifestyle change intervençãos, such as MBSR programs, are promising approaches. Studies show that MBSR and relaxation training are effective in reducing ansiedade, depressão, and stress in patients with MS. Regular physical exercise has beneficial effects even in individuals with pre-existing disabilities and can positively impact low-grade inflammation. Moreover, diet and nutrition can be health-promoting factors. Social, emotional, and cognitive factors, including gratitude, acceptance, and self-compassion, have received little attention in the scientific debate on MS tratamento. Consequently, there is a significant research gap in integrative medicine in MS tratamento and care. The aim of this study is to identify the resources and self-help strategies currently used by individuals with MS and to explore their needs and perspectives regarding integrative medicine. We conducted a focus group in March 2025 with six individuals with MS and one neurologist as well as an additional interview with a content expert in July 2025 to identify areas where support is needed but not currently addressed by conventional medicine. The focus group and the interview were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using Phenomenological Inquiry and the software MAXQDA. Patients experience a reduced qualidade de vida due to a wide range of symptoms, including fatigue, spasticity, disability, ansiedade, and cognitive impairment. These symptoms can lead to social isolation, loneliness, absenteeism from work, early retirement, and increased stress levels. The latter not only affects overall well-being but is also influenced by  and can influence  the course of the disease. Four key areas emerged, highlighting the need for self-help strategies, as well as knowledge, training, and specialized courses. The four areas are behavior, exercise, relaxation, and nutrition. Behavior includes, for example, self-help strategies, gratitude, setting boundaries, standing up for oneself, spending time in nature, communication, stress management and maintaining a social network. Exercise encompasses sports, strength training, and walking. Relaxation includes meditação, atenção plena practices, and moving meditaçãos such as Qigong or yoga. Nutrition involves an anti-inflammatory diet, a vegan diet, and knowledge about a healthy gut microbiome. The focus group and content expert interview revealed the unmet needs of individuals living with MS in areas not currently addressed by conventional medicine. These findings highlight the need to incorporate integrative medicine in the tratamento of multiple sclerosis.",

    "abstract": "Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) is based on Taoism, according to which all matter and energy originate from the Primordial Void (Wu Ji), manifesting itself in a bipolar form (Yin/Yang) and generating a cyclical flow of five manifestations (Wu Xing) animated and integrated by Qi, a dynamic life force that flows through energy channels integrating life with the universe. Recent advances in quantum biology and integrative biophysics, under the umbrella of energy medicine, have introduced scientific models and evidence that can help reinterpret TCM from a contemporary scientific perspective. This study aims to integrate three energy domains: the geomagnetic field (GMFD), the quantum field (QFD), and the human biofield (HBFD) as epistemological foundations that support an energy continuum and promote dialogue between modern science and ancestral traditions. A narrative review was conducted based on scientific literature published between 2005 and 2025, retrieved from indexed databases (PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science) and gray literature sources (Google Scholar). Search strategies combined keywords related to \"geomagnetic field,\" \"quantum biology,\" \"biofield,\" \"Traditional Chinese Medicine,\" and \"Qi.\" Included studies were categorized by domain and research design. Thematic synthesis was employed to identify convergent mechanisms and epistemological linkages across domains. Quantitative and experimental studies demonstrate significant effects of the activity of these three energetic domains on different scales within the human organism. Findings related to the GMFD include: neurophysiological modulation through human magnetoreception, with alpha-band desynchronization (p < 0.05); autonomic regulation under ultra-low frequency geomagnetic oscillations (0.00330.04 Hz) and autonomic rhythms (r = 0.46, p < 0.01); significant reductions in leukocyte (17.5 cells/mm³ per IQR increase in IMF, p < 0.001) and neutrophil counts associated with geomagnetic disturbances (Kp index); and impacts on fetal development, with increases in head circumference before 24 weeks ( = 0.04, p < 0.05) and reductions thereafter ( = 0.25, p < 0.01). Quantum biological processes (e.g., coherence, tunneling, and chromophore-based magnetoreception) and Biofield Therapies provided complementary evidence for the energetic continuum within the QFD and HBFD, respectively, consistent with the conceptual attributes of Qi. The integration of these energetic domains provides an innovative epistemological model aligned with the fundamental principles of TCM. This synthesis contributes to an evidence framework that supports the scientific legitimacy of TCM and its inclusion in integrative health approaches.",

    "abstract": "This thesis research carried out research to guide educational practice in Integrative and Complementary Health Practices - ICHP- for children and adolescents in non-formal education space and, potentially, in Basic Education schools in Brazil. We start from the question: Can the teaching of ICHP associated with the ArtScience methodological approach boost the ability to transpose the meanings of violence from socially vulnerable territories to the promotion of health and well-being, self-care and a culture of peace The study was approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee (REC-IOC/Fiocruz) under Certificate of Presentation of Ethical Appraisal - CAAE number: 45637621.6.0000.5248. Let us conduct a literature review on the effect of ICHP on children and young people in order to construct a guide to ICHP. We carried out a case study taking as object the Project 'Children Sun of Tomorrow -CST', carried out at the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation. We used documentary research to collect data from the perspective of Health Promotion and Education of ICHP with ArtScience. The CST project was carried out at Horto Fiocruz in 2018 with 80 participants and activities aimed at children and adolescents aged 8 to 15 years, their families and educators from social projects supported by Fiocruz, in areas with high violence in Rio de Janeiro (communities of Manguinhos, Complexo do Alemão, Cidade de Deus). The project carried out activities in a circuit of ICHP in Reiki, Tai Chi Chuan, Breathing, Meditation and Yoga stations, complementing with Environmental Education, ArtScience. We analyze the perception of positive and negative feelings before, during, and after the activities through the collection of words and the construction of a Metaformation, an approach that uses symbolic elements. Using the 13 cognitive categories promoting creativity (CCPC), the potential of ICHP to promote creativity was analyzed. Our results showed that ICHP promoted positive feelings and well-being in the educational dynamics, as well as were able to promote creativity, and could facilitate innovations in teaching. The teaching of ICHP for self-care, health and well-being of children and adolescents from areas exposed to violence has contributed to the Culture of Peace and can be designed for promoção da saúde. Other social projects can benefit from and achieve these goals.",

    "abstract": "The Brazilian regulation on dynamized medicines, initially homeopathic, began in 1965 and ever since received modifications to adapt this class of medicines in the country with a rich legislative history that established the processes for registration, notification, and classification of each class of dynamized medicines. To demonstrate the advances of these medications in Brazilian regulation, this work will describe, in a timeline, the importance and impact of each new published resolution related to the dynamized medications, discussing the historical context, in addition to comparing the current legislation with the international regulatory standards defined by the FDA and EMA. The work adopts a qualitativo approach, using bibliographic review instruments and document analysis. The present paper consulted public legal databases (ANVISA; VISALEGIS; FDA; EMA; EUR-Lex). Regarding the databases for the bibliographic review, scientific articles and journals were used with the objective of adding historical context to the discussion of the regulatory process for dynamized medicines. As for the legal public databases, the ANVISA 'legislation consultation' page was used to access the updated regulations on the legal processes for dynamized medicines. The legal recognition of dynamized medicines in Brazil began in 1965 with Decree nº 57.477 and it received various updates with the Collegiate Board Resolutions of ANVISA (RDCs) nº 139/03, RDC nº 26/07, RDC nº 238/18, and RDC nº. 721/22. The updates established greater parameters for the production, distribution, and use of dynamized medicines in a safe and authorized manner based on the regulations imposed by the legislation regarding registration/notification, registration renewal, and post-registration changes. Furthermore, these advancements legally introduce anthroposophic and anti-homotoxic medications, which contribute to expanding the legal framework for dynamized medicines in Brazil. In comparison with International Legislation, Brazilian Legislation presents a greater level of detail and distinction of anthroposophic and anti-homotoxic medicines, while European Legislation (European Directive 2001/83) does not mention these medicines in its text and the American legislation (FD&C Act, 1938) considers that dynamized medicines fall under the category of 'new drugs' and that any new drug that fails to prove its efetividade will be considered an 'unapproved new drug'. These factors contribute to international manufacturers of dynamized medicines having difficulty in fitting their products into current legislation. After more than 50 years since the legal recognition of homeopathic medicines in Brazil, the legislation has received updates to better classify dynamized medicines for their registration/notification. When compared to the legislation of other countries, Brazilian legislation has been able to distinguish between homeopathic, anthroposophic, and anti-homotoxic drugs, a regulatory advance that is still evolving in the rest of the world.",

    "abstract": "The use of psychoactive substances is frequently associated with high levels of ansiedade, creating a self-perpetuating cycle of emotional distress and chemical dependency. Brief therapeutic strategies that are feasible in health services with limited resources are essential to promote comprehensive and ac-cessible care. In this context, Interpersonal Nursing Theory, combined with atenção plena-based practi-ces such as conscious breathing, has shown promising potential in managing ansiedade among individu-als with substance use disorders. This mixed-method feasibility study employed standardized tools to assess ansiedade (GAD-7) and pat-terns of substance use (ASSIST), along with semi-structured interviews to explore the acceptability, demand, implementation, and practicality of the intervenção. Participants demonstrated a significant reduction in ansiedade scores at the end of the intervenção. They also reported increased body awareness, improved sleep quality, and decreased urgency to use psychoactive substances. The intervenção was considered feasible and practical, with 61.54% of par-ticipants utilizing the techniques offered. It was also rated as easy to implement and well-accepted by participants. These findings suggest that conscious breathing, even when applied in brief sessions, can have a meaningful clinical impact on ansiedade symptoms and substance use behavior. Integrating min-dfulness practices into brief intervençãos in substance use contexts represents a promising innovation, particularly for mental health and atenção primária settings. Conscious breathing, as a tool for emotional regulation, may enhance personal autonomy and reduce relapse triggered by ansiedade. The study highlights the need for further research with larger samples and more rigorous designs, such as ran-domized controlled trials, to consolidate this approach as a component of public mental health strate-gies. The brief intervenção using conscious breathing proved to be a viable, accessible, and effective strate-gy for managing ansiedade in individuals who use psychoactive substances. Its good acceptability and low operational cost point to a scalable solution for expanding mental healthcare services. Consolida-ting this practice may contribute significantly to relapse prevenção and the promotion of autonomy among service users.",

    "abstract": "This presentation will provide an overview of the principles required for advancing evidence-informed decision-making (EIDM) in the field of Traditional, Complementary and Integrative Medicine (TCIM). Key conceptssuch as knowledge diversity, evidential pluralism, decoloniality, and epistemic justiceneeded to understand the specificities of incorporating TCIM in the EIDM process will be reviewed with reference to the principles of baseado em evidence medicine. Illustrative examples of EIDM in TCIM from across the globe will showcase the range of knowledge approaches, forms of evidence, and policy intervençãos that address key problems of saúde pública relevance. Building on the WHO´s existing model of EIDM and informed by the work of Nugruho and colleagues, the authors developed a Trifocal Model of EIDM. The model is designed to account for the diverse forms of evidence needed in the real world to make people-centred, culturally-responsive, and contextually-appropriate clinical and policy decisions. The model was tested using a series of TCIM-focused case studies from across all six WHO global regions. The three forms of evidence highlighted in the Trifocal Model are: Research Evidence, Expert Evidence and Community Evidence. These categories align with the three pillars of baseado em evidence medicine, but account more explicitly for TCIM knowledges, non-statistical research paradigms, and a range of marginalized perspectives often unconsidered in decision-making. The TCIM case studies highlight the multiple ways in which each of these forms of evidence may be used in contextually-relevant ways to inform policy and practice. The Trifocal Model, which responds to long-standing calls for more epistemically-inclusive and socially-just decision-making models, has the potential to be applied not only to TCIM contexts, but more broadly in health decision-making. Further research will be needed to explore the models applications, including how decision-makers may navigate the tensions arising between different knowledges and evidentiary perspectives.",

This study aimed to analyze how TCIM is represented in scientific production on womens health, identifying hegemonic trends, silences, and counter-hegemonic possibilities for reconfiguring care practices. A scoping review was conducted following the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) methodology, with searches performed in ten national and international databases, covering publications without language or time restrictions. A total of 2,474 articles were identified, of which 1,079 met the eligibility criteria for addressing TCIM in the context of womens health. The analytical process was guided by Cultural Studies, using an expanded Circuit of Culture model that incorporated six analytical dimensions: representation, production/counter-production, consumption, identity, regulation, and sensoriality. This framework enabled a critical and contextualized reading of the discourses produced around TCIM and womens health, examining the tensions between different rationalities of care and knowledge production. The analysis revealed that most scientific production focuses on TCIM practices related to the pregnancy-puerperal cycle and menopause, reinforcing a fragmented and biologically centered view of womens health. There is a strong emphasis on therapeutic efficacy, clinical resultados, and physiological parameters, with TCIM often framed as complementary techniques to biomedical care, validated through hegemonic scientific protocols. This predominance reflects a broader alignment with market-driven and biomedical rationalities. However, within the reviewed literature, approximately 6.1% of the studies presented broader, critical perspectives that questioned biomedical centrality and incorporated discussions on autonomy, therapeutic bonding, culturally situated care, and ancestral knowledge. These studies represent counter-hegemonic approaches that highlight TCIM as a field capable of expanding care practices toward more subjective, relational, and integral dimensions of womens health. The findings underscore the strategic role of TCIM as a space of epistemological dispute and potential for reconfiguring care models historically shaped by biomedical reductionism. The study highlights the need to broaden the epistemological foundations guiding womens healthcare and research. It reinforces the importance of incorporating plural, culturally sensitive, and contextually grounded knowledge systems into scientific production on TCIM. By exposing the limitations of biomedical paradigms and recognizing alternative epistemologies, this review contributes to advancing cognitive justice and promoting more integral and equity-oriented care practices for womens health. Future research should prioritize frameworks capable of capturing the complexity, diversity, and symbolic dimensions inherent to TCIM and womens healthcare.",

    "abstract": "Folk medicine, also known as traditional medicine, is an ancient cultural practice based on beliefs and experiences passed down through generations. In Brazil, the religious healing practice performed by traditional local blessing-givers is an example of folk medicine that operates within two interrelated domains of socio-cultural life: (i) the religious domain, in which prayer is regarded as a healing instrument, and (ii) the healthcare domain, where healing rituals aim to contribute to patients' physical well-being. Since integrative and complementary practices are officially recognized within the Brazilian Unified Health System, this study aimed to evaluate the efetividade and legitimacy of blessing as a complementary terapia in Brazil. A qualitativo, interview-based study was conducted in 2024 in the metropolitan area of Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil, following approval by a research ethics committee (CAAE 79050524.0.0000.0315). The study included blessing-givers (n = 5), patients (n = 10), physicians (n = 5), and a Catholic priest. Participants were identified using a snowball sampling method, in which interviewees referred other potential participants. Semi-structured interviews were conducted and recorded with participants consent. The data were transcribed and analyzed using Bardin's thematic content analysis and textual analysis with IRaMuTeQ (version 0.8 alpha 7). Interviews with blessing-givers and patients revealed that blessing is perceived as a voluntary practice rooted in a recognized spiritual gift, in which prayers are used to seek divine intervenção for healing. Physicians acknowledged that traditional medicine does not invalidate folk healing practices, considering blessing as part of the spiritual dimension of healthcare. According to the priest, the Catholic Church accepts blessing as long as it aligns with faith principles and promotes both spiritual and community well-being. This study challenges the notion of rejection and marginalization of non-scientific health practices. Our findings indicate that blessing is a valid and effective complementary practice, potentially contributing to the connection between spirituality, health, and integrative medicine in Brazil.",

    "abstract": "Integrative medicine aims to improve health resultados by combining conventional and traditional therapeutic strategies. However, selecting the most appropriate combination for each individual remains challenging. This study aimed to develop and evaluate a stratified care algorithm based on the assessment of individual homeostatic capacity using electrodermal activity (EDA). We evaluated 150 participants using a proprietary EDA method, which measures physiological stability across biologically active zones. Functional testing involved bioresonance stimulation using a specialized diagnostic and therapeutic hardware-software system. Based on the degree of EDA stability, participants were stratified into five groups: from group 1 with very high stability to group 5 with very low stability. Each group was assigned tailored therapeutic strategies involving either integrative medicine alone or in combination with conventional medical care. Groups 1 and 2: Demonstrated strong homeostatic resilience. These individuals experienced symptom relief with integrative methods alone, such as bioresonance terapia, manual techniques, and lifestyle adjustments, typically within one to three sessions. Group 3: Often presented with acute-phase illness. These patients required additional diagnostics and acute care, with optimal resultados observed using multidisciplinary integrative approaches. Groups 4 and 5: Exhibited impaired homeostasis, often with diagnosed chronic conditions under conventional care. Combined tratamento strategies that integrated traditional and conventional medicine were most effective in improving health and function. A 15-year longitudinal observational study on low back pain patients further validated the stratification model. Treatment resultados consistently correlated with EDA-based group assignment, supporting the utility of this approach in clinical decision-making. Preliminary assessment of homeostatic stability via EDA offers a practical, non-invasive method for guiding personalized integrative medicine. This stratified model enables more precise tratamento decisions, improves patient resultados, and supports resource optimization in clinical settings.",

    "abstract": "Anxiety is a natural human response that arises when possible threats are identified, promoting response from a situation considered dangerous and manifests itself through physical and mental symptoms. However, when ansiedade symptoms are severe and persistent, it can be potentially harmful. With regard to health professionals, especially nurses, ansiedade is a problem that has become more prevalent. It is therefore necessary to provide intervençãos to control ansiedade in this population, since it is a necessary part of the workforce and care in the health system. Anxiety symptoms can be managed in a number of ways. One of these options is complementary and alternative medicine , which seeks to promote and prevent health. The practice of atenção plena is increasingly studied in acadêmico research and has become popular. Mindfulness includes intentionally focusing attention on one's own thoughts, feelings, physical sensations and environment. The practice can be recommended for the management of ansiedade symptoms by directing attention to the present moment, breaking patterns of anxious thinking and excessive worry about the future. The aim of this study was to determine the efetividade of atenção plena for managing ansiedade symptoms in nursing staff and stress as a secondary resultado. A revisão sistemática with metanálise following the recommendations of the JBI. The databases searched were MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, CINAHL, Web of Science, Scopus and Psycinfo. The search was carried out in October 2022. Independent reviewers used standardized methods to search, screen and code the included studies. Data metanálise was performed using random effects models. Grading of Recomendações, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) was used as an approach to assess the quality and certainty of evidence in research studies. The review examined the efetividade of atenção plena on nursing staff in 13 studies. The metanálise revealed a statistically significant decrease in ansiedade and stress after tratamento, with an average reduction of 0.36 in ansiedade and 0.48 in stress. The results emphasizes the possibility of atenção plena being an effective intervenção to the management of ansiedade and stress in nursing staff. However, the studies analyzed presented limitations in the design and sampling in the development of the intervenção, which impact the conclusive statements about the efetividade of atenção plena and the generalization of the results. The implications to the nursing field involve adopting baseado em evidence research and practices to improve the well-being and qualidade de vida of nursing professionals, as well as strengthening the evidence base surrounding atenção plena intervençãos in nursing practice. This may lead to changes in healthcare policies , care practices, and recognition of the importance of nurses' well-being for effective healthcare delivery.",

    "abstract": "Scoping reviews have been increasingly recognized as valuable strategies for mapping scientific evidence across diverse fields. However, conventional approaches often reproduce descriptive and methodologically neutral perspectives, limiting critical engagement with the symbolic, political, and epistemic dimensions of scientific production. This study proposes a scoping review model, following the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) guidelines, while critically tensioning each stage through the theoretical and methodological lens of Cultural Studies. Developed from empirical research on Traditional, Complementary, and Integrative Medicine (TCIM) and womens health, the model integrates technical rigor with critical analysis of language, power, and representation, fostering contextualized and epistemologically plural interpretations of science as a culturally and politically situated practice. The methodology articulates the scoping review model of the JBI with theoretical and methodological contributions from Cultural Studies. This represents a shift from scoping reviews as a merely descriptive exercise to a critical, ethical, and politically engaged process. Each stagefrom the formulation of the research question to data analysisis traversed by epistemological choices attentive to language, representation, and power dynamics. Data extraction involves the analysis of discursive elements such as vocabulary, legitimizing devices, silences, and narrative absences within scientific publications. The analytical process is guided by an expanded Circuit of Culture model, covering six dimensions: representation, production/counter-production, consumption, identity, regulation, and sensoriality. This methodological proposal expands the interpretative potential of scoping reviews by enabling critical readings of how certain forms of scientific knowledge are legitimized, silenced, or contested in the literature. It highlights key contributions such as the valorization of plural epistemologies, the inclusion of historically marginalized voices, and the displacement of methodological neutrality. The model proposes that each stage of the review processfrom the formulation of the research question to data analysisbe traversed by ethical-political decisions, requiring active researcher engagement and fostering investigations that are more situated, critical, and sensitive to the symbolic and epistemic disputes that shape science as a cultural practice. Reflexivity thus emerges as a fundamental axis for confronting the epistemological silences and disputes inherent in knowledge productionan aspect of particular relevance, especially in the field of TCIM. The scoping review model oriented by Cultural Studies reconfigures the investigative process by combining methodological rigor with critical, context-sensitive analysis. By recognizing scientific production as a symbolic and contested field, this approach enhances methodological reflexivity, expands analytical research possibilities, and contributes to knowledge production practices committed to cognitive justice and epistemological pluralismespecially in the field of TCIM.",

    "abstract": "The World Health Organization (WHO) recognizes medicinal plants as a fundamental therapeutic resource. In Brazil, this is institutionalized within the Unified Health System (SUS) through two key policies. The National Policy on Integrative and Complementary Practices (PNPIC, 2006) incorporates traditional practices into all levels of healthcare to promote a more holistic approach. Concurrently, the National Policy on Medicinal Plants and Herbal Medicines (PNPMF, 2006) aims to ensure safe, rational access to these resources by validating and integrating traditional knowledge. Within this framework, the university extension project \"Shared Knowledge: Dialogues between Traditional Medicine and Collective Health\" operates. Developed by students at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ) in the Salles Netto Family Clinic, the project applies these national policies at the atenção primária level, seeking to honor traditional knowledge while strengthening community-health service bonds. The project uses a participatory action research methodology centered on horizontal dialogue between students and the community. This approach is essential for documenting local perspectives and project impacts. Activities, including conversation circles and workshops, are held at the medicinal garden space at the Salles Netto atenção primária unit in Rio de Janeiro. The project's anticipated resultados are analyzed through two interconnected axes. The first is Community Empowerment through Popular Health Education. Inspired by Paulo Freire's pedagogy (1987), which values dialogue and life experience, the project positions community members as active subjects in constructing their own health. This validates their traditional knowledge, moving beyond a top-down educational model and recognizing the power of popular wisdom (Diehl et al., 2021). The second axis is the promotion of Rational Use of Medicinal Plants and Health Benefits. The project integrates traditional knowledge with scientific evidence to ensure segurança and efficacy, a core goal of the PNPMF. This dialogue helps mitigate the risks of improper self-medication and promotes the use of plants to manage common chronic conditions, corroborating studies on the use of fitoterapia in atenção primária (Santos et al., 2023). The garden serves as a living laboratory where different forms of knowledge converge to improve qualidade de vida. This experience shows that community medicinal gardens are powerful tools for implementing national health policies at the grassroots level. They are dynamic spaces for promoção da saúde, popular education, and strengthening community ties. The project reinforces that integral healthcare requires recognizing and integrating diverse forms of knowledge. Future steps include systematizing shared knowledge and conducting workshops on sustainable remedies to ensure the project's long-term impact.",

    "abstract": "Our research aims to present an empirical study focused on the practice of caring for individuals experiencing severe psychological suffering. It seeks to reflect on the importance of group work grounded in Analytical Psychology, utilizing traditional fairy tales. This work demonstrates an intervenção strategy with individuals experiencing severe psychological suffering, through group work using traditional fairy tales grounded in Carl Gustav Jung's Analytical Psychology (1875-1961). The proposal consists of four stages: Nigredo, Albedo, Citrinitas, and Rubedo, which guide the development of the therapeutic process using fairy tales. To this end, we conducted a study in primary healthcare at the Reference Center for Anthroposophic Medicine (CRMA), part of the Brazilian Unified Health System (SUS), in the city of São João del Rei, MG. The research was approved by the ethics committee of UFSJ, CAAE: 40240520.6.0000.5151. The research corpus comprises records of group experiences with traditional fairy tales, involving individuals with severe psychological suffering, during the years 2021, 2022, and 2023. These records include narratives documented in the researchers field diaries, as well as drawings and paintings created by the participants. The weekly group sessions with traditional fairy tales lasted three hours. The groups systematic approach included a warm welcome, a ritual, reading a fairy tale, reflection, a snack, and an artistic activity. The collected data were subjected to analysis from a qualitativo research perspective. The narratives and artistic works were categorized into four main axes: social adaptation, coping strategies for psychological suffering, social skills, and relationship skills. Based on these categories, a thematic analysis was conducted, allowing for a deeper understanding of how individuals interpret and face their experiences of psychological suffering, as well as their ways of social integration. One of the main benefits we observed in the Traditional Fairy Tale Group was emotional support - an opportunity to receive emotional backing from other members of the group, to learn from others' experiences and coping strategies, thereby fostering social adaptation. It served as a space for peer interaction, an exercise in existence grounded in affective bonds that encourage individuals to engage in the social environment, with reverberations in family and community life. When analyzing the stages of work with fairy tales, we noted the active involvement of participants in the therapeutic process, evidenced by their expanded reflection on their life experiences through dialogue with the images produced. Furthermore, we can infer that, in the Albedo phase, all unconscious mental manifestations are present, reinforcing the efetividade of the amplification method proposed in Carl Gustav Jung's Analytical Psychology. This stage demonstrated how the integration of these manifestations contributed to a deeper understanding of the unconscious, strengthening the process of self-knowledge and social adaptation. The narrative analysis enabled exploration of nuances, emotions, and meanings attributed by each participant to their experiences, enriching the interpretation of the results.",

Methods: A longitudinal mixed-methods case study was conducted in 2025 with a subsample of 53 participants from seven cohorts of the MBHP program conducted at TRT-BA held since 2022, which included awareness-raising lectures, 12 hours of in-person training per cohort, and eight weeks of online follow-up (n = 167). Participants completed the SRQ-20, WHO-5, and ASAS-R scales pre- and post-intervenção. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, and stratified analysis by sex and work modality) and inferential statistics (paired Students t-tests; Pearsons correlation; Fishers r-to-z transformation; and McNemars test). Ethics approval for implementing MBHP with the Brazilian population was granted under protocol 43093115.8.0000.5505. Results/Discussion: The average age was 47 years (SD = 7.37). The MBHP reduced levels of mental distress and future risk, while improving well-being among the target population, with stronger effects observed among women in hybrid work settings. Mental health risk was negatively associated with well-being and self-care, and self-care was positively associated with well-being. These results were statistically significant (p < .05), except for the magnitude of correlation strength (p > .05). The MBHP proved acceptable and feasible, meeting recruitment (95.4%) and session attendance (88.3%) benchmarks, though the retention rate (51%) fell slightly short, indicating the need for future adjustments. Conclusions/Final Considerations: The implementation of MBHP demonstrated its acceptability, feasibility, and efetividade in reducing mental distress and future risk, as well as in promoting well-being, especially among women in hybrid work settings. The initiative presents a promising model of institutional care with potential for replication across the Judiciary, fostering healthier and more productive work environments.",

    "abstract": "Introduction: The judiciary has a high prevalence of work leave due to mental disorders. In parallel, atenção plena-based intervençãos and trial-based cognitive terapia have demonstrated evidence of efetividade in promoting health and well-being across diverse populations. However, no records of such intervençãos exist within the judiciary. Objective: To examine the acceptability, feasibility, and efetividade of individual and online intervençãos based on atenção plena and trial-based cognitive terapia (M-TBCT) to promote psychological well-being in the judiciary. Methods: Two sequential studies are being conducted. The first is a qualitativo feasibility and acceptability study of the Mindfulness Integrated with Trial-Based Cognitive Therapy (M-TBCT) protocol, with a sample of 30 participants. Data collection is complete and under analysis. The second is an ongoing randomized controlled trial with 90 participants, 45 assigned to the M-TCP group and 45 to a waitlist control. The intervenção is delivered individually and online, consisting of eight weekly one-hour sessions. Assessments occur at baseline (T0), post-intervenção (T1), and six-month follow-up (T2). Results/Discussion: In Study 1, acceptability will be assessed through a self-report questionnaire, and feasibility will be measured via recruitment, session attendance, and retention rates. In Study 2, psychological well-being will be assessed using the WHO-5, mental health through the PHQ-9 (depressão) and GAD-7 (ansiedade), and self-care through the ASAS-R. Expected resultados include reduced ansiedade and depressão, increased self-care, and sustained improvements at six-month follow-up. The study received ethics approval from the UNIFESP Research Ethics Committee (CAAE 73817423.3.0000.5505) and was registered in the Brazilian Clinical Trials Registry (REBEC) prior to data collection. Conclusions/Final Considerations: The implementation of M-TCP in the judiciary is expected to generate evidence supporting effective and cost-efficient intervençãos, aligned with NR-1, the Regulatory Standard mandating prevenção of psychosocial risks and promotion of workplace health. The protocol may also strengthen interpersonal connections and work-family balance, with potential for expansion to other courts within the judiciary, as well as to other public and private institutions.",

    "abstract": "The colonial power relations as a product of modernity imposed by territorial invasions in the Southern Hemisphere, are a result of violence and erasure that have repercussions in all spheres of life. Its impact on health is through the biomedical model, which treats the body as an object without subjectivity and care as a commodity in dispute. Seeking to overcome this legacy, the National Policy for Healthcare for Indigenous Peoples (PNASPI) instituted Differentiated Care (AD), which recognizes different indigenous cultures as legacies that must be valued to ensure the continuity of knowledge, practices, care, and values in integration with the care practices offered by the Indigenous Healthcare Subsystem (SASI-SUS). The real challenge of AD is to transform the encounter between the biomedical practices of SASI-SUS and the Ancestral Sciences of Care for Indigenous Peoples into a productive and powerful crossroads, where different ways of doing science are mutually respected. For this to happen, it is essential to map and understand the care technologies of these peoples. In this context, the project \"Technologies of Indigenous Care: Participatory mapping of specialists in indigenous medicine in the State of Ceará\", developed in partnership by Fiocruz and DSEI-CE, maps specialists (midwives, shamans, and prayers). The initiative seeks to give practical meaning to AD, promoting the alliance of this knowledge with SASI-SUS and, crucially, subsidizing with information about the indigenous peoples of Ceará the Working Group on Indigenous Medicines (GT/MI), established by SESAI to create a national program. Research began in June 2025 and will be completed in November 2025. Because of this, this work analyzes the impact of initial training and will present a preview of the results of the mapping interviews. To begin mapping activities, indigenous scholarship recipients were selected via a public notice. Following the selection a training course took place for selected indigenous researchers aiming to align their understanding of the project and the methodology for developing the activities. Eleven scholarship holders were selected to be indigenous mapping researchers. The training course was held in May 2025, with the presence of all scholarship holders, members of DSEI  CE and the project team. The course was designed as a training moment, focused on interaction between and among participants, from a dialogical perspective of knowledge construction. It included spaces on indigenous health, indigenous medicines and care technologies, addressed ways of mapping, presentation of the instruments to be used, practical time for scholarship holders to experience conducting interviews alongside people from the indigenous territory and a moment for planning activities. The training course contributed to the leveling of the scholarship holders regarding the project and its methodology. With the development of the activities by the scholarship holders, it is expected that all interviews with midwives and specialists from the indigenous territories of the state of Ceará will be completed by December. The mapping will contribute to strengthen the SASI-SUS in Ceará, guiding the Specialized Care to be referenced by indigenous health specialists.",

    "abstract": "Pregnancy brings various anatomical and physiological changes, often causing uncomfortable symptoms. Aromaterapia, an integrative practice using essential oils, may offer relief, but it has not been systematically reviewed. While numerous individual studies and reviews have examined the potential benefits of aromaterapia during pregnancy, findings remain inconsistent due to variations in study design, essential oil types, and administration methods. Aim: To evaluate the efetividade of aromaterapia in reducing physiological and psychological symptoms during pregnancy. We followed the methodological guidelines of the JBI for Systematic Reviews of Effectiveness and PRISMA. Experimental and quasi-experimental studies involving pregnant women who received aromaterapia for managing physiological or psychological symptoms during pregnancy were included. Nine databases were searched on January 2022 and August 2024 and included MEDLINE (PubMed), CINAHL, SCOPUS (Elsevier), and Web of Science, resulting in 1063 citations. Two independent reviewers conducted screening, used JBI critical appraisal tools to develop risk of bias tables, and developed a data extraction. Conflicts were resolved through discussion. 21 studies were included (16 randomised ensaio clínicos and five quasi-experimental), conducted in Iran, Indonesia, Japan, and Taiwan. The metanálise showed that aromaterapia significantly reduced symptoms of nausea and vomiting (SMD = -0.92; 95% CI: -1.09, -0.74) and maternal ansiedade (SMD = -0.67; 95% CI: -0.95, -0.40). Positive effects on sleep quality were also observed (MD = -1.55; 95%CI: -2.09, -1.01). No effects were found for fatigue, low back pain, pruritus and induction of labour. This revisão sistemática and metanálise suggest that aromaterapia is beneficial in alleviating gestational symptoms such as: Nausea and vomiting, sleep disturbances, and maternal ansiedade, thus reinforcing aromaterapias role as a CAM intervenção. The findings support the potential of aromaterapia to promote holistic well-being, addressing physical, emotional, and mental health concerns beyond biological conditions. But further need for larger sample sizes is critical. Additionally, blinding of aromaterapia tratamentos can be difficult to achieve, thus increasing the risk of bias.",

    "abstract": "Menopause is a biological stage in the life of every woman, beginning around the age of 35-40, marked by the transition between the reproductive and non-reproductive phases, resulting from the progressive follicular depletion of the ovaries, which leads to a decrease in the production of the hormones estrogen (estradiol) and progesterone, and an increase in the levels of the gonadotropins FSH and LH, changes that can result in Climacteric Syndrome, a set of signs and symptoms that negatively impact the qualidade de vida of this population. Among some possibilities for intervenção, Integrative and Complementary Health Therapies (PICS) have been used in healthcare, not only because they show signs of beneficence, but also because they have fewer contraindications and harmful effects, in addition to being low cost. Integrative review on the use of PICS that are part of the National Policy of Integrative and Complementary Practices of the Brazilian Ministry of Health (PNPICS) in the healthcare of climacteric women. The search for articles with primary data was carried out in the MEDLINE database. Fifty-five articles were selected both from intervençãoal and observational studies, which investigated 10 different PICS: Phytoterapia, Yoga, Acupuncture, Meditation, Aromaterapia, Hypnoterapia, Apiterapia, Homeopathy, Naturopathy, and Chiropractic. These studies were produced by researchers from 16 countries, with emphasis on the United States with 11 articles (focused on Hypnoterapia and the practice of Yoga), followed by Brazil with 8, Iran with 8 (including all five on Aromaterapia), China with 7 (or 8, if Taiwan is included), India with 6, and Italy with 4. Almost all of the studies that were part of this review demonstrated benefits, most with statistical significance, both in reducing climacteric symptoms and improving the qualidade de vida of the participants. These findings support the view that PICS should be considered an effective adjuvant option in the healthcare of climacteric women, an interpretation that is in line with the concept of Integrative Health.",

    "abstract": "Integrative and Complementary Health Practices (PICS), also known worldwide as Traditional, Complementary and Integrative Medicine (TCIM), are supported in Brazil by a national policy (that presents 29 recognized practices), but they are still not fully disseminated in the Unified Health System, and there is possibility for expansion in the Unified Health System (SUS) units. Therefore, in Brazil, strategies aimed at training health professionals have been carried out with a view to expanding PICS/TCIM in the SUS. This research comes from a project carried out in partnership between the university, the city government of Niteroi (Rio de Janeiro) and the university support foundation, which has three main stages: mapping of health units, training professionals, and expanding PICS/TCIM in the municipality. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of PICS/TCIM training on the qualidade de vida of health professionals in the municipality. This is an observational, longitudinal and prospective study, which used the validated WHO-QoL-bref questionnaire to assess qualidade de vida before training (time zero) and after 9 months of training (time 1). The training carried out during the study period were: reiki, yoga, circular dance, reflexology, aromaterapia and floral terapia. The study presents partial data obtained from 19 participants who signed a consent form. The score was presented as a percentage. The protocol was approved by a Brazilian Research Ethics Committee (CAAE 35883220.0.0000.5289). This study presents the preliminary results concerning the four domains (physical, psychological, social relations and environment), as well as self-assessment, of the WHO-QoL-bref questionnaire, considering time zero and time 1. There was an increase in all the domains (physical: 68.03 to 70.11; psychological: 73.00 to 79.45; social relations: 65.25 to 78.70; environment: 64.6 to 78.4) and in self-assessment qualidade de vida (65 to 70.55). In the results showed, the psychological, social and environmental domains stood out, which possibly reflects an improvement in the participating professionals' perception of their well-being and working conditions. In addition, the overall score of the questionnaire also increased from 68 to 72.95. Although the study has a limitation, due to the small number of participants, it is possible to observe that the PICS/TCIM training promoted a positive impact on the trained professionals, considering that many of them use these tools directed at self-care, promoting awareness of healthcare and how to deal with daily events. It is suggested that the improved qualidade de vida of the professionals could lead to better care for SUS patients, with more effective service performance. Furthermore, it is suggested that more studies be carried out in the area in order to verify the effects of training for health professionals.",

This complexity has led to a growing interest in integrative therapies (IT), such as Pranic Healing (PH), a non-invasive energy-based technique. Objective: To evaluate the efetividade of Pranic Healing as an adjunctive terapia for dor crônica management. This is a retrospective and cross-sectional study conducted between 2011 and 2013, involving 203 participants (both male and female), aged between 10 and 90 years, all experiencing symptoms of dor crônica. Pain intensity was assessed using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS). All participants underwent a PH session, seated one meter in front of the therapist. After identifying energy imbalances in the physical body, internal organs, and the 11 major chakras, advanced PH techniques and Pranic Psychoterapia were applied. The therapist used a transparent quartz crystal in one hand to remove imbalanced energy, and a quartz sphere in the other to enhance the absorption of vital energy. Results: A statistically significant reduction in pain was observed after a single PH session (p < 0.001), both in the overall sample and when analyzed by age group and gender (p < 0.001). Discussion: Preliminary results suggest the therapeutic potential of Pranic Healing for dor crônica relief, highlighting the need for further research with more rigorous methodological design. Conclusion: Pranic Healing proved effective in reducing dor crônica symptoms and may serve as a valuable complementary approach in integrative pain management strategies",

In this context, we assume that specific municipal policies aimed at traditional and integrative care (CTI) can favor the organization and development of their provision in PHC services. In view of this, we carried out an action research (AR), the objective of which was to analyze the demands of the collective formulation process of a proposal for a Municipal Policy for Integrative and Complementary Practices (PMPIC), together with key actors. The action research was conducted with 18 participants involved in the provision of these therapeutic approaches in the SUS, from six municipalities that are members of the Regional Health Department III (DRS III) of the state of São Paulo. Data were collected through documentary analysis of records from the year 2023, from a service-teaching-management integration working group, involved in the implementation of practices present in the PNPIC, in the SUS of their municipalities, and from eight workshops held in 2024. Data analysis followed Dick's (2002) proposal of confirmation and disconfirmation of data in action research, based on the dialectical process. It is worth emphasizing that a recent mapping in DRS III shows that of the 24 member municipalities, 20 offer in the SUS some practice present in the PNPIC. The results show that the process demands highlighted were strategies for the implementation of both the PICs and their municipal policy, aimed at: dissemination of information about the PICs and the municipal policy; the need for reports, indicators, and financial resources; access to and organization of flows; and demands for collective discussion spaces and SUS devices such as the Municipal Health Council and the National Council of Municipal Health Secretaries. The creation of the PMPIC proposal reflected the desires, knowledge and local needs of workers, managers and civil society, in the writing of the policy they wish to see implemented, consolidating a legitimate, plural technical product anchored in the principles of the PNPIC. The moments of listening, critical analysis and collective validation confirmed the transformative potential of action research, promoting the empowerment of participants and strengthening the public sense of healthcare. The collective elaboration of the PMPIC proposal proved to be a political, transformative pedagogical path that rescues the political and humanized sense of promoting traditional and integrative care in the SUS.",

    "abstract": "Chemoterapia-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) are among the most frequent and debilitating efeitos adversos of cancer tratamento, negatively impacting patient adherence and qualidade de vida. Auricular acupuntura may represent a promising complementary strategy; however, evidence from controlled ensaio clínicos remains limited. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of auricular acupuntura on the intensity of CINV in adults with cancer, compared to a sham intervenção. This was a parallel (1:1) randomized controlled trial conducted at an oncology center in southern Minas Gerais, Brazil. Participants were randomized in blocks of six using an online tool and allocated into two groups. The intervenção group received auricular acupuntura using mustard seeds applied to specific points related to nausea and vomiting. The sham group received black-painted cotton pieces affixed to auricular points unrelated to the condition under study, with inert stimulation. An acupuncturist with four years of experience administered five consecutive sessions in both groups. The resultado assessed was the intensity of the worst sensation of nausea and vomiting, measured using the Morrow Assessment of Nausea and Emesis (MANE) scale at three timepoints: T1 (before the intervenção), T2 (after five sessions), and T3 (fifteen days after the last session). Possible responses were: none, mild, moderate, and severe. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics (absolute and relative frequencies). The study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee (approval no. 5.688.449, CAAE: 60933422.0.0000.5142) and registered in the Brazilian Registry of Clinical Trials (ReBEC): RBR-5rp37x8. At baseline, severe nausea was reported by 46% of participants in the intervenção group and 48% in the sham group; severe vomiting was reported by 26% in both groups. At the second assessment, absence of nausea was reported by 40% in the intervenção group and 10% in the control group; absence of vomiting was reported by 70% and 62%, respectively. Severe nausea was reported by 12% in the intervenção group and 34% in the control group; severe vomiting by 4% and 18%. At the third assessment, absence of nausea was reported by 46% in the intervenção group and 14% in the control group; absence of vomiting by 78% and 60%, respectively. Severe nausea was reported by 14% in the intervenção group and 30% in the control group; severe vomiting by 4% and 18%. Although the data suggest a favorable trend for the intervenção group, these are preliminary and descriptive results. The absence of inferential analyses prevents conclusions regarding differences between groups or timepoints. Ongoing analyses aim to further investigate the intervenção's effects. The descriptive data obtained thus far suggest variations in the intensity of nausea and vomiting between the evaluated groups. However, as these are preliminary findings without inferential statistical analysis, it is not possible to assert differences between groups. Further studies with more robust statistical testing are necessary to evaluate the efetividade of auricular acupuntura in managing these symptoms.",

    "abstract": "Patients' expectations regarding the efetividade of acupuntura are a relevant psychological factor that may influence clinical responses to therapeutic intervençãos. In the context of auricular acupuntura for chemoterapia-induced nausea and vomiting, understanding the role of expectation can help minimize potential biases in ensaio clínicos. However, this aspect remains understudied. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the association between patients expectations regarding the efetividade of auricular acupuntura and the occurrence of nausea and vomiting. This was a secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial conducted at an oncology center in southern Minas Gerais, Brazil. One hundred patients with chemoterapia-induced nausea and vomiting were randomly allocated to one of two groups (1:1): the intervenção group (auricular acupuntura using mustard seeds at specific points) and the sham group (simulated auricular acupuntura with stimulation at non-specific points). Both groups received five weekly sessions. Expectation of efetividade was assessed prior to the intervenção using the question: Do you believe auricular acupuntura will influence your episodes of nausea and vomiting The association between expectation and the occurrence of nausea and vomiting was analyzed using descriptive statistics and Fishers exact test, with a significance level of 5%. The study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee (approval no. 5.688.449; CAAE: 60933422.0.0000.5142). Most participants reported believing in the efetividade of auricular acupuntura (90.0%). In the intervenção group, 86.0% of participants who believed in acupuntura reported nausea at baseline, and 52.0% at the final assessment. Among those who did not believe in acupuntura, the rates were 10.0% and 6.0%, respectively. In the sham group, among those who believed in acupuntura, 86.0% reported nausea at baseline and 82.0% at the final assessment. Among those who did not believe in acupuntura, 10.0% reported nausea at baseline and 8.0% at the final assessment. When analyzed by group and timepoint, no statistically significant associations were found between belief in the efetividade of acupuntura and the occurrence of nausea or vomiting at either baseline or final assessment (p > 0.05 for all tests). These findings highlight the importance of considering participants beliefs and expectations regarding intervençãos, particularly in ensaio clínicos involving Integrative and Complementary Health Practices. The findings suggest that although most participants reported positive expectations toward the intervenção, no statistical association was found between these expectations and the clinical resultados assessed. Future studies may focus on the development and validation of scales that more precisely measure expectations related to acupuntura practices.",

    "abstract": "Genitourinary Syndrome of Menopause (GSM) affects 27-84% of postmenopausal women, causing vaginal dryness, dyspareunia, and urinary symptoms due to hypoestrogenism. Non-hormonal alternatives are needed for women with contraindications to hormonal terapia. Brassica oleracea contains glucosinolates, flavonoids, and sulforaphane with demonstrated wound-healing, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and segurança of 10% Brassica oleracea glycolic extract cream versus standard vaginal moisturizer for GSM tratamento. Triple-blind, randomized, controlled ensaio clínico conducted at a quaternary university hospital. Inclusion criteria: postmenopausal women aged 50-65 years, amenorrhea 3 years, FSH >25 IU/mL, estradiol <20 pg/mL, clinically diagnosed GSM. Exclusion criteria: Brassicaceae allergy, active infections, hormone use <3 months. Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive either 10% Brassica oleracea glycolic extract cream (n=22) or standard moisturizer (n=18). Intravaginal application every 72 hours for 12 weeks. Primary resultados: Vaginal Health Index (VHI), Atrophy Symptoms Scale (ASS). Secondary resultados: Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI), Women's Health Questionnaire (WHQ). Safety assessed through hepatic and renal function tests. Statistical analysis used Mann-Whitney and Fisher's exact tests (=0.05). Ethics approval: CAAE 70147923.0.0000.0068. Mean age was 57.91±5.04 years (Brassica) vs 56.00±3.27 years (control). Brassica group showed significant VHI total improvement over time (baseline 16.70±4.49 to 18.22±3.99, p=0.0177) while control showed no significant change (p=0.2496). Between-group analysis revealed superior Brassica efficacy: VHI total difference 3.77±2.48 vs 1.05±3.9 (p=0.008), VHI secretion improvement (p=0.05). ASS total reduction was greater in Brassica group (-4.95±2.29 vs -3.33±2.02, p=0.049). FSFI showed significant Brassica improvements: satisfaction (p=0.016), arousal (p=0.032), lubrication (p=0.037), and pain reduction (p=0.038). No adverse events occurred; laboratory parameters remained stable. The superior efficacy of Brassica oleracea compared to standard moisturizers aligns with its unique bioactive profile. Glucosinolates are converted to isothiocyanates like sulforaphane, which activate the Nrf2 pathway and inhibit NF-B, reducing oxidative stress and inflammation in hypoestrogenic vaginal tissues. Unlike previous studies showing modest improvements with standard moisturizers, our formulation achieved clinically meaningful VHI increases (>3 points) and substantial ASS reductions. Regression analysis identified hysterectomized women and those with chronic symptoms as optimal responders, possibly due to enhanced tissue responsiveness to regenerative compounds. The 12-week intervenção period may explain superior resultados compared to shorter studies. Limitations include small sample size and baseline demographic differences between groups, though primary resultado measures were comparable. These findings suggest Brassica oleracea addresses both symptomatic relief and underlying tissue pathophysiology through tissue regeneration rather than temporary lubrication alone. Vaginal moisturizer containing 10% Brassica oleracea glycolic extract is a safe and effective non-hormonal alternative for GSM tratamento, significantly improving vaginal health, reducing atrophic symptoms, and enhancing sexual function in postmenopausal women.",

    "abstract": "Australian native fruits, known for their unique and diverse phytochemical compositions, have been a cornerstone of Indigenous Australian food and medicine for centuries. These fruits, with distinctive chemical profiles resulting from Australia's unique climatic conditions, hold significant potential to improve human health. This study investigated the in vitro antiproliferative properties of water (W) and ethanol (Et) extracts from Kakadu plum (KP), Illawarra plum (IP), Davidsons plum (DP), native currant (NC), and lemon aspen (LA) against the MCF7 breast adenocarcinoma cells. After tratamento with the active extracts, flow cytometry and reactive oxygen species (ROS) assays were employed to assess the levels of apoptosis induction and ROS generation in the MCF7 cells, respectively. The active extracts were also evaluated for their antioxidant potential using the ABTS and CUPRAC assays. Additionally, antimicrobial susceptibility tests were performed on the extracts against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Candida albicans. Finally, the potential bioactive metabolites in the selected active extracts were analysed using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) driven metabolomics. The results indicated dose-dependent antiproliferative (against MCF7 cells) and antioxidant (in the ABTS and CUPRAC assays) activities for the active extracts - KP-W, KP-Et, IP-Et, NC-W, NC-Et and LA-Et. Notably, the KP-W exhibited the lowest EC50 value of 0.20 µg/mL in the CUPRAC assay. All active extracts showed moderate antimicrobial activity against the tested pathogens. Moreover, KP-W, KP-Et, IP-Et, NC-W, NC-Et and LA-Et were found to induce apoptosis with a significant decline (p < 0.05) in the live MCF7 cell populations after 24 h of tratamento, compared to the untreated control. However, these active extracts had no significant impact on the levels of ROS (p> 0.05) in the MCF7 cells, compared to the untreated control. The metabolomic identification revealed an abundance of tannin, flavonoids, and triterpenoid compounds as potential bioactive metabolites in the KP extracts, while NC extracts were rich in flavonoids, fatty acyl derivatives, carbohydrates, carboxylic acids and their derivatives, and alkaloid compounds. The resultado serves as a foundation for future studies on these fruits as potential dietary and therapeutic intervençãos for breast cancer. Moreover, isolation and purification of active metabolites and assessing apoptotic protein expression levels using advanced assays are crucial in future studies.",

    "abstract": "The main objective is to assess the effects of a structured Kuchipudi dance session on breath rhythm and regulation, using biometric data to evaluate pre- and post-intervenção changes. Breath regulation is a foundational element across many traditional healing systems and has gained increasing attention in integrative medicine for its role in modulating the autonomic nervous system. Conscious breathing is known to impact heart rate variability, stress response, and emotional regulation. Practices like yoga and meditação incorporate intentional breath control to promote physiological balance. Indian classical dance, particularly Kuchipudi, shares parallels with such practices through its structured, rhythm-based movements synchronized with breath awareness. Kuchipudi is a classical Indian dance form rooted in the ancient texts Nyastra and Abhinaya Darpana, which articulate detailed frameworks for gesture (mudra), expression (abhinaya), and movement (karana). Traditionally performed as a blend of dance, drama, and music, Kuchipudi uses hand gestures, facial expressions, rhythmic footwork, and bodily transitions to convey narrative and emotion. While primarily appreciated as a performing art, Kuchipudi also inherently involves physical activity, mental focus, emotional expression, and breath coordinationqualities that may render it a potential complementary mind-body practice. Recent scholarship has begun to explore the therapeutic relevance of classical dance, examining its benefits in physical, psychological, and neurological domains. However, limited research exists on its direct impact on breath regulation as a measurable physiological resultado. This study addresses that gap by investigating the potential of Kuchipudi as a movement-based intervenção that supports respiratory stability. This study aimed to assess the effects of a structured Kuchipudi dance session on breath rhythm and regulation, using biometric data to evaluate pre- and post-intervenção changes. Thirty female participants (aged 1345) from a Kuchipudi dance school were recruited, each with prior training in basic postures, movements, and breathing patterns associated with the dance. A pulse oximeter was used to monitor beats per minute (bpm) before and after a guided 45-minute session. The session incorporated continuous movement sequences, including gestures, rhythmic footwork, and transitions performed with intentional breath awareness. The approach mirrored aspects of yogic movement terapia and aimed to align breath with bodily flow. Post-intervenção data revealed a measurable shift in participants breath-related physiological markers. While pre-session readings showed greater variability in bpm, post-session results indicated more stable, consistent breathing patterns. The observed changes suggest a shift toward autonomic regulation and a calming effect on the breath-heart connection. Participants also reported feeling more mentally centered and physically relaxed, although these were anecdotal and not formally measured. This preliminary study provides evidence that structured sessions of Kuchipudi dance, when performed with focused breath awareness, may contribute to improved breath regulation. These findings highlight the potential of Indian classical dance as a therapeutic complementary movement-based intervenção. Given its non-invasive, expressive, and engaging nature, Kuchipudi may offer a novel tool in integrative health approaches aimed at supporting respiratory, emotional, and neurological well-being. Further research with a larger sample size, control group, and broader physiological metrics (e.g., HRV, SpO, cortisol) is recommended to substantiate these initial findings and explore its clinical relevance.",

    "abstract": "Indian Classical Dance, an ancient art form rooted in the Nyastra and Abhinayadarpaa, is gaining global recognition not only as a cultural expression but also as a complementary therapeutic modality. These foundational treatises articulate that the practice of classical dance enhances core strength, balance, concentration, and internal energy flow. Of particular interest is Ntyathe expressive component of dance combining facial expressions (Abhinaya) and gestureswhich may activate emotional and cognitive circuits through intricate facial muscle engagement. This main objective of the study is to investigate the potential therapeutic benefits of expressive acting in Indian classical dance (Ntya), focusing on its impact on emotional regulation and ansiedade reduction. A quantitative, quasi-experimental research design was adopted. The study recruited 50 participants (ages 1650) from India and the USA who are currently undergoing Indian classical dance (Bharatanatyam) training. Participants practiced expressive acting through Abhinaya for 30 minutes daily over one month. Pre- and post-session stress and ansiedade levels were recorded using standardized self-report questionnaires, including the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and a custom mood regulation scale. The focus was to observe trends in self-perceived emotional states before and after each session. Preliminary findings suggest a measurable reduction in ansiedade and improved mood regulation among participants following the expressive movement sessions. Repetitive facial engagement, focused attention, and storytelling elements inherent in Abhinaya may activate parasympathetic pathways, aiding emotional catharsis and self-awareness. These effects mirror resultados typically associated with movement-based and atenção plena therapies. Abhinaya, as a structured and emotionally expressive component of Indian classical dance, offers potential as a complementary therapeutic intervenção. It holds promise particularly for mental well-being, emotional regulation, and stress relief. Bridging ancient dance theory with modern health science, this research advocates for the integration of expressive movement practices into holistic therapeutic frameworks within complementary and alternative medicine.",

    "abstract": "Globally, traditional and complementary medicine (TCM) plays a vital role in community health, especially in regions where indigenous practices are deeply embedded. In South Africa, African Traditional Health Knowledge and Practices (ATHKPs) continue to serve as the first line of healthcare for most of the population. However, formal nursing education has not adequately integrated ATHKPs, leading to cultural insensitivity, professional skepticism, and fragmented care. This study aimed to bridge that gap through the development of a competency-based framework to guide the systematic inclusion of ATHKPs in undergraduate nursing curricula. A three-phase, exploratory sequential mixed-methods design was adopted, underpinned by a pragmatic paradigm. Phase 1 involved qualitativo interviews with Traditional Health Practitioners (THPs) to explore their roles, practices, and perspectives on collaboration with allopathic professionals. Phase 2 consisted of a national quantitative survey of nurse educators to assess current inclusion and teaching practices of ATHKPs in nursing education. In Phase 3, findings from both phases were integrated and used to develop a competency-based framework through a consultative process involving stakeholders from traditional medicine, academia, and policy. Findings confirmed the fragmented and informal inclusion of ATHKPs in nursing curricula, with no standardized content or competencies. The developed framework outlines key domains: foundational knowledge of traditional health systems, practical collaboration skills, and cultural humility. The framework is aligned with national nursing standards and aims to support the training of nurses who are both culturally competent and prepared to work in integrative health systems. This framework offers a strategic response to global calls for integrating traditional knowledge into mainstream health professional education. It promotes culturally congruent care, strengthens collaboration between biomedical and traditional practitioners, and contributes to the broader goals of curriculum decolonization, health equity, and sustainable development.",

    "abstract": "Increasing evidence has emerged for traditional, complementary, and integrative medicine (TCIM) to treat COVID-19, which requires systematic summaries of the net benefits of intervençãos against standard care and one another. The study aims to conduct a revisão sistemática and network metanálise regarding TCIM therapies for treating mild/moderate acute COVID-19. We systematically searched EMBASE (Elsevier), Medline (OVID), VHL TCIM database, Cochrane Central, Clinical Trials.gov, ICTRP as of March 22nd, 2024, and eight additional Chinese databases and four Korean databases for RCTs comparing TCIM intervenção with another TCIM intervenção, standard of care (SoC), placebo, or conventional medicine in participants with suspected, probable, or confirmed mild/moderate acute COVID-19. Reviewers worked in pairs and independently screened titles/abstracts and full text of all potentially eligible trials, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias for each resultado. We performed frequentist network meta-analyses and rated the certainty of the evidence for each resultado using the Grading of Recomendações Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. We further grouped intervençãos from most to least effective. 155 trials evaluating 142 TCIM therapies were eligible for review, of which 69 (45%) trials enrolling 18,627 patients met the analysis criteria of contributing at least 80 participants or 20 events to one intervenção. All the following estimates come from direct evidence as networks were sparse. Compared with SoC alone, high to moderate certainty evidence showed that three TCIM add-on intervençãos reduced time to symptom resolution: Kovir capsule (-3.14 days, -3.67 to -2.61, high certainty); Lianhua Qingwen (-2.82 days, -3.14 to -2.50, high certainty); and honey and Nigella sativa (-3.00 days, -4.12 to -1.88, moderate certainty). Since 71% of eligible studies recruited participants at inpatient or isolation settings, we inferred admission to hospital resultado from the rate of conversion to severe cases. For patients at low risk of hospitalization, high to very low certainty evidence supported that there was little or no difference in admission to hospital between any TCIM intervenção and SoC. For patients at moderate risk of hospitalization, Andrographis paniculata extract probably reduced admission to the hospital (-15 per 1000, -24.9 to 12.3, moderate certainty). All comparisons for admission to hospital in patients at high risk of hospitalization, and comparisons for mortality and mechanical ventilation were supported by only low or very low certainty evidence. Moderate to high certainty evidence showed that Lianhua Qingwen, Kovir capsule, COROPROTECT kit, and Shen Cao Gan Jiang did not result in an increase in adverse events leading to drug discontinuation; other TCIM intervençãos lack enough evidence to inform adverse events leading to discontinuation. Lianhua Qingwen was also effective in resolving fatigue and cough(moderate to high certainty); honey and Nigella sativa was effective in resolving fever; and Jinghua Jiedu was effective in resolving cough. Kovir capsule, Lianhua Qingwen, and honey and Nigella sativa probably reduce the time needed to resolve symptoms of acute COVID-19; Andrographis paniculata extract probably reduces admission to hospital in patients at moderate risk of hospitalization. Independent replication of these findings is warranted. The efetividade and segurança of most TCIM intervençãos remain uncertain.",

    "abstract": "There is growing interest in the relationship between Neuroscience and Spirituality, particularly regarding the human skills of contemplation and meditação. In response, we organized a virtual course presenting scientific evidence on brain function during meditative and religious practices. The course focused on issues such as faith, beliefs, and coping mechanisms for daily life. The 90-day online course consisted of biweekly 150-minute classes. Each class was divided into a theoretical half, presenting scientific literature on Neuroscience, and a practical half, featuring a progressive meditação program. This program was designed to build anchors for the physical, vital, mental, and spiritual dimensions of human constitution. Participants (n=24) were evaluated using the WHOQOL-BREF and Spiritual Experience Index instruments before and three months after the course. Quantitative analysis showed no statistically significant differences between pre- and post-intervenção measures. The overall WHOQOL-BREF score increased slightly from a mean of 41.08 (SD=8.26) to 42.21 (SD=8.44), but the change was non-significant (t(23)=1.07, p=0.297). By domain, Physical health remained stable (Mpre=76.35, Mpost=76.50; t(23)=0.09, p=0.932), Psychological scores decreased marginally (Mpre=73.10, Mpost=72.57; t(23)=0.30, p=0.764), Social relationships showed a non-significant decline (Mpre=67.71, Mpost=63.55; t(23)=0.75, p=0.462), and Environment also showed a decrease (Mpre=70.98, Mpost=66.68; t(23)=0.98, p=0.337). Clinical indicators, such as the number of diagnoses (Mpre=0.23, Mpost=0.13; t(21)=0.90, p=0.378) and the Charlson Comorbidity Index (Mpre=0.46, Mpost=0.13; t(21)=1.22, p=0.236), also did not differ significantly. Despite the absence of statistically significant changes, qualitativo focus group analysis revealed participants reports of increased well-being, better coping with daily stress, and a deepened spiritual experience. These findings highlight the importance of mixed-methods designs for capturing the nuanced impacts of contemplative practices. The online course on Neuroscience and Spirituality effectively fostered improvements in self-perceived well-being and spiritual experience, even though standard psychometric scales did not capture statistically significant effects. This discrepancy underscores that the benefits of contemplative practices may be subtle and multidimensional, and that mixed-methods approaches are essential to fully assess their impact.",

    "abstract": "The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has affected over 771 million individuals worldwide, with 6.9 million confirmed deaths as of November 2023. Beyond the acute phase, a significant proportion of patients develop Post-Acute COVID-19 Syndrome (PACS), defined by persistent symptoms 4 weeks after infection. Risk factors include severe acute illness, ICU admission, and underlying immune-metabolic imbalances. PACS overlaps clinically and mechanistically with chronic inflammatory, autonomic, and functional disorders, suggesting underlying neuroimmune-endocrine dysregulation. This explores the potential role of neural terapia in modulating these dysfunctions. A narrative review was conducted using PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar, targeting literature published between January 2020 and March 2024. The search strategy employed the terms: \"Post-Acute COVID-19 Syndrome,\" \"Long COVID,\" \"neurogenic inflammation,\" \"autonomic dysfunction,\" \"inflammatory reflex,\" \"vagus nerve stimulation,\" \"stellate ganglion block,\" and \"neural terapia.\" Studies were included if they provided data on PACS pathophysiology, autonomic imbalance, or clinical resultados of neuromodulatory intervençãos using local anesthetics. Case reports with insufficient methodological detail or unrelated to autonomic regulation were excluded. A total of 136 articles were identified; 78 met inclusion criteria. Extracted data were synthesized into a systems-based conceptual model. Findings indicate that PACS is associated with dysregulation of the extended autonomic nervous system, characterized by persistent neurogenic inflammation, central and peripheral sensitization, and impaired function of the inflammatory reflex. These alterations reflect a maladaptive stress response triggered by sustained irritation of the nervous system. Neuraltherapeutic Medicine, which employs local anesthetics to modulate dysfunctional neural circuits, emerges as a physiologically grounded intervenção. This approach directly targets the neuroimmune circuitmodulating neurogenic inflammation that disrupts tissue function. By restoring balance in the inflammatory reflex and attenuating aberrant neural signaling, neural terapia contributes to the reestablishment of tissue homeostasis and resolution of persistent inflammatory states. Observational studies and small trials have shown symptom improvement in PACS and similar autonomic-inflammatory disorders following neural terapia intervençãos, including segmental injections and ganglionic blocks. The physiological rationale aligns with historical nervism and modern systems medicine principles. Neuraltherapeutic Medicine offers a promising, low-risk intervenção for modulating core neurophysiological dysfunctions observed in PACS. By targeting the irritability of the extended autonomic networka shared final pathway in post-viral and functional syndromesit may provide benefits beyond symptomatic relief. This systems-based perspective bridges conventional infectious disease approaches with integrative neurobiology. While preliminary data are encouraging, further controlled trials are required to establish efficacy, optimize protocols, and support clinical integration. Neuraltherapeutic effect represents an important frontier in the evolving understanding and management of long COVID and related complex syndromes.",

    "abstract": "Medical students present a high prevalence of stress, related to factors such as acadêmico overload, limited time for self-care, and early exposure to emotionally demanding situations. When persistent, this stress may impair acadêmico performance, mental health, and future professional practice. Mindfulness, defined as the self-regulation of attention with non-judgmental awareness of the present moment, has demonstrated recognized therapeutic potential. Evidence suggests that strategies such as Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR), when practiced regularly, can reduce stress, ansiedade, and depressive symptoms while promoting emotional regulation and empathy. This study evaluated the effects of an adapted MBSR protocol, specifically designed for medical students, on perceived stress and inflammatory marker modulation. A prospective, longitudinal, controlled study was conducted with 26 medical students from Faculdade de Medicina do ABC (13 in the intervenção group; 13 in the control group). The intervenção involved six weekly 1.5-hour sessions of atenção plena-based practices. Assessments were conducted before and after the intervenção. Subjective resultados included the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10), the Cognitive and Affective Mindfulness ScaleRevised (CAMS-R), and the Philadelphia Mindfulness Scale (PHLMS). Biological resultados included serum levels of cortisol, TNF-, IL-6, C-reactive protein (CRP), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). Participants who missed more than one session, failed to provide lab samples, or did not complete the questionnaires were excluded. Twelve participants completed the study (six per group), resulting in a dropout rate of 53.9%. Attrition was likely related to emotional discomfort during atenção plena practices and overlap with final exams, which may also have influenced resultados. Still, significant and literature-aligned differences were observed. In the intervenção group, perceived stress decreased by 53.35%, while it increased by 6.29% in controls. CAMS-R scores showed a progressive increase in atenção plena traits (+45.16% intervenção vs. +21.18% control). On the PHLMS, notable increases were observed in acceptance (+21.12% intervenção vs. +2.55% control) and awareness (+20% intervenção vs. 16.82% control), suggesting enhanced emotional stability and mental presence among atenção plena practitioners, even under acadêmico pressure. Regarding biological resultados, CRP levels dropped markedly in the intervenção group (53.37%) but rose in controls (+20%), indicating favorable inflammatory modulation. ESR rose slightly in the intervenção group (+3.95%) but sharply in controls (+65.09%). IL-6 increased in both groups, though less in the intervenção group (+31.88% vs. +117.32%). Interestingly, TNF- rose sharply in the intervenção group (+527.36%), possibly reflecting acute inflammatory responses to emotional release during practices. Cortisol levels decreased similarly in both groups (~6.5%). Despite the small sample size and high dropout rate, regular engagement in the protocol's activities proved to be an effective and accessible strategy for reducing perceived stress, enhancing atenção plena, and modulating inflammatory markers in medical students. Although more robust studies are needed, the findings support the inclusion of atenção plena as a complementary tool in mental promoção da saúde. Moreover, the adapted protocol shows potential for standardization and integration into university extension programs. Its implementation may contribute to the development of emotionally intelligent, resilient, and compassionate physicians, with a positive impact on patient care and professional sustainability.",

    "abstract": "Psychosocial factors such as chronic stress, depressão, ansiedade, and social isolation are increasingly recognized as significant contributors to the progression of various diseases, including cancer. These factors exert their influence through complex neuroendocrine and immuno-inflammatory pathways. While these connections are gaining traction, the precise biological mechanisms often remain under-explored in conventional healthcare. Traditional, Complementary, and Integrative Medicine (TCIM) approaches, particularly mind-body practices, offer a promising avenue to modulate these pathways, providing a biologically plausible and complementary strategy to conventional tratamentos. This mixed-method revisão sistemática synthesized evidence linking psychosocial distress to disease biology, aiming to inform TCIM-based integrative strategies for broader saúde pública application. Following Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) guidelines, a systematic search was conducted across six international databases (PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus, PsycInfo, and EBSCOhost) covering the period from 1990 to 2024. Studies involving adult patients that correlated psychosocial variables with neuroendocrine or immunological biomarkers were included. Data synthesis followed the convergent segregated approach. A total of 231 studies were identified, and 11 met methodological quality criteria (moderate or high) and were included in the final synthesis. The findings reveal that depressão is associated with dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and sympathetic nervous system (SNS), evidenced by elevated levels of stress hormones like cortisol and norepinephrine. Chronic stress and social isolation were linked to increased expression of pro-disease genes such as NF-B, CREB, YAP1, and the CTRA (Conserved Transcriptional Response to Adversity). These genes are implicated in key pathological processes including inflammation, immune suppression, and cellular dysfunction across various conditions. Immune analyses demonstrated reduced Natural Killer (NK) cell activity and elevated T-regulatory (Treg) cells, alongside sustained pro-inflammatory cytokine activity (e.g., IL-6, TNF-). These mechanisms collectively foster a disease-permissive microenvironment, impacting processes like epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) pathway activation, which are relevant not only in cancer but also in cardiovascular disease and mental health disorders. The results of this review indicate that stress management intervençãos, such as Cognitive Behavioral Stress Management (CBSM) and Relaxation Training, should be considered as adjuvants in oncological tratamento, especially in patients undergoing chemoterapia, radioterapia, or surgery. These intervençãos demonstrated a reduction in inflammatory markers such as IL-6, NF-B, and pro-tumor gene expression profiles (CTRA), in addition to contributing to the positive modulation of the HPA axis and the sympathetic nervous system (SNS). Future ensaio clínicos should investigate the efficacy of these intervençãos using molecular biomarkers to assess their biobehavioral impact and therapeutic benefit in a diverse range of saúde pública contexts. The sustained activation of the HPA axis and SNS by psychological distress facilitates critical disease processes, including immune evasion and metastasis in cancer, and contributes to the progression of other chronic conditions. These findings provide a compelling biological rationale for integrating mind-body TCIM modalitiessuch as atenção plena, yoga, meditação, acupuntura, and psychosocial supportinto standard healthcare across the spectrum from promoção da saúde to the management of challenging clinical resultados.",

    "abstract": "Chronic arterial hypertension is one of the most common causes of maternal mortality, affecting approximately 10% of pregnant women worldwide and considering the effects of meditação on the blood pressure in non-pregnant women and the studies that suggest the benefits of meditação for pregnant women, it is important to verify the effects of including meditação in managing chronic hypertension in pregnant women. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of meditação on diastolic blood pressure. We also analyzed its effect on systolic and mean blood pressures, ansiedade levels, qualidade de vida, resilience, and atenção plena in pregnant women. A blind randomized controlled ensaio clínico was conducted. A total of 47 participants were randomized into two groups: the intervenção (n = 24) and control (n = 23). Participants were instructed to meditate twice a day, for 10 min. Their blood pressure was measured in fortnightly face-to-face meetings. The instruments used were the Resilience Scale, the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale, the World Health Organization Quality of Life Scale , and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, which were administered at the enrollment and after 8 weeks of follow-up. The groups were similar in the initial analysis. The intervenção resulted in significantly reduced diastolic blood pressure (p* = 0.010, n2 = 0.17), mean blood pressure (p* = 0.034, n2 = 0.76), and ansiedade (p* = 0.036, n2 = 0.24) as well as improved qualidade de vida (p* = 0.015, n2 = 0.39). Meditation resulted in significantly reduced diastolic, mean blood pressure and ansiedade as well as improved qualidade de vida, with a large effect size corroborating meditação as a promising complementary terapia in the follow-up of hypertensive pregnant women. Study register: This study is registered at Clinicaltrials.gov (registration number NCT03873194).",

    "abstract": "In recent years, both the demand for meditação intervençãos by pregnant women and the production of research in this area have increased; however, extant literature reviews refer to the limited available data supporting the efficacy and/or efetividade of such intervençãos. This review aims to aggregate previous meditação research conducted with pregnant women and to specifically identify the difficulties and limitations encountered. The guiding question of this study was as follows: What are the difficulties and limitations of meditação research with pregnant women A structured integrative literature review was performed. A total of three electronic databases PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, and Embase and the Google Scholar indexing tool were searched without language restrictions, and studies were evaluated according to inclusion and exclusion criteria. A search strategy specifically pre-planned for each database was used. The searches focused on meditação intervençãos performed during pregnancy. The relevance of the titles and abstracts of articles obtained from the electronic searches, as well as the application of the selection criteria, were evaluated independently by two researchers for each potentially relevant title. The literature search initially identified 2571 documents. After the eligibility criteria were applied, 37 articles were included in the qualitativo synthesis. The main limitations in the study of meditação in pregnant women are related to questions regarding the choice of methods and how such methods can consider and encompass specific characteristics of the gestational period in addition to difficulties in recruitment and adherence to intervençãos. The main limitations with respect to meditação research in pregnant women are related to the choice of research methods and procedures and how they can encompass the specific characteristics of the gestational period, such as analysing the results by gestational trimester, making the inclusion criterion and intervençãos last throughout the pregnancy, and focusing the resultado measures, when possible, related to the gestational period. Clinical research on meditação in pregnant women using pragmatic methods can be a resource for understanding real-world practice. Relevant research projects should be supported by guidelines that enable the reproduction of these projects and allow joint analysis with subsequent data in large revisions.",

    "abstract": "Diabetes mellitus remains a significant global health challenge. There is growing interest in integrating traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), such as the classic formula Liuwei Dihuang Pill (LWDHP), with conventional therapies. LWDHP shows potential for managing diabetes-related symptoms and biochemical parameters. However, the synergistic effects and segurança profile of combining LWDHP with oral hypoglycemic agents (OHAs) lack comprehensive evaluation. This revisão sistemática synthesizes existing evidence on the efficacy and segurança of LWDHP-OHAs combination terapia in patients with type 2 diabetes, aiming to assess its potential for improved glycemic and lipid control. We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, CNKI, VIP, Sinomed, and Wanfang databases from inception to July 21, 2024. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing LWDHP-OHAs combination terapia against OHAs alone in adults with type 2 diabetes. Two reviewers independently screened studies, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane tool. Primary resultados were fasting blood glucose (FBG), postprandial blood glucose (PBG), and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c). Secondary resultados included insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and high-density lipoprotein (HDL). Meta-analyses used RevMan 5.4, with heterogeneity assessed via I² statistics. A total of 91 RCTs involving 9489 participants met inclusion criteria. Meta-analysis showed that compared to OHAs monoterapia, LWDHP-OHAs combination terapia significantly reduced glycemic and lipid parameters: FBG (MD=-1.40, 95%CI [-1.60, -1.21], 89 RCTs, very low-certainty evidence), PBG (MD=-1.65, 95%CI [-1.88, -1.41], 81 RCTs, very low- certainty evidence), HbA1c (MD=-0.94, 95%CI [-1.14, -0.73], 38 RCTs, very low- certainty evidence), HOMA-IR (MD=-1.04, 95%CI [-1.26, -0.82], 13 RCTs, very low- certainty evidence), TG (MD=-0.34, 95%CI [-0.40, -0.27], 27 RCTs, very low- certainty evidence), TC (MD=-0.56, 95%CI [-0.70, -0.42], 27 RCTs, very low- certainty evidence), and LDL (MD=-0.42, 95%CI [-0.57, -0.27], 22 RCTs, very low- certainty evidence). The combination also increased HDL (MD = 0.22 mmol/L, 95% CI [0.16, 0.27]; 21 RCTs). The certainty of evidence for all resultados was assessed as very low. Five RCTs reported no significant difference in decreased appetite (RR = 0.45, 95% CI [0.16, 1.24]) or dyspepsia (RR = 1.08, 95% CI [0.26, 4.47]) between groups. Meta-analysis suggests LWDHP-OHAs combination terapia may offer short-term benefits over OHAs alone for improving glycemic level, insulin resistance, and lipid profiles in type 2 diabetes. However, the evidence certainty is very low due to methodological limitations and heterogeneity in included studies. Limited reporting found no evidence of significantly increased short-term gastrointestinal adverse events. Rigorous, multicenter, long-term RCTs with standardized protocols, adequate blinding, comprehensive adverse event monitoring, and biomarker validation are imperative to confirm potential benefits and establish clinical applicability. Future research should explore pharmacodynamic interactions and patient stratification based on TCM syndrome differentiation.",

    "abstract": "WHO has recently issued new definitions of traditional medicine, complementary medicine and integrative medicine (TCIM). Beyond official definitions, we were interested in identifying which terms for TCIM are best known in Germany and which term should perceptively be the most useful in public and political dialogues on TCIM in Germany. This study is based on a cross-sectional survey of an online-representative sample of the German-speaking residential population aged 1875 years, using a comprehensive questionnaire on TCIM use and attitudes. Descriptive analyses were carried out and decision trees calculated, using Exhausted Chi-squared Automatic Interaction Detection (CHAID) to identify key predictor variables associated with high perceived efficacy of TCIM. 4,065 participants responded to the questionnaire. The term Naturheilkunde (NHK; literal translation from German: knowledge of natural healing) was known by 55.3%; alternative medicine 43.8%; complementary medicine 19.2%; integrative medicine 15.6%. The highest percentage of positive attitude was found for conventional medicine (63.1%), followed by NHK (52.0%), integrative medicine (41.1%), complementary medicine (35.0%) and alternative medicine (25.1%). The CHAID algorithm identified variables that predict with statistical significance (p<0.001) who experiences a positive effect of TCIM. The key variables were: a positive attitude towards NHK; considering personal positive TCIM-experiences to be important; and a positive attitude towards integrative medicine. Attitude to complementary medicine or alternative medicine were not relevant as variables in this model. The German term Naturheilkunde which originates from the late 19th century popular movement on natural healing in Germany seems to be the most promising term for future public discourse on TCIM in Germany, due to its familiarity, positive connotations, and strong associations with self-perceived TCIM-benefits. While the term integrative medicine remains relatively unfamiliar in the German public, it also holds potential due to its association with self-perceived benefit, including among those with a less favorable view of Naturheilkunde. We suggest a Delphi process to define TCIM-terminology for the specific German context.",

    "abstract": "Diarrheal diseases remain a major health threat for children under five. There is currently a lack of targeted tratamento measures, with only symptomatic tratamento available. Andrographolide sulfonate, a compound found in the traditional Chinese medicine Andrographis paniculata, has been developed into an injectable formulation known as Xiyanping Injection (XYP), which is widely used in pediatric diseases, especially in infectious diseases. Given its extensive application and the urgent need for effective intervençãos, XYP may offer a potential tratamento for viral diarrhea. This review aims to pool the available evidence on the efetividade of XYP in treating viral diarrhea in children under five years old. The present revisão sistemática was carried out in line with guidelines of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA).Relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that conventional terapia plus XYP for treating viral diarrhea in children under 5 years old was retrieved from PubMed, EMbase, The Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang, VIP, Sniomed, and the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry System. The search period was from the inception of the databases to May 1, 2025. The methodological quality of the included studies was assessed using the Risk of Bias Assessment Tool. Meta-analysis was performed using R 2.4.4 software for studies with low heterogeneityI²75%, and the evidence was graded according to the \"Recomendações for Grading Clinical Evidence Based on Evidence Matrix in Traditional Chinese Medicine.\" A total of 24 RCTs involving 2869 patients were included. All included studies had a high risk of bias due to improper randomization methods and the lack of blinding. Meta-analysis results showed that conventional terapia plus XYP group had a higher cure rate [RR=1.70, 95%CI (1.29, 2.24), I²=53%] and effective rate [RR=1.23, 95%CI (1.09, 1.40), I²=31.9%] compared to conventional terapia alone. Compared to conventional terapia plus antiviral drugs, it also had a higher effective rate [RR=1.38, 95%CI (1.22, 1.56), I²=33.5%] and effective rate [RR=1.16, 95%CI (1.10, 1.21), I²=60.6%]. There was no difference in the incidence of adverse reactions between the two groups [RR=0.44, 95%CI (0.19, 1.03), I²=28.9%]. A few adverse reactions were all mild rashes. The conventional terapia plus XYP group had a shorter duration of diarrhea (9 studies with conventional terapia alone and 12 with conventional terapia plus antiviral drugs as controls) and hospital stay(2 studies with conventional terapia alone and 4 with conventional terapia plus antiviral drugs as controls), but due to high heterogeneity, metanálise was not performed. None of the studies reported on stool consistency and frequency. The combined traditional Chinese medicine clinical evidence level was rated as Level III (Moderate). Andrographolide Sulfonates (XYP injection) appears to have certain advantages over conventional terapia alone or conventional terapia plus antiviral drugs in improving the cure rate and effective rate of viral diarrhea in children, and it can be used safely. However, the quality of the included studies is low, and more high-quality evidence is needed to draw a definitive conclusion.",

    "abstract": "Infertility is a growing saúde pública issue that affects millions of people worldwide and is associated with physical, emotional, and social impactsespecially for women undergoing Assisted Reproduction (AR), who often face high levels of stress and ansiedade. Although the Brazilian Unified Health System (SUS) offers specialized, high-quality tratamentos, these can still cause multidimensional distress, negatively influencing qualidade de vida and pregnancy success rates. In this context, integrative therapies such as Reiki - recognized by the World Health Organization and incorporated into SUS - have gained attention for promoting better coping mechanisms, adaptation to stressful situations, and reduction of multidimensional symptoms. Studies suggest that Reiki can be effective in reducing ansiedade and stress in various health contexts, but scientific evidence regarding its use in AR remains limited. This study aimed to investigate the effects of Reiki on ansiedade, stress, and pregnancy success rates in infertile women undergoing AR through a randomized, controlled, and blinded ensaio clínico. PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of Reiki on stress and ansiedade in infertile women during the AR cycle. SECONDARY OBJECTIVE: To assess the pregnancy rate in women undergoing Reiki during AR. A randomized, controlled, blinded, and experimental ensaio clínico was conducted with the research question: Does Reiki have any impact/effect on stress, ansiedade, and pregnancy rates in infertile women undergoing AR A total of 40 women aged 29 to 42 participated, most of whom were self-employed, married, white, had completed higher education, had a family income above three minimum wages, were Catholic, and had a diagnosis of infertility treated at the Human Reproduction Center of a public hospital. Participants were randomly assigned to three groups: Reiki (G1), Placebo (G2), and Control (G3). Data collection and randomization occurred between 2021 and 2023 using the RedCap virtual data manager. Psychometric scales validated in Brazil were applied across all groups to assess stress (Fertility Problem Inventory - FPI), ansiedade (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale - HAD-A), and a questionnaire including sociodemographic, clinical, and integrative/Reiki knowledge data. These were administered at the beginning (Time 1 - T1) and end of tratamento (Time 2 - T2) for all groups. The Reiki intervenção and placebo were applied in groups G1 and G2, respectively, at three stages of tratamento: ovarian stimulation, embryo transfer, and mid-luteal phase. Data analysis was conducted using IBM® SPSS® Statistics version 25 and R i386 v.3.4.0, applying both analytical and descriptive statistics. All ethical standards were upheld. Reiki and placebo groups showed significant ansiedade reduction; stress changes were not statistically significant but clinically relevant. Pregnancy rates were higher in the Reiki group, suggesting emotional and physiological benefits during assisted reproduction. Reiki proved to be an effective terapia for reducing ansiedade in women undergoing AR and likely contributed to pregnancy success rates. There was clinically significant evidence of Reikis positive impact on stress reduction in the AR context. Future studies with larger samples and improved methodological design should be encouraged, as Reiki has shown promise and positively impacted infertility tratamento resultados for women undergoing AR.",

It commonly affected the young adult population (ranging from 31 to 40 years), and the common anatomical site involved was the low back (54.1%) (Kumar et al., 2019). With current socio-economic transformation, more workers are committed to desk jobs. Prolonged sitting & repetitive, continuous, unnatural movements result in undue tension on muscles, ligaments, and joints in the shoulder and neck. The objective of the study was to evaluate the efetividade of integrated yoga on musculoskeletal pain, flexibility, stress, & qualidade de vida of desk job workers in a tertiary hospital. A sample of 66 desk job workers with ages between 18 and 55 years, working in a tertiary care hospital, including both male and female, was included in the study. Musculoskeletal pain, lower back and hamstring flexibility, perceived stress, and qualidade de vida were measured using the Cornell Musculoskeletal Discomfort Questionnaire, the Wells & Dillon sit and stretch test, the perceived stress scale, and the WHOQOL-BREF, respectively, pre- and post-intervenção. 64 participants completed the study; the intervenção group showed significant improvement (p<0.5) in subjective musculoskeletal pain, lower back and hamstring flexibility, and stress & QOL domains as compared to baseline after 6 weeks of intervenção. The standard group showed no improvement in any of the measures. In post-assessment analysis, there was a significant difference between the groups. The present study reports that 6 weeks of integrated yoga has resulted in improvement of musculoskeletal pain, hip and lower back flexibility, stress reduction, and increased qualidade de vida. Various research has proved this mind-body intervenção as most effective among complementary and alternative modalities in treating musculoskeletal disorders, alleviating psychological problems, and uplifting the qualidade de vida. The work profile of desk job workers is demanding on their physical and mental health. The scenario is worse for those who work in a tertiary care hospital with OPD footfall of around 10,000 per day. Darivemula et al found a high one-year prevalence of WRNP (work-related neck pain) among desk job workers in a tertiary care hospital (Darivemula et al., 2016). This population serve masses at large scale in central and peripheral areas like admission, discharge, billing, registration, labs, accounts, administration, etc. Since there has been reliance upon pharmacological measures with the consumption of NSAIDs, opioids, etc for relieving MSP (musculoskeletal pain), it rather puts the users at stake with their high side effects and abuse leading to further addition of problems. Moreover, its not a permanent solution. The results of present study clearly demonstrated a decrease in musculoskeletal pain, an increase in flexibility, managed stress, and an enhanced qualidade de vida. Yoga, combining loosening practices, specific postures, pranayama, relaxation, and prayer, effectively helps desk job workers manage musculoskeletal pain and improve well-being.",

    "abstract": "This article investigates the epistemological rift between divergent medical rationalities by comparing Circadian Medicine (CM) and yurveda. CM, rooted in chronobiology, operates through mechanistic assumptions grounded in Cartesian-Newtonian science. yurveda, by contrast, is founded on an organicist paradigm that understands physiology as embedded within ecological and cosmic rhythms. The objective is to examine how these paradigms differ in their conceptions of biological rhythms, causality, and knowledgearguing that epistemological pluralism is essential for developing a coherent and truly integrative medical methodology. This is a theoretical and comparative epistemological analysis grounded in the historical development of medical systems. The study draws on historical and conceptual literature on chronobiology and the emergence of Circadian Medicine (CM), contrasting it with foundational principles of ayurvedic thoughtparticularly the doctrines of 'resemblance' and 'particularity' (i.e., lokapuruasmya and samnyaviea). Broader discussions in the philosophy of science were also incorporated, with special attention to how unexamined reductionist methodologies in CM often rely on experimental models that disregard subjective, ecological, and temporal dimensions crucial to health. In contrast, yurvedas principles support a worldview in which physiological, environmental, and cosmic processes reflect one anotherallowing biological rhythms to be understood within a paradigm inherently oriented toward complexity and relationality. The comparative analysis reveals that Circadian Medicine, while contributing significantly to biomedical understandings of biological rhythmsparticularly in sleep and sports medicineremains epistemologically constrained by a medical rationality that isolates variables and mechanizes physiological processes. Its methodologies often rely on extrapolations from animal models with limited applicability to human chronotypes, and tend to overlook both the environmental determinants of physiology and the subjective dimensions of psychological states. yurveda, by contrast, articulates health through an integrated cosmological and ecological rationality, wherein time, environment, and consciousness are inseparable from physiological processes. This epistemological clashbetween a paradigm grounded in control through fragmentation and one rooted in coherence through interdependencedemonstrates that meaningful integration requires first acknowledging the incommensurability of their respective foundations. Without such recognition, efforts to build integrative models risk internal contradiction and epistemic incoherence. While Circadian Medicine advances temporal awareness in healthcare, its underlying mechanistic rationality constrains the integration of behavioral, environmental, and spiritual dimensions. yurveda, as an organicist system, offers a coherent alternative paradigm for addressing the complexity of biological rhythms through a wide spectrum of metabolic cyclessuch as digestion, circadian patterns, menstrual flow, seasonal transitions, and stages of life (i.e., bhukta, ahortra, rtava, tu, vayas). The epistemological abyss between mechanistic and organicist paradigms lies in their radically different conceptions of knowledge and causality. Mechanistic approaches, dominant in biomedicine, reduce phenomena into discrete parts to explain function through linear, cause-effect relationships. In contrast, organicist paradigmssuch as those backgrounding yurvedaconceive systems as relational, dynamic, and context-sensitive. These are not just divergent methods, but incompatible worldviews: one seeks control through fragmentation; the other, coherence through interdependence. Thus, Integrative Medicine can go beyond methodological pluralism. It requires epistemological pluralismacknowledging multiple medical rationalities as essential for navigating complexity in health and healing. Bridging this gap is foundational for contextually meaningful and scientifically coherent integrative models.",

    "abstract": "Primary Health Care is the gateway for users to health services and the main liaison with other services in the network. This level of care can be understood as one of the organizational pillars of patient and family care. Integrative health practices (IHPs) are complementary care services that use techniques to improve care. This study is justified by the need to explore and expand discussions on the inclusion of public policies involving the relationship between IHPs and PHC, and how this implementation contributes to the full implementation of PHC attributes and access to other therapies involved in the population's care. This study aims to discuss the aspects involved in the inclusion of IHPs in Primary Health Care Units (PHUs) located in Program Area (PA) 3.2 of the city of Rio de Janeiro, RJ. This descriptive and exploratory study, with a qualitativo approach, collected data and identified the phenomena that reflect this concept through descriptive research. The study was conducted in 19 Primary Health Care Units in AP 3.2. The participants were health service managers who manage these units. The interviews followed a semi-structured script. The responses were transcribed verbatim and analyzed using thematic analysis. The study was submitted to the Research Ethics Committee for review and received approval number 6,686,310. The PICS offered in AP 3.2 and the factors that contribute to and hinder their provision were identified. Thus, based on the data collected, seven categories were constructed, addressing: 1 - characterization of the interviewees, 2 - PICS offered in the UAP of AP 3.2, 3 - factors that contribute to the implementation of PICS in the UAP of AP 3.2, 4 - Factors that hinder the implementation of PICS in the UAP of AP 3.2, 5 - Opportunities in the insertion of PICS in the UAP of AP 3.2, 6 - Threats in the insertion of PICS in the UAP of AP 3.2, 7 - Internal and external factors that influence the insertion of PICS in AP 3.2. The technical-technological product - PTT, was built through an action plan where concrete actions were proposed to stimulate the training and increase the supply of PICS in the UAP of AP 3.2. We conclude that, in accordance with the objectives proposed in this study, it was possible to identify the inclusion of 12 integrative and complementary practices in the primary healthcare units of AP 3.2, where auriculoterapia is predominant in 80% of the units analyzed. Based on the evidence demonstrating weaknesses and threats in the inclusion of these practices, an action plan was developed to contribute to the units and the work routine of professionals, aiming at the inclusion and expansion of the offer of these practices within the scope of Primary Health Care.",

    "abstract": "Anxiety disorders affect up to one-third of children worldwide, and access to pharmacological or cognitive-behavioral care remains uneven. Traditional mind-body practicesyoga, atenção plena, tai chi, qigong and breath-regulation techniquesare promoted as complementary options, yet their evidence base has not been comprehensively mapped in the past decade. This scoping review charts global research on mind-body intervençãos for paediatric ansiedade published between 2005 and 2025. Following PRISMA-ScR, eight bibliographic databases and four grey-literature sources were searched (January 2005  June 2025). Search strings combined pediatric terms, ansiedade and specific mind-body modalities. Records were de-duplicated in Zotero; one reviewer screened titles/abstracts (n = 1 931) and full texts (n = 210), with 20 % blinded re-screening ( = 0.88). Inclusion criteria: participants 18 years; ansiedade as primary or secondary resultado; intervenção centered on a codified or non-codified mind-body practice. Study characteristics were charted. No ethics approval was required because only publicly available studies were used. One hundred thirty-four studies from 28 countries met inclusion (total n 10 400). Designs: randomized controlled trials 43 %, quasi-experimental 28 %, qualitativo 16 %, mixed-methods 13 %. Modalities: yoga 61 %, atenção plena/MBSR 24 %, tai chi/qigong 10 %, breathwork/other 5 %. Median sample size = 44 (IQR 2868); follow-up < 12 weeks in 72 % of trials. Sixteen validated ansiedade scales were used, dominated by SCARED and STAIC. Seventy-nine per cent of quantitative studies reported statistically significant ansiedade reductions versus control/usual care, but effect sizes were typically small-to-moderate and risk-of-bias high due to limited blinding and short duration. Geographic gaps persist in sub-Saharan Africa and the Middle East, and age coverage is thin for 911-year-olds. Existing revisão sistemáticas echo these methodological concerns. Yoga, atenção plena and related mind-body practices show promise for reducing pediatric ansiedade, yet heterogeneity and design limitations temper confidence. Future research should prioritize under-studied modalities, standardize resultado measures, recruit more diverse populations and extend follow-up to assess durability. These findings inform clinicians and policy-makers considering integration of mind-body programs into child and adolescent mental-health services worldwide.",

    "abstract": "Many publicly funded primary-care systems now trial acupuntura to widen options for pain and mental-health management and curb opioid use. Evidence on how these services are organised, financed and staffed, however, is scattered across policy papers, technical reports and small-scale evaluations. This narrative review brings together open-access literature published between 2000 and 2025 to describe existing models for integrating acupuntura into public atenção primária and to summarize their reported resultados. From 21 June to 8 July 2025, PubMed/MEDLINE, PubMed Central, WHO-IRIS, the first 300 Google Scholar hits and the official health-ministry websites of Brazil, the United Kingdom, China, Australia and the United States were searched with terms combining acupuntura, atenção primária, community health and public or government. After de-duplication, 786 records were screened by title and abstract; 92 full texts were read, and 27 documents from 12 countries met the inclusion criteria. For each source, we extracted country, health-system characteristics, integration model, funding mechanism, workforce profile, target conditions and any clinical, economic or patient-experience resultados. Because all material was in the public domain, ethical approval was unnecessary. Four recurrent patterns of service delivery emerged. In-house clinics run by medically trained staff appear in frontier community health centres in the United States, where family physicians certified in acupuntura treat dor crônica and insomnia. On-site complementary-terapia units staffed by licensed acupuncturists are common in Brazils Unified Health System, which often combines acupuntura with phytoterapia and tai-chi classes. A third approach relies on formal referral pathways to community acupuncturists reimbursed by public insurance, as in the United Kingdoms Beating Back Pain programs. Finally, several South-East London pilots offer group or community acupuntura sessions in primary-care buildings after hours, allowing up to ten patients to receive low-cost tratamento simultaneously. Across these models, funding mixes vary: about half rely on direct public reimbursement, one-third on blended capitation plus fee-for-service, and the remainder on short-term grants or nominal patient co-payments. Evaluationsalthough generally small and methodologically limitedconsistently report moderate pain reduction, high satisfação do paciente and, in two economic studies, modest cost savings relative to usual care. No eligible studies came from sub-Saharan Africa or the Middle East. Despite differing health-system contexts, nations tend to adopt one of four basic models when embedding acupuntura in public atenção primária, and early results suggest the approach is feasible, acceptable and clinically useful. Stronger cost-efetividade analyses, standardized resultado measures and studies in underserved regions are needed to guide sustained, equitable scale-up.",

However, these studies remain fragmented, lacking systematic synthesis. This bibliometric analysis maps global acupuntura relato de casos/series over 20 years to identify trends, knowledge gaps, and thematic evolution. Publications were retrieved from databases including Web of Science (20002025). CiteSpace and Excel were used to analyze contributions by countries, institutions, authors, journals, citations, keywords and topics. Among 508 articles analyzed, publication output exhibited stable growth patterns, with China (252 papers, 49.6%) identified as the most prolific country, following by South Korea (62 papers,12.2%) and USA (54 papers,10.6%). Key institutions such as Beijing University of Chinese Medicine acted as an highest influential node, and influential authors is Hu Hantong, with ten articles, though inter-institutional partnerships were limited. High-impact journals included Acupuncture in Medicine, Medicine, and Explore-The Journal of Science and Healing. The first bibliometric study, by Millea, PJ, was published in 2005 titled Acupuncture tratamento of compression neuropathy of the radial nerve: A single relato de caso of \"Saturday Night Palsy\". In type of study distribution, Single relato de caso constituted the majority of publications (372/508, 73.2%), followed by case series/reports (95/508, 18.7%) and combined relato de casos with literature reviews (33/508, 6.5%). Besides traditional acupuntura, dry needling (45 papers) and electroacupuntura (63 papers) fire needle (45 papers) were prominent. Keyword analysis revealed evolving research foci, including fire needle, dry needling, acupuntura analgesia. Acupuncture relato de casos/series have expanded significantly, with current hotspots emphasizing acupuntura analgesia and gaps in fire needle and dry needling. This study underscores the need for standardized reporting, strengthened interdisciplinary collaboration, and prioritization of understudied conditions.

    "abstract": "Improving the healthcare system of the Cameroonian population remains a social development objective. One of the challenges is to reduce morbidity and mortality due to the various diseases affecting the populations. This involves, among other things, the transformation of available local resources into improved traditional medicines (ITMs). The aim of this study was to assess the potential of pharmaceutical products and innovations that have been developed against common pathologies. A semi-structured survey of Cameroon's territory was carried out with 15 laboratories, research structures and universities, 12 associations representing some 240 Traditional Healers (TH), and the health authorities in charge of drug regulation. The results showed that 90% of the resources used to manufacture phytodrugs came from plants. Nearly 800 medicinal plants (MP) were identified and indicated for the tratamento of 49 pathologies. The diseases most in demand were malaria; typhoid fever; hemorrhoids; and skin, urinary and genital infections. Only 160 of these MP were subjected to chemical and/or biological studies. 840 phytodrugs, with15.71% and 84.29%, were produced by research institutes and THs, respectively. Marketing authorization (MA) was issued for 1.92% of phytodrugs, all belonging to category 2. Most of the phytodrugs (88.3%) which obtained marketing authorization were developed by research organizations. The majority of THs (84.6%) guarantee the segurança of their products through long-term use based on traditional knowledge. Safety in the use of medicines in the traditional system is not yet guaranteed, which poses a problem for the integration of traditional medicine into the healthcare system in Cameroon. The challenge is to provide evidence of segurança and efficacy, and to standardize products.",

    "abstract": "Remote work, increased by the COVID-19 pandemic, exacerbated physical and emotional health challenges, including stress, sedentary behavior, and poor mental well-being. Integrative Health Coaching (IHC) is a person-centered, evidence-informed approach, structured to support behavior change, and aligned with the principles of Traditional, Complementary and Integrative Medicine (TCIM). Applying active listening, mindful presence and motivational interviewing, IHC supports sustainable lifestyle changes by motivating people for self-care and responsibility over their health  physical, mental, emotional, social and spiritual. This pilot study evaluated the impact of a remote IHC program implemented on a small Brazilian company during the pandemic, aiming to promote sustainable healthy habits among employees. A health and wellness coaching program was offered to employees of a Brazilian health tech startup as part of a broader wellbeing initiative. On a pre-screening all employees expressed interest in implementing habit changes for a healthier life, predominantly in stress management and physical activity. With an adhesion rate of 68%, 15 participants completed 8 individual, remote health coaching sessions (50min each) offered bi-weekly. Participants unable to complete the program or without necessary mental health specialized tratamento (self-reported) were not included in the study. The health coaching process encompassed: construction of a personal health and well-being vision; guided self-assessment for seven health domains (nutrition, physical activity, sleep, resilience, relationships, environment, and spirituality); client-driven goal setting and action planning. Mental well-being was assessed pre- and post-intervenção using validated instruments: WHO-5, SRQ-20, PHQ-9, and GAD-7. Participants reported on implemented lifestyle changes along the process (documented in coaching records). Group follow-up sessions were conducted two months after program completion, to discuss lessons learned and support sustainability of implemented health habits. Qualitative feedback was collected through open-ended testimonials (not mandatory). All participants adopted at least one new health behavior; 60% implemented two or more. Satisfaction and confidence towards change improved across all seven health domains (self-reported). Mental distress (SRQ-20) dropped from 43% to 17%; risk of depressão (WHO-5) dropped from 37.5% to 7.7%. PHQ-9 scores improved, with \"no depressão\" rising from 20% to 69%, and decreases in mild (60% to 23%) and moderate symptoms (13% to 8%). GAD-7 scores showed reduced ansiedade: \"no ansiedade\" increased from 20% to 53.8%, with declines in mild (53% to 31%) and moderate levels (27% to 15%). There were no severe cases of depressão or ansiedade. Post intervenção, participants reported higher confidence in sustaining changes, particularly in physical activity and stress management/resilience. Testimonials reflected greater self-awareness, empowerment, and perceived self-efficacy. This pilot program evaluation supports the value of IHC as a TCIM-aligned strategy to promote lifestyle change, mental well-being, and self-efficacy in workplace settings. Even with remote delivery IHC was correlated with positive resultados, both quantitative and qualitativo, across psychological and behavioral domains. These findings reinforce the relevance of health coaching in workplace and its potential contribution to global promoção da saúde, in agreement with the literature. Larger, controlled studies are recommended to further assess its efetividade and scalability.",

Yet, there is no systematic overview of the literature covering all fields of homeopathic basic research using a consistent methodical approach. Although, some fields of basic research were already analyzed by systematic literature reviews with a comparable detailed method including reviews on plant-based test systems and physical experiments. A series of four systematic literature reviews with comparable methodology in basic homeopathic research is planned. The research fields comprise: cell culture experiments, chemical assays, animal research in laboratory settings and homeopatia in agriculture. The reviews will be performed according to current guidelines and take account of the PRISMA and AMSTAR checklists, with quality analysis of the publications in form of a Manuscript information Score (MIS) and data extraction for the different assays and their results. A complete systematic overview of the research field is being undertaken, with the review on homeopatia in agriculture already underway. Using a consistent methodology for each research field will enable easier comparison of the results between fields and help in the identification of synergies and in synthesising the evidence overall.",

Results demonstrate improvement in primary resultado of parent-child interaction (APCI; mutual attunement, nonverbal communication, emotional parental response), secondary resultados in qualidade de vida (KINDL), psychopathology (SCL-9k), systemic functioning (EXIS), psychosocial burden (BAS), resources (WIRF) and goal attainment (GAS). In some cases, self- and external perception showed significant differences. Third resultados present feasibility of recruitment, implementation of research methodology and data collection. The involvement of family members in the music terapia process appears to be both feasible and beneficial.

    "abstract": "Unani medicine is a well-established system of healing that traces its origins to Greco-Arabic traditions. It is primarily based on the foundational teachings of the ancient Greek physician Hippocrates (Buqrat, 460377 BC) and the Roman physician Galen (Jalinoos). Over time, this medical framework was significantly enriched by the contributions of renowned Arab and Persian scholars such as Rhazes (Al-Razi), Avicenna (Ibn Sina), Al-Zahrawi, and Ibn Nafis, who expanded its theoretical and practical dimensions into a holistic approach to healthcare. Urinalysis, also known as uroscopy, has served as a diagnostic method employed by Unani physicians since ancient times and continues to be utilized in modern medical practice. Urine (Bawl) is considered as the by product of hepatic and vascular digestion processes (Hadm Kabidi wa Uruqi) in Unani medicine. Classical Unani texts detail the evaluation of urines color, clarity, odor, consistency, and sediment to assess the state of the bodys four humors and organ function. Despite its historical relevance, these methods remain largely qualitativo and subjective in contemporary practice. So it was aimed to explore the diagnostic role of urine examination in Unani medicine and assess how artificial intelligence (AI) can enhance its precision and standardization. This review synthesizes classical Unani literature and recent advancements in AI technologies, focusing on image analysis and machine learning applications in urinalysis. Traditional Unani urinalysis offers rich diagnostic insight but remains subjective and qualitativo. AI can objectively analyze urine characteristics, detect patterns, and align findings with Unani diagnostic categories. By merging ancient wisdom with modern innovation, this integrative approach holds promise for developing accessible, cost-effective, and culturally rooted diagnostic tools. It not only supports the digital preservation of Unani knowledge but also opens new avenues for interdisciplinary research in predictive and personalized medicine.",

    "abstract": "Chronic Musculoskeletal Pain is a prevalent condition, significantly impacting saúde pública and contributing to years lived with disability. In Portugal, chronic musculoskeletal Pain affects approximately 36.7% of the population. Traditional, Complementary, and Integrative Medicine stands as a holistic strategy for the problem of Chronic Musculoskeletal Pain; it is used by up to 70% of the population in developed countries, with half of these cases being for Chronic Musculoskeletal Pain. Our study is the first to examine the impact of Traditional, Complementary, and Integrative Medicine on conventional healthcare services for managing Chronic Musculoskeletal Pain in Portugal. This cross-sectional study utilised data from 674 participants in the EPIPorto cohort, a sample of adults residing in Porto, Portugal. Data collection from 2013-2015 included demographic, socioeconomic, and health-related information, as well as responses to validated questionnaires assessing pain management, psychological well-being, and health behaviours. The primary resultado was the utilisation of conventional healthcare services. Statistical analyses included chi-square tests and Mann-Whitney U tests to explore associations between Traditional, Complementary, and Integrative Medicine use and Health Care Utilisation. Among the participants, 11.6% reported using Traditional, Complementary, and Integrative Medicine for managing chronic musculoskeletal pain in the past year. Traditional, Complementary, and Integrative Medicine users were more likely to engage in health-promoting behaviours, such as regular physical activity and higher vegetable consumption, compared to non-users. There were no associations between Traditional, Complementary, and Integrative Medicine and overall conventional healthcare utilization (non-TCIM: 80,6%; TCIM: 87%; p-value: 0,214), self-initiated tratamentos (non-TCIM: 59,3%; TCIM: 63,6%; p-value: 0,592) and self-valuated resultados, 1-much better/5-much worst, [non-TCIM: median 3 (IQR: 2 - 5) TCIM: median 4 (IQR: 2 - 5) p-value: 0,122], nevertheless there were significant differences in the number of visits to conventional services [non-TCIM: median 4 (IQR: 2 - 16,75) TCIM: median 10 (IQR: 2,5 - 32) p-value: 0,029] and expenditure, in euros, between the two groups [non-TCIM: median 18 (IQR: 0 - 75) TCIM: median 77,5 (IQR: 6,5 - 365) p-value: 0,003]. In this case, Traditional, Complementary, and Integrative Medicine tratamentos, from the perspective of conventional medicine practitioners, could play a valuable role in supporting drop-out patients: 1. Providing additional therapeutic options for patients with complex, tratamento-resistant conditions; 2. Enhancing tratamento adherence among patients with alternative lifestyles, 3. and maintaining engagement with patients at risk of disengaging. While Traditional, Complementary, and Integrative Medicine users tend to adopt healthier practices, their utilisation, initiative, frequency, and expenditures related to conventional healthcare services also increase when compared to non-users. Mental health scores, polypharmacy, sociodemographic factors, and health-related lifestyle appear to be significantly associated with Traditional, Complementary, and Integrative Medicine use. These findings suggest that Traditional, Complementary, and Integrative Medicine is used in complement rather than as a substitute for conventional care in Chronic Musculoskeletal Pain management and could play a valuable role in supporting drop-out patients.",

To this end, before and after FC, the Coping Method Scale (EMEP) and the WHOQOL-bref Quality of Life Instrument were applied to assess the patient's perception of the impacts that IBD has on their qualidade de vida, as well as whether their perception of the processes of adaptation and coping with physical and emotional aspects showed any improvement after the FC experience. The objective of this research was to carry out an intervenção with Family Constellation terapia, in order to see if there are improvements in the perception of the qualidade de vida of IBD (Inflammatory Bowel Disease) patients after tratamento. This is a qualitativo, exploratory study, approved by the Ethics Committee of the USCS (5.638.053), in which the family constellation was applied to five IBD patients who answered the questionnaires of the Mode of coping with problems (EMEP) and the WHOQOL-bref Quality of Life Instrument, days before and twenty days after the terapia. The study presented, through the analysis of results, in addition to an increase in scores for qualidade de vida, reports of perception of improvement in several aspects in the ways of coping with living with the disease and tratamento. Expectations regarding Family Constellation were met, even without prior knowledge of the therapeutic technique. Participants were able to refocus on their history and their illness, adopting new habits and a new perspective on life. This corroborates the improved overall qualidade de vida, as demonstrated by the results of the WHOQOL-bref, and the way they cope with the EMEP and the reports provided in the questionnaires. IBD is the chronic occurrence of episodes of serious inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract, which results in reduced qualidade de vida and emergence of the several difficulties related to psychological and social aspects. We observed that the possibility of applying the terapia as a complement to the IBDs tratamento can be a support that deserves further studies, with larger samples of participants.",

    "abstract": "Non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) accounts for 85% of all lung cancers and remains the leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Unfortunately, the efficacy of standard chemotherapies, such as cisplatin and doxorubicin, is severely limited by acquired resistance and metastasis, particularly in tumors driven by KRAS (~28%) or EGFR (~15%) mutations. Consequently, there is an urgent need for innovative therapeutic strategies. Plant-derived compounds still represent a promising source for novel anticancer agents. Diosgenin, a steroidal sapogenin with established bioactivity, has demonstrated antitumor properties across various cancer types. Here, we investigated the potential of diosgenin to enhance the efficacy of cisplatin and doxorubicin in KRAS-mutant (A549) and EGFR-mutant (H1975) NSCLC cell lines. A549 and H1975 cells were treated for 24 hours with diosgenin, cisplatin, and doxorubicin as single agents and in dual-drug combinations (diosgenin with cisplatin or doxorubicin). Cell viability was assessed via MTS assay, and the half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC) were determined using non-linear regression analysis. The nature of the drug interactions (synergism, additivity, antagonism) was determined using the Synergy Finder 4.0 platform. As a single agent, diosgenin induced dose-dependent cytotoxicity in both A549 and H1975 cell lines, with IC values in the micromolar range. Importantly, combinations of diosgenin with either cisplatin or doxorubicin exhibited significant synergistic and additive effects across both cell lines, indicating enhanced cell killing compared to single-agent tratamentos. This study provides compelling in vitro evidence that diosgenin can potentiate the cytotoxic efficacy of conventional chemotherapies in NSCLC cells, regardless of their KRAS or EGFR mutational status. These findings support the further preclinical investigation of diosgenin as an adjuvant therapeutic to enhance conventional oncologic regimens.",

    "abstract": "Research on meditative practices and stress reduction has intensified in recent years. Stress can be caused by various everyday situations and pathophysiological conditions in the general population, but also by specific situations, such as the postpartum period. Studies indicate that meditação can contribute to stress reduction, promoting greater maternal self-efficacy in infant care, reducing maternal psychological distress, and increasing milk production. The objective of this study was to develop an interactive website to manage meditação audio files, collect information on user access, and provide other support resources to support the ensaio clínico on meditação during breastfeeding, to be conducted with mothers of premature newborns who attend the Human Milk Bank. The interactive website, called meditAMAmente, whose domain is meditamamente.com, was developed in conjunction with the Experimental Software Engineering Agency of the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio Grande do Sul (PUCRS) from August to November 2024. To develop the meditação audios, the researcher underwent training at the PUCRS School of Meditation from 2023 to 2024. The methodology used was \"Slow Meditation,\" designed by Malone Rodrigues, which aims to focus attention based on stimuli identified by the sensory organs, avoiding distractions. MeditAMAmente has four interfaces: one containing an introduction to the dynamics of the \"Slow Meditation Program\"; another providing access to 10-minute daily audio-guided meditaçãos lasting six weeks, each with a specific theme; one containing the \"Logbook,\" where participants can describe their perceptions of the meditative practice; and the last containing questions for interaction about breastfeeding in the \"Fact or Fiction\" format. The use of technology in promoção da saúde is recommended by the World Health Organization and has become increasingly common. Among the resources employed in published meditação protocols and research, especially in the postpartum period, the use of a commercial app, audio management via mobile messaging, and in-person delivery stand out. However, it is still difficult to find a commercial app that adequately meets the needs of audio-guided meditação research, especially regarding access control and listening time. These limitations directly affect the interpretation of resultados and the assessment of participants' actual meditação practice time. Technology has expanded the possibilities for conducting meditação research. However, to conduct our study, we identified the need to create our own platform: the meditAMAmente Interactive Website. The tool demonstrates potential for facilitating both the logistics of delivering the audio in the planned sequence and access control. In addition to being a customized platform, it provides integration between quantitative and qualitativo research, lending greater robustness to the results found in the randomized ensaio clínico.",

    "abstract": "Among the wide variety of medicinal plants currently available on the fitoterapia market, Cannabis sativa has stood out in the last decade as one of the most promising plants in the health field the therapeutic properties of phytocannabinoids is an area that is still in the process of development; some evidence has already been substantially consolidated. However, many doubts hang over controversial scientific findings, sparking debate in the health sciences community, with many experts pondering the benefits and potential efeitos adversos of cannabis. With regard to cardiovascular health and the use of cannabis (medicinal or not), most of the studies carried out show that this use is a risk factor for the development of cardiovascular diseases. In order to survey the state of the art in research involving the themes of \"medical cannabis\" and \"cardiovascular system\", a narrative literature review was carried out in the main health databases. The databases used for this narrative review were the main references in the health area, mainly PUBMED, the Virtual Health Library (BVS/BIREME) and the CAPES Catalogue of Theses and Dissertations. Search strategies were devised in accordance with the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH terms) and Health Sciences Descriptors (DeCS), PUBMED and VHL descriptor databases successively. The results were collected in Research Information Systems (RIS) format and then stored in Mendeley software for managing bibliographical references. Of the 207 studies included in the literature review, the first publications took place in the 70s and increased exponentially after the 2000s. The studies predominantly investigated human populations (n=101) and in terms of method, revisão sistemáticas (n=68) were found in greater numbers, followed by experiments (n=58) and ensaio clínicos (n=17). Regarding the clinical resultados, cardiovascular function was the most prominent (n=11), followed by vascular diseases (n=10) and multiple cardiovascular resultados in a single study (n=10). Regarding the intervençãos used in the studies, recreational cannabis (n=42) was the most researched, followed by the intervenção of using standardised cannabis cigarettes (n=12) and injecting cannabis extract (n=10). It can be seen that there are a large number of animal experiments aimed at finding answers about the therapeutic effects or physiological mechanisms of active ingredients, most of which have obtained potentially positive and positive results. The use of cannabis (medicinal or recreational) influences and affects the cardiovascular system, but there are not enough conclusive findings to establish a specific definition of the therapeutic applications of the different types of phytocannabinoids for cardiovascular resultados. Theres any clarity about the findings on the harmful effects of cannabis use; most of the results found come from observational studies that used population analyses on cannabis users of unknown origin. It is necessary to carry out clinical studies on the use of medicinal and recreational cannabis using different profiles of patients who strictly do not use any other type of substance or medication, using a cannabis herbal ingredient from a legally recognised source, with adequate quality control from its planting to the processing of its raw materials and the making of its extracts.",

    "abstract": "In Switzerland, the cAH is the only professionalizing center in Naturopathy/TCIM that gathers Education, Clinical practice and Research under the same roof. Accredited at a national level with one of the highest educational standards worldwide (4,000+ hours) according to the World Naturopathic Federation classification, the cAH takes care of the education of approximately 70 naturopaths each year, specialized in Traditional European Medicine, Ayurvedic Medicine, Traditional Chinese Medicine or Homeopathy. On its way to becoming a private university by 2035, the cAH transforms itself from a standard-setting school - preparing students to pass examinations - to a professionalizing center - training the next generation of TCIM professionals. Drawing on methods and models from various fields of research (cognitive sciences, neurosciences, educational engineering, psychology, sociology, anthropology etc.), its Education & Learning experience department launched a new Professionalizing Module (PM) in September 2023. With a new way of using teaching spaces, tools, practices and timescales, the PMs content and format intend to foster the combination of theoretical and experiential learning, active student participation and empowerment, individual self-reflective guided work, peer-to-peer learning in small or large groups, work before/during/after the class etc. Through a 14-step course spread over 2 acadêmico years, the path follows a learning experience logic (rather than a thematic modular logic) which guides the students to work on different attitudes separately (like layers of onion) and then merge and embody them. The expected output is a personalized career plan and identity as future naturopaths. The PM comprises: - Six 2-day seminars, each focusing on specific attitudes: therapist, experimenter, researcher, entrepreneur, networker, etc. - Eight 1-day checkpoints, covering topics such as professional ethics, intra- and interpersonal communication, legal aspects and patient rights, network building, value proposition and branding development, business model, expert inspiration, etc. - One portfolio to support the end-of-module assessment, including: a business plan, a clinical case study, a photolanguage activity, self-reflective reports, etc. Our educational program evaluation study used a qualitativo methodology with 25 students during 2 years. We present preliminary results evaluating the following PM learning objectives : - Development of intrapersonal skills and self-knowledge - Development of business skills and inter-professional networking skills - Development of interpersonal skills in ethics, communication, legal aspects, patient rights - Development of a scientific and research-oriented mindset, an baseado em evidence practice and practice-based research - Development of a personal vision of integrative healthcare with a clear positioning within the global healthcare ecosystem In the short term, the PM seems to be very useful for the naturopaths development and for the patient's benefit. In the mid to long term, we expect that this type of innovative learning experience will contribute to creating the TCIM professionals of the future, who are prepared to act as change agents of the healthcare system, and are able to adapt their practice to the population's evolving needs.",

    "abstract": "Diabetic foot ulcers will remain a serious complication of type 2 diabetes, often leading to infection, troublesome cicatrization, and, in some cases, amputation. These resultados are expected to be worsened by chronic hyperglycemia, peripheral neuropathy, and poor vascularization. Nursing will play a crucial role in wound care, patient education, and preventive strategies. However, advanced wound care technologies will often be costly and inaccessible. yurveda, the traditional Indian medical system, offers a holistic approach based on metabolic types (doas) and the therapeutic properties of natural substances (dravyas), enabling personalized care through diet, lifestyle, and medicinal plants. This study will propose a therapeutic protocol for diabetic foot ulcers grounded in Ayurvedic principles, combining doa-based metabolic profiling with Brazilian medicinal plants that share gua (qualities) and karma (actions) with Ayurvedic herbs. The goal will be to adapt Indian tratamentos to a local context and prepare for a future randomized ensaio clínico. This integrative approach aims to offer a low-cost, culturally relevant alternative to improve patient resultados and nursing strategies in chronic wound care, including applications in saúde pública services. Diabetic foot ulcers remain a severe complication of type 2 diabetes, often leading to infection, troublesome cicatrization, and, in some cases, amputation. These resultados are exacerbated by chronic hyperglycemia, peripheral neuropathy, and impaired vascularization. Nursing plays a pivotal role in wound care, patient education, and preventive strategies. However, advanced wound care technologies are frequently costly and inaccessible, especially within saúde pública systems. yurveda, the traditional Indian medical system, offers a holistic approach centered on individualized dietary and lifestyle adjustments (hra-vihra), aligned with the patient's metabolic state (doas), and the therapeutic use of medicinal plants (dravyas) mapped by specific actions (karma). This study proposes developing a therapeutic protocol for diabetic foot ulcers, integrating doa-based metabolic profiling with Brazilian medicinal plants that can be correlated to gua (qualities/chemical structures) and karma (therapeutic actions) from Ayurvedic pharmacopoeia. The goal is to adapt effective Indian tratamentos to local resources and cultural contexts, offering a low-cost, integrative strategy for chronic wound care. The expected resultado is a structured therapeutic protocol integrating Ayurvedic concepts and Brazilian phytoterapia into nursing practice. The project anticipates producing a plant matrix organized by wound healing steps and corresponding gua/karma, enabling systematic application in clinical settings. Preliminary indicators for wound assessment will include wound size reduction, reepithelialization time, pain levels, inflammation markers, and sensory function recovery. Stakeholder feedback will guide iterative refinements, ensuring protocol applicability, acceptability, and adherence in real-world contexts. This protocol design phase aims to bridge Ayurvedic knowledge, nursing practice, and Brazilian phytoterapia into an integrative, low-cost wound care strategy. The resulting model will provide a foundation for future randomized ensaio clínicos, fostering interdisciplinary research and expanding integrative healthcare approaches within saúde pública systems.",

    "abstract": "The research aimed to discuss the use of flower essence terapia in women during the climacteric period and to evaluate its effects on women presenting signs and symptoms associated with this stage, with regard to the Blatt-Kupperman Menopausal Index and the psychological and spiritual well-being scales. It also aimed to compare the efetividade of flower essence terapia between the control group and the group receiving the flower essence formula. The research was developed using a descriptive quantitative approach, using experimental research through the ensaio clínico method. Fieldwork was conducted at the Integrated Assistance Research Program (PIPA) at the Anna Nery School of Nursing and the Faculty of Nursing at UERJ. Participants were women aged 40 to 65 who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Data collection consisted of semi-structured interviews, including floral terapia consultations and the application of the Psychological Well-Being Scale (EBEP) and Spiritual Well-Being Scale (EBE). Monitoring was conducted for four consecutive months, with a monthly consultation. The study was submitted to the Research Ethics Committee and received approval number 6.875.023. The statistical program used for sample size calculation was G*Power version 3.1.9.2. The group selection criterion was double-blind randomization. Fifty-one women participated in the study; 33 in the intervenção group and 18 in the control group. There were 16 losses to follow-up; 6 in the intervenção group and 10 in the control group. Data were analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics version 24. Regarding the menopausal index, the Friedman test showed a significant difference between the Kuppermam-Blatt questionnaire score categories between the visits for the control group, intervenção group, and overall. Therefore, in all three groups, there was an increase in the mild category from the first visit to the fourth visit. However, the percentage increase in the control group was 133.33%, while in the intervenção group, this increase was 266.67%, and the overall percentage increase was 300.00%. Thus, we can conclude that the group that used the floral formula \"Living the Climacteric\" had a greater reduction in the signs and symptoms reported in the first consultation. Regarding the psychological well-being scale, there was statistical significance for the domain of positive relationships with others, in the control group, where in the first consultation the average score was 78.8 points (±4.9 points) and reduced in the fourth consultation to 77.5 points (±6.3 points) (p = 0.049). For the spiritual well-being scale, there was no significant difference between the groups. The results indicate that flower terapia can be one of the care technologies to assist women in this transitional phase of their life cycle. We emphasize the need for further studies to expand the scientific evidence.",

    "abstract": "Ayurveda, an ancient holistic health system, originated in India. It addresses well-being holistically, considering the physical body, mind, emotions, and spirit. This system has gained increasing attention as a complementary and alternative practice for various health conditions, including those related to the female reproductive system. In Ayurveda, it is highlighted by specific branches such as \"Prasuti Tantra\" (obstetrics) and \"Stri Roga\" (gynecology), which are dedicated to promoting women's health through proper nutrition, disease prevenção, and specialized tratamentos. This article explores the Ayurvedic classification of the uterus, known as Garbhashaya, and its healthy functioning about the Sapta Dhatus (seven body tissues) and the Doshas (Vata, Pitta, Kapha). It also explores some Ayurvedic tratamentos and therapeutic approaches based on evidence from case studies and literature reviews. We are conducting an integrative review of the Google Academic Database. As we were studying a discipline called Health and Spirutuality, we searched articles using the following descriptors (dysmenorrhea ayurvedic tratamento) from March until July 2025. We found twenty four articles. Our inclusion criteria was articles that related Ayurvedic Tradicion tratamento and our exclusion criteria was thouse that did not use, and we used ten to presente the results referring to the tratamento of uterine illness, which are presented in tables. All the articles selected presente good results with these tratamentos. The term Garbhashaya is derived from the Sanskrit words \"Garbha\" (fetus) and \"Aashaya\" (space or dwelling), the anatomical region where fetal development occurs. It is recognized as the \"eighth Ashaya,\" a special cavity or location present specifically in the female body that serves as the site where the Garbha resides and develops. Any abnormality related to the uterus can compromise implantation capacity and, consequently, lead to infertility. Ayurvedic tratamento can help restore health. Therapeutic intervençãos include Panchakarma, Oral Herbal Medications, Diet, and lifestyle modifications: - Panchakarma Therapies: (1) Abhyanga (Therapeutic Oil Massage); (2) Swedana (steam on the lower abdomen); (3) Basti Karma (Medicated Enema). - Oral Herbs: (1) Ashwagandha Churna (reduces menstrual pain and mental health). (2) Shatavari Kalpa (reproductive system, hormones, and uterine tone). (3) Hingwashtaka Churna (digestion, reduces constipation; relieves cramping pain and muscle spasms). (4) Triphala Guggulu (eliminates \"Ama\" (toxins) and regulates metabolism). - Diet and Lifestyle Modifications: (1) Pathya Ahara (Vata-Pitta pacifying diet: Warm, light, easily digestible foods). (2) Hydration (herbal teas like Ajwain, Ginger, and Dashamoola Kwath). (3) Yoga (Butterfly and Reclining Butterfly poses, and alternate breathing). Ayurvedic tratamento can help recover uterus health within a few months. This Traditional Medicine has been used in many areas of health tratamentos of human beings and animals for millennia in Índia. In the last two hundred years, since England dominated that region, a lot of this knowledge has been translated into European languages and practices. Yet, it needs to be more divulged in many countries, like Brazil. Although we also have our tratamentos here to are known from our Native People in the Amazon Forest.",

    "abstract": "Over the past decades, Chinese Medicine has increasingly been absorbed by Western medical scienceespecially through biomedical methods that privilege randomized ensaio clínicos and external diagnostic categories. This process, characterized as scientific colonization, marginalizes foundational elements of Chinese Medicineits philosophy, cosmology and medical doctrinecompromising both its theoretical integrity and therapeutic efficacy. A critical analysis was conducted of the scientific literature on Chinese Medicine and of the guidelines that inform research designs. Two emblematic case studies were selected for in-depth examination. Theoretical framing draws on Boaventura de Sousa Santos, who developed the concept of colonization in science and proposed non-colonizing science; Michel Foucault, whose archaeology of knowledge highlights historicity and power relations in knowledge production; and Madel Luz, who created and advanced the concept of Medical Rationality within the health sciences. These authors underpin our critique of the consequences of imposing colonial research methods and the imperative for plural, non-colonizing epistemologies. The predominance of biomedical methods and the adoption of Western diagnostic categories (Bianbing) over traditional Chinese diagnostic patterns (Bianzheng) diminish the complexity and efficacy of traditional medical systems. The concept of Medical Rationality emerges as a central tool to safeguard the autonomy and sovereignty of complex medical systems, enabling research designs aligned with their original principlessuch as the promotion of vitality and harmony. Non-colonizing research methods recognizes and values the epistemological specificities of Chinese Medicine, preventing theoretical fragmentation and loss of its conceptual chain. Exemplary case studies demonstrate that disrupting the theoretical articulation of Medical Rationalityimposed by exogenous methodscan lead to reduced therapeutic efficacy, practice distortion, and invisibilization of core aims like life cultivation and longevity. These harms underscore the need for a new research paradigm grounded in epistemological plurality and respect for the integrity of traditional medical systems. A proper understanding and application of Medical Rationality is essential for developing non-colonizing research in Chinese Medicine. This theoretical approach restores and protects the original potential of practicesoften diminished by scientific colonizationby reclaiming the breadth and therapeutic efficacy of complex medical systems. It is crucial not only for epistemological plurality but also for preserving the integrity and therapeutic power of Chinese Medicine and other traditional medical systems.",

    "abstract": "Over recent decades, critiques of scientific colonization in Chinese Medicine research have highlighted the urgent need to restore its original medical rationality and epistemological integrity. The imposition of exogenous biomedical paradigms has caused fragmentation of theoretical frameworks and compromised therapeutic efficacy in Traditional Medical Systems (TMS). Responding to these challenges and in alignment with the WHO Traditional Medicine Strategy 20252034, we present the prototype of the NCRM (Non-Colonialist Research Method) Scale: an innovative, multi-phase, and technologically enhanced methodological model designed to guide and evaluate research that preserves the epistemological core of Chinese Medicine and other complex medical systems. Objective To introduce the foundational principles and initial prototype of the NCRM Scale and checklist, a tool for assessing and guiding non-colonialist research methodologies in Chinese Medicine, with potential applicability to other traditional and integrative medical systems. The NCRM Scale project originated from a philosophical and epistemological analysis of the research methodologies and study designs commonly applied in Chinese Medicine. This critical reflection identified the need for tools that safeguard the internal coherence and theoretical integrity of traditional medical systems. The prototype of the NCRM Scale is an instrument currently under development, designed to assist researchers in constructing non-colonialist research projects. It consists of: A Checklist to ensure research designs are aligned with the epistemology, diagnostic categories, and therapeutic aims unique to Chinese Medicine; A Colonization Degree Scale to assess how much a study preserves or compromises the core theoretical framework of the analyzed medical system; A Methodological Guide offering decision-making algorithms and digital resources (including AI-based tools) to support the design of projects consistent with the NCRM principles; The integration of statistical tools that enable the evaluation of health resultados without undermining the foundational concepts of traditional systems. The NCRM framework is informed by plural epistemologiesincluding Two-Eyed Seeing, the Medicine Wheel model, and Medical Rationalityand incorporates best practices from TCIM research models. Its multi-phase development includes systematic literature synthesis (PRISMA-ComplexInt), expert consensus-building (modified e-Delphi, Q-Sort, Best-Worst Scaling), and validation across four weighted domains: Epistemological Coherence, Methodological Appropriateness, Cultural Safety & Ethics, and Innovation & Rigor. Future phases envision advanced technological integration, such as digital twin simulations, gamified citizen science applications, and adaptive AI assistance. The NCRM Scale offers clear, reproducible criteria for non-colonialist research in Chinese Medicine and complex medical systems. By prioritizing epistemological integrity and methodological pluralism, it helps restore original therapeutic objectives and full potential of a medical system. Digital tools and algorithms may support broad adoption in the future. Initial applications indicate that the NCRM framework fosters rigorous, respectful studies and serves as a valuable resource for researchers, ethics committees, and funding agencies. The NCRM Scale inaugurates a new stage in research on Chinese Medicine and traditional medical systems, moving beyond colonizing legacies and advancing a plural, effective, and epistemologically respectful science. Its methodological rigor and technological innovation make it a key instrument for preserving the diversity and integrity of traditional medical systems.",

    "abstract": "In Australia, as in other developed nations, marginalised populations have lived experience of exclusion which impacts their wellbeing through compounded economic, social, health and early life disadvantage. Evidence shows marginalised populations have consistently unmet health needs and poor health service engagement, additional to histories of negative health seeking experiences. Emergent models of interdisciplinary primary healthcare that take a comprehensive view of the health and social needs of marginalised people, hold promise for engaging these groups in consistent and coordinated healthcare that is integrative and inclusive. We present Phase 1 of an original research project employing a three-phase mixed methods approach with a case study focus, to investigate multiple stakeholder perspectives on assessing the barriers and facilitators to the implementation of integrated models of care within community-based primary health services for a marginalised demographic (Ethics Approval: ETH21-6083). Focus group fieldwork (Phase 1) was conducted separately with each of the patient, practitioner and service provider/management cohorts engaged with a case study health service that provisions integrative health and social services to people experiencing marginalisation and disadvantage. Emergent themes were explored through in-depth thematic analysis. Focus group results provided rich data for the development of concepts, themes and subthemes that explored the research topic. Themes arising from the patient-consumer focus group were grouped under the concepts: Initiating access to healthcare, Engaging with integrative services and Reporting experiences of health seeking. Themes arising from the practitioner and service provider focus groups were presented together under the concepts: Visioning inclusive values, Implementing integrated health and social care and Measuring success, replicating a unique model. The breadth and depth of the results arising from this research are discussed within a conceptual framework that identifies four spheres of influence pertaining to health seeking for populations with experience of health marginalisation: (1) Individual experience, (2) family and community context, (3) service design and provision and (4) systemic structures and policy. Key findings outline the complex circumstances that impact marginalised individuals and the way these circumstances influence individual health and experiences of health service engagement. The way community networks influence healthcare provision and health seeking is explored along with discussion of the inextricable links between social context, housing and health for marginalised populations. The importance of designing and delivering community specific health services that improve access to healthcare, promote segurança and facilitate teamwork across health and social disciplines, inclusive of integrative models of healthcare is highlighted. The impacts of política de saúde on the delivery of integrated healthcare and the ways systemic structures perpetuate health marginalisation are highlighted. Responses to meeting complex health and social needs and addressing health inequity are offered through supporting interdisciplinary, comprehensive and inclusive approaches to primary healthcare. This original research project has explored barriers and facilitators to the provision of integrated healthcare within primary healthcare settings for marginalised populations, from multiple stakeholder perspectives. The findings provide insight into the acceptability of expanding the scope of healthcare to meet health and social complexity amongst marginalised populations.",

    "abstract": "Health systems should serve as social responses to the health needs of the population. In recent years, there has been a growing demand for Integrative and Complementary Practices (PICs) in Western countries, reflecting a shift in how people seek healthcare. In Brazil, the National Policy on Integrative and Complementary Practices (PNPIC) was established by the Ministry of Health in 2006. This policy incorporates meditaçãoa practice rooted in Traditional Chinese Medicineamong other modalities, into the services offered by the Unified Health System (SUS). These intervençãos are known for being accessible, low-cost, and supported by scientific evidence regarding their efetividade. Meditation, originally from Eastern traditions, began to draw scientific interest in the West during the 1970s. This study aims to analyze the contributions and impacts of meditação on SUS users with dor crônica, particularly those requiring more individualized and humanized care within a highly complex healthcare institution. A qualitativo research study was conducted using the action-research methodology. Semi-structured interviews were carried out prior to the intervenção. The proposed intervenção consisted of eight weeks of Mindfulness Meditation combined with Awareness Through Movement lessons based on the Feldenkrais Method®. A numerical pain scale was used both before and after the intervenção to assess changes in pain perception. Following the eight-week program, a focus group was conducted to further evaluate the indicators explored during the initial interviews. Additionally, a control group was included in the study, with two semi-structured interviews conducted eight weeks apart. The results were as follows: a reduction in pain and insomnia, an increase in self-care, an improvement in social relationships, and a change in worldview through self-reflection. Benefits were observed in the group practice both through meditative exercises and Consciousness Through Movement, and these benefits were shared with family and friends as well as incorporated into daily life. The initial group was composed of six women and four men; by the end, three men and four women remained. It was observed that the participants approved of these practices and noticed the benefits associated with meditação not only within the hospital context but also in their everyday lives. In the control group, no such changes in the factors mentioned above were observed after the second interview. The practice of atenção plena and awareness through movement reduces intervenção costs, improves the qualidade de vida of SUS users, and promotes overall health. Longitudinal studies are needed to monitor the sustainability of these results.",

    "abstract": "The triple planetary crisisclimate change, biodiversity loss, and pollutionrepresents a major saúde pública threat. Health professionals play a key role in promoting sustainable practices and guiding communities toward healthier lifestyles. While environmental attitudes can influence behavior, they are shaped by awareness, motivation, and opportunity. In Costa Rica, despite environmental leadership, the health sector lacks formal training in planetary health and climate change. This gap limits the sectors ability to respond to emerging challenges. Assessing health professionals knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors is essential to promote climate-resilient healthcare and support national efforts in adaptation and mitigation. Objective: To identify attitudes and practices related to planetary health and climate change among healthcare professionals in Costa Rica. A descriptive, observational, cross-sectional study was conducted using an anonymous online survey aimed at healthcare professionals in Costa Rica between January and June 2024. The survey employed the T-CHANT tool, originally developed by Schent et al. and adapted to Latin American tropical settings. The Spanish version was psychometrically validated in Costa Rica, with a Cronbachs alpha of 0.88. The instrument included 13 sociodemographic questions and 22 Likert-scale items grouped into five dimensions: awareness, experience, concern and motivation, behaviors, and closure. Sampling was non-probabilistic (snowball type), beginning with a convenience sample. Inclusion criteria included voluntary participation, active practice of a health profession, and Costa Rican residency. Exclusion applied to non-residents. Several professional associations collaborated in disseminação the survey via email and social media, using the Qualtrics platform to ensure data integrity and prevent duplicate responses. Participating associations included nursing, terapia, veterinary medicine, social work, psychology, and health sciences. To ensure national geographic coverage, initial seed participants were selected from six regions and invited colleagues from their areas. A total of 274 valid responses were collected. Data analysis was conducted using Jamovi and RStudio, with both descriptive and inferential statistical methods. The study was approved by the Scientific Ethics Committee of the National University. All participants gave informed consent. The sample was mostly women with bachelor's degrees in professions such as nursing, medicine and dentistry, with a predominance from the central region of the country. Low awareness was identified regarding the responsibility of the health sector regarding climate change, although the general concern is high regarding changes in the planet, impact on generations, and effects on health. There is motivation in the participants to prepare for the impacts on health and to reduce the carbon footprint of healthcare, as well as in teaching clients. Regarding behaviors, the need to improve the choice of sustainable food and the use of non-fossil energy sources at home and at work was identified as areas for improvement in transportation, waste reduction and leadership. Although most professionals exhibited positive environmental attitudes, these did not always translate into corresponding behaviors, highlighting the need to improve professional training to promote sustainability in both professional practice and personal life among individuals in the healthcare sector.",

    "abstract": "Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by impaired insulin production or action, a hormone produced by the pancreas. Projections indicate a rise in prevalence from 643 million cases in 2030 to 783 million by 2045. Given the significant global burden of DM, the discovery of novel therapeutic agents to manage this disorder remains a critical health priority. In this context, natural products represent a promising source of bioactive compounds for controlling diabetes, offering potential alternatives to conventional pharmacoterapia. On the other hand, Brazilian biodiversity, particularly the Cerrado biome, has significant potential for the discovery of new natural products from medicinal plants, which are an integral part of the relationship between health and Traditional, Complementary and Integrative Medicine (TCIM). The Cerrado biome, a designated biodiversity hotspot, is home to several plant species used by local communities for their medicinal properties, including those beneficial for diabetes. Therefore, new initiatives to promote sustainable development, linking health and the environment, are essential. Psidium laruotteanum Cambess. (Pl), from the Myrtaceae family, is native to the Cerrado and can be found in Conservation Units areas in the Federal District. This study investigated the -amylase and -glucosidase inhibition potential of ethanolic (EEPI) and aqueous (EAPI) extracts, hydrolate (HPI), and essential oil (EOPI) from the leaves of PI to evaluate their role in managing postprandial hyperglycemia. Ethanolic extraction was carried out by maceration, aqueous extraction was by infusion and hydrolate and essential oil were obtained by steam desiltation.Then, the ethanol extract (EE), aqueous extract (EA), hydrolate (H) and essential oil (EO) of P. laruotteanum leaves were investigated for enzymatic inhibition of -amylase and -glucosidase, using a serial curve to determine the IC50 (1.95-500 g/mL) by colorimetric methods, described by Bernfeld and Shinde. Ethanolic extract (EEPl) exhibited moderate -amylase inhibition (IC50 = 70.14 g/mL, acarbose, IC50 = 4.23 g/mL). Notably, EEPI and EAPI demonstrated potent -glucosidase inhibition (IC50 values of 5.07 g/mL and 6.94 g/mL, respectively), outperforming the positive control, deoxynojirimycin (IC50 = 28.83 g/mL). HPl and EOPl showed no activity. These findings suggest the inhibitory specificity of P. laruotteanum extracts for -glucosidase inhibition, supporting its potential as a source of compounds to control postprandial hyperglycemia. These preliminary results underscore the dual imperative of biodiversity conservation and bioprospecting for sustainable drug discovery. Further bioguided isolation of bioactive constituents is warranted, aligned with global strategies to integrate TCIM evidence into saúde pública solutions while promoting ecological conservation.",

    "abstract": "Ayurveda is a traditional Indian system of medicine with over 3,000 years of documented use. In Brazil, Ayurveda is officially recognized as part of the National Policy on Integrative and Complementary Practices. Its pharmacological approach is based on complex herbal formulations, often combined with mineral or animal-derived substances. Despite its global expansion and formal recognition as a traditional and complementary medical system by the World Health Organization, regulatory barriers remain a major obstacle to the international integration of Ayurvedic herbal products. This study investigates how different countries regulate these products, with a focus on identifying strategic lessons to inform potential frameworks in Brazil. A qualitativo, multi-method approach was employed. First, a documentary analysis was conducted using official regulatory texts, legislation, and pharmacopeias from 13 countries selected for their relevance to the Ayurvedic herbal products market and data accessibility. A structured questionnaire was developed in partnership with the All India Institute of Ayurveda (AIIA) and sent to representatives of regulatory agencies and experts in 17 countries, with responses received from 5. As it involved only foreign professionals and no Brazilian participants, ethics approval and informed consent were not required, in accordance with Resolution CNS nº 510/2016. The data collected were analyzed using thematic coding with MAXQDA software. Additionally, SWOT matrices were developed for each country to synthesize the regulatory landscape and identify strategic patterns. Among the 13 countries analyzedGermany, Australia, Bangladesh, Brazil, Bhutan, Canada, the United States, India, Japan, Nepal, the United Kingdom, Sri Lanka, and Switzerlandsix have specific regulations for Ayurvedic herbal products: India, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bangladesh, Bhutan, and Australia. These countries recognize Ayurvedic formulations via dedicated regulatory pathways and official pharmacopeias. Others regulate such products as dietary supplements or natural health products. India features a comprehensive framework with specific categorization and quality standards. SWOT analyses indicate that robust regulatory systems share strengths in official compendia, specialized advisory bodies, and risk-based classification. Key weaknesses include lack of formal recognition (Japan), stringent traditional use requirements (Europe, Canada), and regulatory gaps (Brazil). Opportunities include expanding global demand and regulatory harmonization; threats involve import barriers and challenges reconciling traditional formulations with modern standards. Overall, countries with defined traditional use criteria, institutionalized standards, and adapted approval processes achieve better integration of Ayurvedic herbal products. The study reveals a heterogeneous and fragmented international regulatory landscape for Ayurvedic herbal products. While some countries provide structured and inclusive regulatory models, others present legal and institutional voids that hinder product registration and commercialization. In Brazil, there is no defined regulatory framework for its products. Based on the international experiences analyzed, we suggest that any future regulatory development in Brazil could thoughtfully and contextually consider recognizing traditional Ayurvedic references, accepting long-standing use as supporting evidence of efficacy, adopting pharmacopeial standards for quality assurance, and establishing a dedicated technical advisory committee.",

    "abstract": "Background and objectives Hospitalisation is a potentially distressing experience for children and their families, often accompanied by emotional, psychological, and physical discomfort. Humanising care through complementary and integrative health practices (CIHP), such as music-based intervençãos (MBIs), has demonstrated beneficial effects in specific paediatric populations. However, evidence in general paediatric hospital settings remains limited. This study aimed to assess the impact of an MBI on perceived stress and the subjective experience of hospitalisation among paediatric patients and their caregivers. Methods It was a quasi-experimental study, cross-sectional, with a mixed-methods approach, conducted in a paediatric ward of a teaching hospital affiliated with the University of São Paulo. The study carried out in two phases: (I) a quantitative evaluation of perceived stress using a visual analogue scale (VAS) before and after the intervenção; and (II) a qualitativo analysis of caregivers perceptions through semi- structured interviews. The intervenção included 2040 minutes of live music using string instruments (kantele or lyre), complemented by age-appropriate singing and spoken word. Quantitative data were analysed using the Wilcoxon test; qualitativo data underwent content analysis and lexical analysis via IRAMUTEQ software. Results A total of 125 children (mean age: 30.6 months) and their caregivers participated in Phase I. A significant reduction in perceived stress was observed in both children/adolescents and caregivers (p < 0.001), with a large effect size (1.0). All participants approved the intervenção, and 74.4% reported behavioural improvements in the children. Phase II included 30 interviews, which revealed overwhelmingly positive perceptions of the intervenção. Caregivers described the hospital environment as stressful and isolating but reported that the MBI provided relaxation, comfort, and emotional relief for both children and themselves. Conclusions The findings highlight the potential of MBIs as an effective, safe and non-pharmacological strategy to reduce stress and enhance the hospital experience for paediatric patients and their families. Incorporating music-based practices into routine paediatric care may foster more welcoming, humanised environments that address the emotional needs of children and caregivers.",

    "abstract": "Ozone is a triatomic oxygen molecule and a powerful oxidizing agent. In medicine, ozone is administered as a mixture of pure medical oxygen and ozone, a practice known as Ozone Therapy when applied within a defined therapeutic segurança window. Medicinal ozone interacts with cell membrane phospholipids, triggering systemic effects primarily through activation of the Nrf2 pathway. This promotes physiological rebalancing, particularly in oxidative stress, inflammation, and hypoxia modulation. Ozone terapia is used in over 50 countries and was officially recognized in Brazil as a complementary integrative practice in 2018. The current evidence gap map aims to highlight the role of Integrative Medicine, particularly Ozone Therapy, across various clinical conditions. First published by BIREME in October 2019 and updated in 2022, this was Brazils inaugural evidence map and has become a key reference. It can be accessed at: https://research.bvsalud.org/portal/resource/pt/lis-47377. Developed by BIREME/PAHO/WHO with SOBOM/WFOT, the map offers a comprehensive overview of evidence and existing gaps. The map is based on a comprehensive literature review (20062022), encompassing 26 studies: 18 revisão sistemáticas, 1 revisão sistemática with metanálise, 3 revisão sistemáticas of RCTs, 3 meta-analyses, and 1 scoping review. It followed BIREMEs methodology, based on the 3iE framework. Searches were performed in EMBASE, PubMed, and the Virtual Health Library using MeSH and DeCS terms for ozone terapia. The AMSTAR tool assessed methodological quality: 10 reviews had high confidence, 3 moderate, 10 low, and 3 critically low. The reviews were mapped across six intervenção types (parenteral oxygen/ozone gas, parenteral ozonated water, systemic administration, ozonated water for topical use, topical gas, and ozonated oil) and 55 health resultados (cancer, infection, inflammation, pain, wound healing, qualidade de vida, and efeitos adversos), resulting in 334 intervenção-resultado associations. Parenteral ozone gas was most frequently studied (192 associations, 57%). Among the total associations, 154 showed positive or potentially positive effects, 132 were inconclusive, and 8 showed no effect. Overall tratamento effects included 14 positive, 5 potentially positive, 5 inconclusive, and 2 showing no effect. A bubble chart visualizes study volume, with bubble size reflecting the number of supporting studies (1, 2, or 3). The analysis highlights ozone terapias broad potential in pain reduction (including lower back pain), improved physical function, healing, infection and inflammation reduction, and qualidade de vida improvements. This evidence map outlines ozone terapias therapeutic potential in managing pain, inflammation, infections, and wound healing, with no reports of severe efeitos adversos. The terapia is presented as a safe, low-cost, integrative tratamento option. The map strengthens the scientific credibility and clinical confidence in prescribing ozone terapia, while identifying areas requiring further research.",

    "abstract": "Glioma represents one of the most aggressive and lethal forms of brain cancer, characterized by high cellular heterogeneity, invasive behavior, and resistance to standard therapies. Despite advances in surgical, chemotherapeutic, and radiotherapeutic approaches, prognosis remains poor, and tratamento-related side effects often compromise both therapeutic efficacy and patients qualidade de vida. As a result, there is a growing interest in complementary strategies aimed at improving tratamento resultados and tolerability. Among these, phytocannabinoids have emerged as promising candidates due to their reported anticancer, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective properties. While the major cannabinoids THC and CBD have been extensively studied, the therapeutic potential of minor cannabinoids such as Cannabigerol (CBG), Cannabichromene (CBC), Cannabinol (CBN), and Cannabidivarin (CBDV) remains largely underexplored, especially in glioma. This study investigates the anticancer properties of minor cannabinoids in vitro and evaluates the potential benefit of combining them with melatonin (MLT), a neurohormone known for its oncostatic, antioxidant, and cytoprotective activities. Human glioblastoma cell lines U87, T98, and U251 were treated with individual minor cannabinoids (CBG, CBC, CBN, and CBDV), both alone and in combination with melatonin. Cell viability was assessed via standard metabolic assays, while cell death was evaluated using cytotoxicity markers. Western blot analysis was employed to investigate molecular changes, including DNA damage response markers such as H2AX. All tested minor cannabinoids induced a significant reduction in cell viability in glioma cells after 72 hours of tratamento. Moreover, enhanced cell death was observed within 48 hours, correlating with increased levels of H2AX, indicating activation of DNA damage pathways. Importantly, the combination of cannabinoids with sub-optimal doses of melatonin further potentiated these cytotoxic effects across all three cell lines, suggesting a possible synergistic interaction. These findings support a dual mechanism of action involving both direct anticancer effects and melatonin-mediated enhancement of cellular sensitivity to cannabinoid-induced stress. The observed efficacy across multiple glioblastoma lines underscores the potential robustness of this combinatorial strategy. Our in vitro data demonstrate that minor phytocannabinoids exert cytotoxic effects in glioblastoma cells and that their combination with melatonin may enhance therapeutic efficacy. These results provide a preclinical rationale for considering minor cannabinoids and melatonin as a complementary integrative approach for glioma tratamento. Given their favorable tolerability profiles and multi-targeted actions, these compounds warrant further investigation in animal models and clinical settings to assess pharmacokinetics, therapeutic windows, and synergistic potential with conventional therapies. Ultimately, this integrative strategy may contribute to the development of more effective and less debilitating tratamento options for glioma patients.

    "abstract": "Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most malignant and aggressive form of brain tumor, characterized by high recurrence rates despite standard chemoterapia and radioterapia. Several studies have demonstrated the significant cytotoxic effects of phytocannabinoids (PCs)primarily cannabidiol (CBD) and 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)in GBM cell lines, animal models, and even supported by a ensaio clínico. However, limited evidence is available regarding the effects of PCs in combination with other integrative therapies. In this study, we provide new evidence of a synergistic effect of THC, CBD, and cannabigerol (CBG) when combined with melatonin (MLT). The tested compounds, both individually and in combination, exhibited cytotoxic activity against human GBM cell lines. Human GBM cell lines (U251, T98, and U87) were treated with THC, CBD or CBG and MLT. Cytotoxicity was assessed using the MTT assay. Autophagy and cell death were evaluated by Western blotting, confocal microscopy, and flow cytometry analysis. Treatment with THC, CBD, CBG and MLT significantly reduced cell viability of GBM cell lines by inducing autophagic cell death. Moreover, the findings of this study suggest that the combination of phytocannabinoids with MLT exerts a synergistic cytotoxic effect on human GBM cell lines. These data support the hypothesis that integrative therapeutic approaches may overcome some limitations of current standard therapies for GBM, which are often associated with high rates of resistance and recurrence. Although promising, these in vitro results warrant further validation in in vivo GBM models, to assess the pharmacokinetics, bioavailability, and potential interactions of these compounds. Additionally, mechanistic studies are needed to elucidate the precise molecular pathways involved in the observed effects. Grant: The project was supported by PRIN 2020 (Prot:2020Z73J5A_005)",

    "abstract": "Integrative Community Therapy (ICT) is a collective therapeutic approach that promotes the sharing of experiences, aiming at personal and community empowerment. Included in the National Policy for Integrative and Complementary Practices of the Unified Health System (PNPIC-SUS) in 2017, ICT stands out as the only genuinely Brazilian Integrative Community Health Practice (PICS). The aim is to analyze the structuring concepts of ICT training within the framework of Raul Gagliardi's Theory of Structuring Concepts, articulated with the theoretical perspectives of Paulo Freire and Pierre Bourdieu. We use the theory of structuring concepts because the abstract is an excerpt from a thesis under development, which focuses on investigating the training path of community therapists and the pedagogical resources employed. The structuring concepts present in the training material, the book \"Community Therapy Step by Step,\" were mapped and Discursive Textual Analysis (DTA) was applied in two phases: (1) initial identification and categorization of concepts; (2) cross-referencing these concepts with the frameworks of Freire and Bourdieu. Care emerges as a structuring concept, not only as a technique, but as a way of being with others, supported by horizontal relationships and qualified listening. This care is realized as it intertwines with empathy, which is fundamental to recognizing the uniqueness of each individual and embracing their experiences. At the same time, by promoting spaces for collective listening, care enhances resilience processes, favoring the reconstruction of meaning in the face of life's adversities. Valuing popular, traditional, and local knowledge expands care beyond the biomedical, promoting the integration of knowledge and the recognition of multiple forms of care. This movement strengthens the autonomy of individuals by inviting them to actively participate in the production of their own care and contributes to individual and collective empowerment, reconfiguring the historically passive roles of users in the healthcare field. Thus, care is constituted as a relational, political, and transformative practice, capable of articulating subjective, social, and cultural dimensions toward a more humanized and inclusive model of care. The Freirean perspective emphasizes the role of dialogue and awareness in building autonomy, as it allows individuals to recognize their historical and social condition, developing the capacity to act in the world, which is fundamental in the formative processes focused on healthcare and the promotion of citizenship. Bourdieu's theory deepens the analysis of disputes in the healthcare field, which is structured by asymmetrical power relations, as biomedical knowledge imposes its legitimacy by subjugating other knowledge. In this sense, agents position themselves, resist, or adapt within these relationships, contributing to the reproduction or transformation of existing hierarchies We conclude that these concepts not only facilitate ICT training, but also enrich the understanding of ICT training processes and offer support for new pedagogical proposals within the scope of the PNPIC and the SUS, aiming at more ethical, humane and transformative care.",

    "abstract": "Health literacy, defined as the ability to access, understand, evaluate, and apply information to make informed decisions, is essential to improving communication between professionals and patients, and to fostering greater autonomy for individuals and communities in comprehensive healthcare. In medical education, its teaching has been increasingly encouraged, with recommendations to integrate it transversally throughout the entire training, as is also the case in health policies on promoção da saúde, humanization, and primary healthcare. Simultaneously, medical rationalities recognized as complex and complementary medicineshomeopatia and Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)focus on individuals in their health-disease processes and on a holistic view of care. They act synergistically to promote autonomy and health, thus contributing to health literacy. These rationalities have been gradually incorporated into health services, especially in primary healthcare (PHC). However, they are part of the curriculum in only a few medical schools in Brazil, most often as elective courses. This study aims to assess the possibilities and limitations of teaching the medical specialties of homeopatia and acupunturarecognized in Brazil by the Federal Medical Council since 1980 and 1995, respectivelyin the context of Brazilian medical education, focusing on the development of competencies related to health literacy. This is a narrative literature review, including articles, dissertations, theses, and official documents published from 2006when the National Policy on Integrative and Complementary Practices was established, recognizing TCM and homeopatia as relevant practices in comprehensive healthcarethrough 2024. This approach was chosen due to the breadth of material selection, considering the scarcity of publications addressing homeopatia, TCM/acupuntura, health literacy, and medical education together. The databases consulted were the Virtual Health Library, PubMed, and OasisBR, in Portuguese, English, and Spanish. The main findings regarding the roles of homeopatia and TCM/acupuntura in health literacy and medical education include: (1) valuing patients life stories and traditional knowledge; (2) enhancing patients understanding of the health-disease process, expanding clinical perspectives and strengthening patient protagonism; (3) promoting autonomy and self-care; (4) contributing to health education and promotion; (5) reducing pharmaceutical drug use; (6) supporting chronic disease prevenção. The results highlight the potential of integrative and complementary practices to improve medical education by fostering communication and empathy skills, encouraging respect for diverse health cultures and knowledge, and reinforcing more humanized and patient-centered care. Regarding health literacy, homeopatia and TCM/acupuntura contribute to engaging individuals and communities in self-care practices, promoting health, and preventing diseases. The integration of homeopatia and TCM into medical education can strengthen understanding of self-care, improve the ability to critically interpret information, and encourage shared decision-making practices, all central elements of health literacy. This study does not intend to be exhaustive but may contribute to the debate on curriculum revision in medical schools, emphasizing the importance of more holistic and patient-centered training aligned with both national and international guidelines. Valuing health literacy as a core physician competency reinforces the social and ethical role of the profession, aligning medical practice more closely with the real needs of the population.",

    "abstract": "Informal caregivers of dependent older adults often face intense physical and emotional strain, frequently accompanied by ansiedade, exhaustion, and diminished quality of care. In this context, complementary approaches that promote well-being and encourage self-care become essential. Bach Flower Therapy, recognized as a Complementary and Integrative Practice within Brazils Unified Health System (SUS), has been used as a resource for emotional regulation. This study aimed to understand the subjective experience of informal caregivers using Bach Flower Therapy for emotional regulation in the context of home care. This qualitativo study comprised the final phase of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled ensaio clínico conducted in a municipality in São Paulo, Brazil, in partnership with the \"Melhor em Casa\" (Better at Home) Program. The trial aimed to evaluate the efetividade of Bach Flower Therapy in reducing ansiedade among informal caregivers of dependent older adults receiving home care. Participants in the qualitativo phase were those who completed the intervenção protocol and had moderate to high ansiedade levels at baseline (STAI-State > 40), caring for older adults with moderate or severe functional dependence. The intervenção group received a flower essence formula containing Impatiens, White Chestnut, Pine, Elm, Oak, and Olive, diluted in a 30% hydro-brandy solution. The control group received a placebo with identical visual and taste characteristics. Both groups took four oral drops of the solution (with or without flower essences), four times daily for four weeks. Semi-structured interviews were conducted in private at caregivers homes at the end of the intervenção (March to June 2025), recorded, and fully transcribed. Data were analyzed using thematic content analysis, including coding and categorization of findings. Interpretation was guided by a phenomenological and relational approach to care, based on the frameworks of Maurice Merleau-Ponty and Leonardo Boff. The study followed ethical standards and was approved by the Research Ethics Committee (approval no. 7.253.542). Fifteen informal caregivers participated, including fourteen women and one man, with a mean age of 57.4 years (±12.6) and average caregiving duration of 27.3 months (±25.0). Four main categories emerged: (1) improvement in emotional well-being and sleep, with reports of calmness, mental clarity, and reduced ansiedade; (2) strengthened self-care and self-esteem, with increased motivation and personal organization; (3) facilitation of elder care, with greater patience, tolerance, and fluidity in daily tasks; and (4) absence of efeitos adversos and a positive perception of the terapia due to its natural and supportive nature. Caregivers assigned a meaningful role to flower essences in their emotional coping and caregiving routines. Bach Flower Therapy was well accepted and associated with positive perceptions of well-being and caregiving quality among informal caregivers. The phenomenological and relational framework revealed that the experience with flower essences extends beyond a punctual intervenção, forming a practice of care and self-care expressed through the caregivers body, mind, and daily routine. These findings suggest that integrative therapies, when combined with attentive listening, can contribute to the humanization of home care by promoting emotional health and supporting sustainability in the caregiver role.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate the effects of aromaterapia applied in the line of acupuntura calm (Shenmen C7, Daling CS7, Taiyuan P9) evaluated by Ryodoraku and patients' subjective perceptions. Ryodoraku is a method of energetic assessment of the organism, used in acupuntura, which measures the excitability of the meridians (energy channels) by measuring the electrical resistance of the skin at specific acupuntura points. This was a quantitative and qualitativo, experimental, uncontrolled study that compared pre- and post-intervenção results. The sample consisted of 17 volunteers, aged 14 to 69, 14 female and 3 male. A structured interview was conducted, and energy levels were measured using the Ryodoraku method before and after the application of an aromatic blend of essential oils (at a concentration of 2.75%), known for their effects on mental and emotional balance, at three acupuntura points that form the \"line of calm.\" The individual remained lying on the table for 20 minutes. After the break, we directed the patient to sit up and performed another Ryodoraku measurement and interview with the same questions as the initial interview to compare the results. With a favorable ethical opinion from the Human Research Ethics Committee under No. 70087123.6.0000.5370, individuals were randomly selected according to the following inclusion criteria: over 14 years of age, regardless of gender, marital status, profession, with or without children, conscious and oriented. After the objectives and methodology were explained, they agreed to participate and signed the Consentimento Informado Form (ICF). A mean separation test was performed at significance levels of 1 and 5%, comparing the values before and after the application of the tratamento. At a 1% significance level, a difference was detected between the before and after assessments for the factors: Right P9 (Daling); Left P9; Right PC7 (Daling); Left PC7; Right C7 (Shenmen); Left C7; Right ID5 (Yanggu); Left ID5; Right TA4 (Yangchi); Right IG5 (Yangxi); Left IG5; Left F3 (Taichong); Right R4; Left R4 (Dazhong); Right VB40 (Qiuxu); Left VB40; Left E42 (Chongyang); and Well-being. For the factors Left TA4; Right BP3 (Taibai); Right F3; and Right E42 (Chongyang), there was a difference at a 5% significance level. A greater sense of well-being was reported by the study subjects and confirmed with changes in the energy levels transmitted by Ryodoraku, due to the more distributed distribution of Qi in the channels. The results were statistically significant for the energy channels P (Lung), PC (Pericardium), C (Heart), ID (Small intestine), TA (Triple heater), IG (Large intestine), F (Liver), R (Kidney), VB (Gallbladder), E (Stomach). Despite the small sample size and absence of a control group, the present study brings significant preliminary findings on the association of both therapeutic techniques, Acupuncture and Aromaterapia, for health and well-being.",

    "abstract": "Reiki is an integrative therapeutic practice based on the laying on of hands, aimed at promoting energetic balance and physical and emotional well-being. Despite its widespread use, there is still a lack of evidence describing the physiological effects of this practice on the therapist. This study aimed to evaluate, through infrared thermography, possible thermal changes in the hands of the Reiki therapist during the application of the technique. The research was conducted with seven volunteer recipients who underwent individual Reiki sessions applied by a certified therapist. The experimental protocol consisted of three phases: acclimatization (15 minutes), Reiki application to the thoracic region (15 minutes), and post-intervenção relaxation (10 minutes), totaling 40 minutes per session. The sessions were carried out in a thermally controlled environment, with ambient temperature maintained at 23°C and relative humidity between 50% and 60%, to ensure environmental stability for thermographic image acquisition. The palm temperature of the therapists hands was measured using a FLIR C2 thermal camera, with a resolution of 80x60 (4800 pixels), pixel size of 12 µm × 12 µm, and thermal sensitivity < 0.10 °C. Images were captured at three distinct time points: (1) 10 minutes after acclimatization, (2) every 30 seconds during the 15-minute Reiki session, and (3) during the 5 minutes following the end of the practice. The thermograms were analyzed using FLIR Tools+ software, and average temperatures were calculated for the central palmar regions (ROIs) of both right and left hands. The data revealed a gradual increase in the therapists hand temperature: the right hand rose from an initial 35.1°C to a maximum of 36.1°C at 900 seconds, while the left hand increased from 35.0°C to 35.9°C in the same period. After the relaxation phase, a progressive decrease in temperature was observed, returning to near-initial pre-session values. The results indicate a significant temperature variation in both hands during Reiki practice, possibly associated with peripheral vasodilation, increased local metabolism, and/or changes in the autonomic nervous system induced by the meditative state. The general symmetry between the hands, with a slight thermal predominance in the right hand, may reflect an individual pattern of energetic flow. It is concluded that thermography is a viable tool for the objective investigation of energy practices such as Reiki. Studies with larger sample sizes and inclusion of control groups are important to deepen the understanding of the mechanisms involved.",

    "abstract": "Chinese Herbal Medicine is a therapeutic technique belonging to Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). Although still relatively unknown in Brazil, it offers resources to treat various pathologies. In TCM, herbology is part of the so-called internal medicines, which act on the Zang Fu (organs and visceras), providing inputs that help the body restructure internal imbalances of Qi. Despite its specific terminology and unique way to describing pathologies, TCM dialogues with allopathic medicine and has scientific evidence supporting its results. Since 2006, Chinese Herbal Medicine has been part of the recognized practices under Brazils National Policy on Integrative and Complementary Practices (PNPIC). In Brazil, it is regulated by PNPIC, and its products are registered by ANVISA (Brazilian Health Regulatory Agency) according to RDC 901/2024. ANVISA bases its regulations on the Pharmacopoeia of the Peoples Republic of China, which latest edition was published in 2020. This pharmacopoeia includes information on Chinese fitoterapias, allopathic drugs, and relevant pharmacological data for the safe use of these medications. Despite its therapeutic potential, Chinese Herbal Medicine faces challenges such as limited access to the Chinese Pharmacopoeia, scarce researches on its application, and a lack of specialized training courses in Brazil. In this context, there emerges a need to implement a training and postgraduate course in Chinese Herbal Medicine, as well as establish a community clinic focused on prescribing Chinese Magistral Formulas and/or single Chinese Materia Medica, following TCM diagnostic and tratamento standards. This summary aims to report the initial experience of a Chinese Herbal Medicine clinic at a TCM educational institution in Brasília- DF and present preliminary results from patient follow-ups. To evaluate tratamento adherence and resultados, a qualitativo method was used through semi-structured interviews. These interviews begin during in-person consultations, which include filling out a medical history and conducting TCM diagnostic examinationssteps performed by regular students under the supervision of a qualified instructor. After the initial consultation, subsequent patient contacts occur weekly via phone, with in-person follow-ups during return visits. In July 2025, a new phase of the clinic began: clinical data colletion for future research. For this purpose, patients are presented with a Consentimento Informado Form (TCLE), following Brazils bioethics instructions, which authorizes (or not) the confidential use of their data. The clinic started in March 2025 and has already treated approximately 17 patients, who continue to be monitored. A tratamento adherence rate of 83% was recorded. Among the adherent patients, 100% reported some improvement in their initial complaints. New consultation dates are scheduled for the second half of 2025 to meet the demand of interested new patients. Although the number of consultations is still modest, the institutions goal is to gradually expand its services, maintaining a commitment to ethics and scientific rigor. Additionally, we seek to catalog data for scientific research purposes, intending to strengthen Chinese Herbal Medicine in Brazil and provide evidence of its efficacy.",

    "abstract": "The Unified Health System (SUS) established a paradigmatic transition in Brazil, expanding the concept of health and establishing the universal right to health, with the possibility of care that considers other rationalities to encompass the wholeness of the individual (SAMPAIO, 2019). A notable element in this process is the 2006 National Policy on Integrative and Complementary Health Practices (PNPIC), which encompasses 29 practices, including Biodance, incorporated in 2017 (BRASIL, 2008, 2017). Biodanza is defined by Toro (2002) as a system of human development and integration, promoting organic renewal, affective re-education, and the relearning of life's original functions, according to our basic instincts. Objective: This research sought to understand and analyze the conditions for implementing Biodanza in the context of PICS (National Health Program) in Brazil's Unified Health System (SUS), its potential, and its challenges. The main motivation was the scarcity of publications on the topic in saúde pública, making it pioneering and relevant for the scientific community, management, and training institutions. This is a qualitativo, exploratory, and descriptive study, approved by the UFPE Research Ethics Committee under No. 4962189. Data collection took place between September and November 2021, covering all of Brazil. The study subjects were Biodanza facilitators who were working or had worked in a SUS service since the inclusion of Biodanza in the PNPIC (National Health Program). The sample was recruited using the \"snowball sampling\" technique (VINUTO, 2014). Twenty-five Biodanza facilitators were interviewed through semi-structured online interviews. The collected data were subjected to content analysis (BARDIN, 2016). The study reveals an incipient implementation, with weaknesses in institutionalization (BARBOSA et al., 2020). Biodanza facilitators are responsible for its insertion, organization, expansion, maintenance, and even financing within the SUS (Unified Health System), similar to other PICS (BARRO, 2020). Although a practice present in saúde pública since the 1980s, it remains restricted to certain geographic areas (capitals and metropolitan regions). At the same time, it demonstrates contributions as a complementary therapeutic resource to biomedicine in resolving user problems or complaints. Primary Health Care was considered suitable for the implementation of Biodanza (MIRANDA, 2022) due to its characteristics; however, it is present at other levels of healthcare. The challenges identified were not barriers to implementation; progress in improving working conditions (connections, infrastructure, organization, protocols), territoriality, internalization, and universalization of Biodanza within the Unified Health System (SUS) deserves special mention. Biodanza training, like other PICS, fits into the privatized model of care, equidistant from the SUS context (NASCIMENTO, 2018). This suggests that training should include content related to the SUS, contributing to improved professional performance. Given the scarcity of publications on the subject of this study, it fulfilled the ethical and political objective of including Biodanza in the scientific evidence for PICS within the SUS. It also paves the way for new research and timely dialogue between management, academia, healthcare professionals, and Biodanza schools about the positive impacts Biodanza has had on the Unified Health System (SUS).",

The protocol of this revisão sistemática was registered at INPLASY (ID:202560064). An literature searching in 9 databases was conducted to 22th May 2025. Two authors extracted data and assessed the risk of bias independently. Statistical analysis was performed using RevMan 5.4.1 software (Cochrane Collaboration, London, UK). Meta-analysis with a random effect model was conducted when there was no serious statistical heterogeneity among trials (I² 75%). Grading of Recomendações Assessment, Development, and Evaluation was also conducted to assess the quality of evidence. Twenty-four trials with 3642 participants were included. All included trials were assessed as having high risk of bias.

And there was very low quality evidence that tenderness score, dysfunction score in the Cheezheng pain-relieving plasters groups were lower than that in the control groups. Although the heterogeneity between studies and the methodological quality of the study itself lead to the low evidence strength of the current conclusions, the results of this study are a valuable supplement to the founding of previous review. This study systematically evaluated its efficacy and segurança in the tratamento of knee osteoarthritis, lumbar muscle strain, soft tissue injury and cervical spondylosis. The results showed that: compared with a variety of topical Chinese patent drugs or western drugs (such as non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), Cheezheng pain-relieving plasters had outstanding performance in improving the overall efficiency, reducing visual analogue scale (VAS), improving joint function and alleviating joint disorders, especially in knee osteoarthritis and soft tissue injury. Cheezheng pain-relieving plasters, as an external traditional Chinese medicine preparation, has clear clinical value and good segurança in the tratamento of dor crônicaful diseases, and has the potential to be popularized and applied in clinical practice. Although the existing evidence preliminarily supports the clinical application value of Cheezheng pain-relieving plasters, there are still some problems such as small sample size, short follow-up time and lack of international multicenter data. Therefore, high-quality, large sample, long-term follow-up randomized controlled trials are still needed in the future to further verify its long-term efficacy and segurança.",

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is an emerging global saúde pública crisis estimated to be associated with 8.22 million deaths globally by 2050, rising 75% from 2021 (4.71 million). AMR threatens the efficacy of conventional antimicrobial therapies. Naturopathic modalities are known adjunctive therapies that could support standard medical care for this crisis. Yet the supporting evidence for naturopathic modalities to address AMR is dispersed with unknown gaps. Identifying these gaps will help fight AMR, inform policy, and direct traditional, complementary, and integrative medical (TCIM) research to produce rigorous research into AMR. To do this we report a comprehensive evidence map of human studies evaluating naturopathic intervençãos targeting AMR resultados in infectious diseases. Evidence maps visually harmonize research across regions and modalities which can hasten the adoption of global best practices and the alignment of regulatory standards. They allow international researchers, health agencies and practitioners to more easily collaborate and identify common gaps and weaknesses in the TCIM research. This project utilizes the six-step methodology outlined by Schveitzer et al. and applies the Preferred Reporting Items for Mapping Reviews (PRITEM) guideline for evidence mapping. The process begins with topic scoping and stakeholder engagement (involving policy experts, practitioners, and patient representatives) to frame research questions. The protocol is registered on the Open Science Framework (OSF). A systematic literature search is conducted across multiple databases (PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Alt Health Watch, Google Scholar, and PROSPERO). Article screening is performed independently and in duplicate using Rayyan, and a PRISMA flow diagram is recorded. Study metadata, intervenção details, resultados, and equity indicators are extracted into customized REDCap instruments with members of the World Naturopathic Federation Antimicrobial Resistance Committee. Study quality is appraised independently using AMSTAR 2 and MMAT tools. Extracted data are synthesized and visualized in interactive Tableau dashboards in collaboration with CABSIN/BIREME and PAHO. The evidence map will synthesize the clinical efetividade of naturopathic modalities - including fitoterapia, essential oils, clinical nutrition/nutraceuticals, probiotics, hydroterapia, applied nutrition/diet, exercise/movement, and acupunturain optimizing health resultados in infectious diseases and related immune function. Disease resultados covered include urinary tract infections, respiratory infections, skin infections, gastroenteritis, dysbiosis-related symptoms, and antimicrobial-associated diarrhea. To date, we have identified 200 revisão sistemáticas from PubMed, supplemented with additional primary studies as indicated by gaps in revisão sistemática coverage. Preliminary mapping reveals evidence clusters for fitoterapia, clinical nutrition, and probiotics in respiratory and gastrointestinal infections, alongside notable research gaps in lifestyle therapies, hydroterapia, and acupuntura for AMR-related resultados.The completed evidence map will visually display all identified human clinical studies on naturopathic approaches to AMR. This evidence map provides a transparent, replicable framework for mapping evidence on naturopathic intervençãos addressing AMR. By visually identifying evidence clusters and gaps, the project supports the integration of complementary and integrative intervençãos into AMR strategies, informs policymakers, and delineates research priorities for the international traditional complementary and integrative medicine community. The mapping process is designed to enhance global collaboration, improve research efficiency, and ultimately support evidence-informed decision-making in the context of planetary health.",

    "abstract": "There is a growing trend where Traditional Complementary and Integrative Medicines, dietary supplements, and even conventional foods are adulterated with hidden drugs and chemicals. These products are typically promoted for weight loss, sexual enhancement, and diabetes, and are often represented as being Natural. Consumers should exercise caution before purchasing any product in the above categories. The present study aims to investigate pharmaceutical analogue adulteration of nonprescription and prescription products in Traditional, Complementary, and Integrative Medicines, especially in Herbal Medicines and Dietary Supplements Alverine, Fluoxetine, Tripropylamine, Sibutramine hydrochloride , Atenolol , Ducolax , Hydroxyzine, Phosphodiesterase -5 inhibitors e.g., Sildenafil citrate, Thio- methiso sildenafil, Hydroxy homo Sildenafil; Tadalafil, Benzamidenafil, -Hydroxy ethyl nor tadalafil; Acetaminophen, Glucophage, All Sulphonylureas and required standards were received from the Sigma Aldrich and other recognized agencies. HPLC grade methanol was obtained from Merck, USA. High-purity water was prepared using a Waters Milli-Q plus purification system. Equipment: Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometer QP-2010 (GC-MS) analysis for all samples and standards was performed. Sample preparation: Approx. 1.0 mg of sample was weighed and mixed with 5.0 mL of methanol. The samples were ultrasonicated for 30.0 minutes and filtered using a 0.45 m membrane. The volume of the filtered supernatant was completed to 10.0 mL with methanol. Gas Chromatographic Mass Spectrometric (GC-MS) Studies: Different mobile phases were used to develop the thin layer chromatograms using petrol /acetone, methanol extracts. Compounds are identified in the sample taken in the above solvents and on comparison with reference standards through Chromatographic studies and Mass spectrometric analysis. Research analyses on quite a large number of fitoterapias and herbal medicinal products(HMPs), purchased from market and web sites, have been tested and unfortunately it has been found that the undeclared active pharmaceutical ingredients are present in almost all of these products and a couple of them contained more than one including either sibutramine (a controlled substance), alverine (a drug for functional gastrointestinal disorders), tripropyl amine (a laboratory chemical not advised for food, drug), atenolol (used with or without other medications to treat high blood pressure (hypertension).), Ducolax (a stimulant laxative drug), Glucopage, Glybenclamide, Tolbutamide and other sulphonyl ureas besides other plant ingredients. as mentioned in the ingredient list of the medicine. The tainted products will be described in detail, along with the undeclared drugs and/or chemical ingredients with their side effects, analyzed using chromatographic & mass spectrometric techniques. A final recommendation is given in each case for not using these medicines for saúde pública segurança. On the basis of above undeclared and banned chemicals found in Herbal Medicinal Products and supplementary products it is concluded that these are not at all safe to use .This paper also gives an overview of health-related risks after consuming such spurious products and challenges for future perspectives to control such type of malpractices.",

    "abstract": "Oral diseases contribute to chronic low-grade inflammation and systemic dissemination of microbial products, potentially influencing neurological and systemic health. Evidence highlights associations between periodontal disease, endodontic infections, necrotic teeth, and exposure to toxic metals (e.g., mercury in amalgams) with chronic inflammatory burden. This underscores the need for an integrative perspective that bridges conventional dentistry with complementary approaches in Traditional Chinese and Integrative Medicine (TCIM). A systematic search was conducted in PubMed/MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, and SciELO up to August 2025. Search terms combined descriptors related to oral infections (periodontitis, endodontic infection, necrotic teeth, mercury) and systemic/neurological resultados (systemic inflammation, neurodegeneration, autoimmune disease). Inclusion criteria: human studies reporting systemic biomarkers, neurological or systemic resultados associated with oral conditions. Exclusion criteria: relato de casos, in vitro or animal studies. Two reviewers independently screened titles/abstracts and full texts; data were extracted using a standardized form. From 612 records identified, 47 studies met the eligibility criteria. Most were observational cohorts or case-control studies, with six ensaio clínicos. Consistent evidence showed that oral infections were associated with elevated inflammatory biomarkers (CRP, IL-6, TNF-, fibrinogen). Several studies linked periodontitis and apical lesions to increased risk of cardiovascular disease, cognitive decline, and autoimmune disorders. Limited clinical evidence suggested that removal of infectious foci (e.g., extraction of necrotic teeth or surgical management of cavitations) was associated with symptom remission in selected patients. However, heterogeneity in methods and resultados precludes definitive conclusions. Current evidence indicates that chronic oral infections and exposure to toxic metals may contribute to systemic and neurological disorders through persistent inflammation. Integration of dental care with TCIM approachessuch as modulation of inflammatory pathways, support of immune balance, and patient-centered holistic assessmentmay enhance clinical resultados. Well-designed longitudinal studies are needed to clarify causal pathways and to support integrative strategies in patient management.",

    "abstract": "Integrative medicine recognizes the oral cavity as a critical point of systemic influence. Osteonecrotic cavitations of the jaw and maxillaoften asymptomaticare lesions described since the 1920s. When present, they may manifest as Cavitational Osteonecrosis-Induced Neuralgia (CON); however, even without pain, they constitute Fatty Degenerative Osteonecrosis of the Jaw (FDOJ), often associated with the proinflammatory chemokine CCL5. These cavitations result from trauma, infections, alendronates, anesthetics, and tooth extractions, and they remain difficult to detect via conventional radiographs. Functional tests, such as muscle response testing and energetic field analysis, have proven useful in identifying areas of circulatory compromise and chronic inflammation. These lesions predominantly affect women aged 40 to 60, particularly in the region of the third molars, and are associated with reduced blood flow, impaired regeneration, and persistent low-grade infections. Conventional surgical curettage alone often fails to fully resolve these conditions. An integrative therapeutic approach incorporating ozone terapia, high-power Er:YAG laser, and autologous platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) enhances vascularization, regeneration, and healing. Microcirculation plays a key role in cellular nutrition and detoxification, and its compromise impacts systemic physiology. Clinical evidence suggests that these cavitations contribute to systemic inflammatory, cardiovascular, neurological, autoimmune, and even neoplastic diseases. Coagulation abnormalities and hypofibrinolysis are also common among affected individuals. Clinical observations in four female patients with confirmed cavitations provided the first visual evidence of peripheral blood improvement following tratamento. Blood analysis revealed decreased rouleaux formation, reduced erythrocyte aggregation, and increased zeta potentialenhancing blood flow and tissue oxygenation. Additionally, post-tratamento reductions in inflammatory cytokines such as interleukins, immunoglobulins, and fibrinogen correlated with improved rheology, reduced viscosity, and vasodilation. These findings reinforce the concept that jawbone cavitations are not merely local issues but systemic disruptors. Their proper identification and integrative tratamento offer a powerful strategy for restoring biochemical and bioenergetic balancesupporting both oral and systemic health. This case series utilized clinical observation to assess an integrative therapeutic protocol for jawbone cavitations and their systemic effects in four female patients. Diagnosed via clinical history, advanced imaging, and functional tests, patients received ozone terapia, Er:YAG laser, and PRF. Pre- and post-tratamento, we observed improved peripheral blood flow, reduced rouleaux formation and erythrocyte aggregation, increased zeta potential, and decreased inflammatory cytokines. These findings suggest that jawbone cavitations are systemic disruptors and that an integrative approach beneficially impacts microcirculation and inflammatory markers, restoring biochemical and bioenergetic balance. Our clinical observations in four patients revealed improved microcirculation and reduced inflammatory cytokines post-integrative tratamento of jawbone cavitations. This indicates cavitations are systemic disruptors, and their proper tratamento is crucial for both oral and systemic balance. Our clinical observations in four patients highlight that jawbone cavitations are significant systemic disruptors, not merely isolated oral issues. The integrative tratamento of these cavitations, combining ozone, Er:YAG laser, and PRF, effectively improved microcirculation and reduced inflammatory cytokines. This demonstrates their crucial role in restoring both oral and broader systemic health. These findings underscore the vital need for a holistic dental-medical approach to patient care, emphasizing proper identification and integrative tratamento as a powerful strategy for overall well-being.",

    "abstract": "Culturally and regionally relevant physical activities (CRRPAs), such as ethnic dance and heritage sports and games, have strong value for promoção da saúde. However, evidence on CRRPA is dispersed across multiple scientific disciplines including anthropology, Indigenous studies, behavioral medicine, gerontology, and saúde pública. Furthermore, culturally specific terminology complicates identification of relevant literature through conventional search strategies, which are typically oriented toward Western biomedical frameworks. Aims are to develop and implement a comprehensive, tiered, expert- and AI-informed search strategy to synthesize evidence on CRRPA for global promoção da saúde. A scoping review framework is being employed to guide evidence synthesis. The search strategy is being designed in collaboration with global and saúde pública experts and library scientists with cultural and regional expertise. We are utilizing a tiered approach across two broad strategies: (i) generic terms relevant to CRRPA (e.g., physical activity, exercise) and (ii) specific activity-based search terms (e.g., hula, Tai Chi). Within the second strategy, multiple tiers are applied: Teir 1 incorporates broad terms related to different categories of activities including ethnic dance, martial arts, food acquisition, sports and games, and others. Tier 2 includes terms derived from preliminary review and study team expertise. Tier 3 draws from established resources (e.g. lists from UNESCO and Traditional Sports Organization). Tier 4 employs AI-generated search terms from SCOPUS AI and ChatGPT. Tier 5 integrates terms from reference librarians with regional and cultural expertise. Multiple databases will be searched to capture multidisciplinary evidence, including PubMed, CINAHL, Web of Science, EBSCOhost, PsycInfo, AnthroSource, SocIndex, ATLA Religion Database, Sports Medicine & Education Index, and SportDISCUS. Search terms are adapted using both Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and keywords. Grey literature sources will also be explored to capture community-based and non-indexed publications. Preliminary review has identified literature on a wide variety of CRRPAs across multiple disciplines. Practices such as yoga, Tai Chi, and Qigong have been well documented for their health benefits, particularly for mental wellbeing and chronic disease management. In contrast, other activities remain underrepresented or absent from indexed databases. Additionally, we expect that the research will be disproportionately skewed toward the Global North, with limited representation from Africa, Latin America, and parts of Asia. The iterative refinement of search terms, guided by expert input and AI tools, is expected to enhance identification of culturally specific terminology not captured by standard indexing systems. The development of this tiered, interdisciplinary search strategy offers a novel, inclusive approach to synthesizing evidence on CRRPA. By integrating cultural expertise, AI-assisted search term generation, and a structured methodology, this approach addresses linguistic challenges and disciplinary fragmentation in the literature. Anticipated resultados include identifying both well-studied and overlooked CRRPAs, highlighting gaps in the research, including underrepresented populations (e.g., refugees) and geographical disparities. This strategy also recognizes the importance of decolonial and postcolonial perspectives in categorizing and analyzing CRRPA across regions. Ultimately, this work aims to inform equitable, culturally relevant promoção da saúde strategies worldwide. Furthermore, this approach may serve as a model for evidence synthesis in other complex saúde pública domains.",

    "abstract": "Chronic pain is a growing saúde pública issue that affects millions of people worldwide. Its management poses a challenge for health systems, especially given the complexity of the factors that contribute to its chronicity and the need for safe, effective, and accessible therapeutic approaches. In this context, this research proposes the creation of a Care Pathway Protocol (CPP) that incorporates Traditional, Complementary, and Integrative Medicines (TCIM) in the care of patients with dor crônica, both in the active phase and in the prevenção of pain chronicity, in comprehensive care practices from atenção primária to more specialized levels. These practices are organized according to the needs and preferences of users, focusing on a person-centered approach, continuous care, and interprofessional collaboration, with the aim of providing an evidence-informed guide for healthcare professionals in assisting patients with dor crônica. The CPP is structured as a multimodal assistance model that promotes shared decision-making and organization of care processes for a defined group of patients with similar needs over a specified period, integrating conventional practices and integrative therapies, prioritizing non-pharmacological intervençãos and integrative and complementary practices. This is a methodological study based on a narrative review of the literature and analysis of national and international clinical guidelines, aiming to identify intervençãos with scientific support, applicable in the context of Brazilian saúde pública. This work aims to answer the question: 'What are the available assistance resources from TCIM for the prevenção and tratamento of dor crônica based on evidence'. The CPP was proposed from the perspective of clinical studies on the segurança and efetividade of integrative medicine intervençãos, considering different individual and collective care approaches, in a holistic manner to mitigate the progression of dor crônica and improve qualidade de vida. The results provide consistent evidence of the efetividade of Integrative and Complementary Practices in pain reduction, improvement of qualidade de vida, and promotion of well-being. The contribution of these practices to the reduction of the use of analgesics and opioids, prevenção of iatrogenic issues, and strengthening of patient autonomy in self-care was also identified. The CPP proposes educational actions and collective practices, expanding user participation and integrating the community dimension of care. The CPP has the potential to enhance the organization of services, rationalize resource use, and facilitate the implementation of more effective care pathways. It aligns with the guidelines of the National Policy on Integrative and Complementary Practices and can contribute to the institutionalization of TCIM as an integral part of strategies for promoção da saúde and prevenção of dor crônica in the Brazilian saúde pública. The integrative CPP represents a strategic tool for reorganizing care for dor crônica, promoting safe, sustainable, and baseado em evidence practices. Its adoption can strengthen the bond between teams and users, prevent the chronicity of pain, reduce healthcare costs, and improve clinical and human resultados. By recognizing the complexity of dor crônica and valuing the therapeutic diversity of Integrative Healthcare Practitioners, the CPP broadens the scope of care and reaffirms the commitment to a more comprehensive, welcoming, and effective health model.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: More than 80% of the global population uses TCIM and the World Health Organisation has initiated a strategy to encourage the growth of TCIM into mainstream healthcare models. It may be understood that with the growing developments of modern technology that accessing information on TCIM by stakeholders like patients, health providers, researchers and key decision makers; is more accessible. The barriers, limitations and use of the obtained information on TCIM as well as, how it is communicated and how it is used in practice amongst various stakeholders is, however, unclear. AIM: This literature review aims to understand the current landscape globally on the resources used for accessing information on TCIM and whether needs are met or unmet for people seeking information on TCIM. METHODS: A database search using CINAHL, Medline (Ovid), PubMed (Ovid), Scopus, and Amed, was undertaken to identify peer-reviewed original research articles published between 2010 through to September 2023. The search found 11 papers that met the selection criteria. RESULTS: Overall, the results indicated several interconnected elements. Participants feel overwhelmed with decisions about the use of TCIM and often found health providers are unable to help. Participants want more TCIM information and rely on non-preferred sources and non-evidenced-based sources when seeking information on TCIM. Some altered decision-making and changes to clinical practice were made after receiving evidenced-based information. The results found in this paper highlight deficiencies in the communication between patient and health provider, evidencing a culture of non-disclosure of TCIM amongst patients, with a varied exchange of information between stakeholders. Although some insights to participant barriers, limitations, impacts and uses were found; the level of knowledge of TCIM amongst health providers were mainly dependant on confidence levels; and consultation time, health literacy, and resource access showed an impact to patient responses at the point of clinical practice. More information is needed around TCIM use, knowledge and limitations at the health provider and patient level. CONCLUSION: Overall, very little is clear regarding the met and unmet needs of people looking to use TCIM. There may be a growing momentum of TCIM integration into modern health systems and understanding health providers and patient level interactions around TCIM use seems to be an area lacking in clarity despite being a necessary part of an integration strategy. More research is needed to improve the forward movement of integration and enhance the culture of communication, documentation, evaluation and advance healthcare systems among practitioner communities, on a global scale.",

    "abstract": "Integrative and Complementary Health Practices (PICS) are therapeutic approaches aimed at the prevenção of health disorders, as well as the promotion and restoration of health. These practices emphasize empathetic listening, the establishment of therapeutic bonds, and the interconnectedness between the patient, the environment, and society. The adoption of such practices has increased significantly in recent years. This growth is primarily attributed to the rising demand for healthcare services driven by the high prevalence of chronic diseases and the persistent inequities in access to health services, particularly in relation to cost, quality, and care models. To outline the sociodemographic and clinical profile of individuals with chronic diseases receiving care through PICS, in order to understand their clinical needs and to promote comprehensive care and empathetic listening through qualified, multidisciplinary assistance. This descriptive observational study, with both quantitative and qualitativo approaches, is part of the project 'Mapping the health conditions of the Black population in the state of Bahia' (CAAE 47433421.5.0000.5662). It was carried out at the Telemonitoring and PICS Outpatient Clinic of the Physical Therapy School Clinic, Multidisciplinary Institute of Rehabilitation and Health (IMRS), Federal University of Bahia (UFBA), in Salvador, Brazil. A total of 58 individuals with at least one chronic condition were enrolled, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, race, or ethnicity. Participants received weekly sessions of meditação, yoga, biodanza, and Reiki over a 90-day period. Data were collected using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-14), and the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale. Statistical analysis was performed using Jamovi software, with results expressed in frequencies, central tendency measures, and scores. Among the participants (n = 28), 92.3% (n = 24) were female, with a mean age of 54.2 ± 14.7 years; 96.1% self-identified as Black; 48% had completed secondary education; and 36% were salaried workers. Additionally, 48% presented with two or more comorbidities, the most prevalent being systemic arterial hypertension, obesity, and diabetes mellitus. Fibromyalgia was reported by 24% of the participants. Regarding stress levels (PSS-14 = 30.5 ± 4.88), 22 individuals reported high stress levels, and 23 reported high ansiedade levels (Hamilton = 25.5 ± 11.65). Poor sleep quality (Pittsburgh > 5) was reported by 14 participants. PICS have been increasingly recommended as strategies for promoção da saúde and stress reduction, offering clinically significant physical and psychological benefits for individuals living with chronic conditions.",

    "abstract": "Among Indigenous peoples of the Northeast, the encantados are spirits that dwell in rivers, forests, and human bodies, regarded as guardians of memory, knowledge, and collective identity. These entities are not perceived as myths or legends, but as real presences that teach and protect through oral tradition, rituals, songs, and dreams. In this context, spirituality and ancestry constitute legitimate forms of healthcare, as well as of knowledge production and transmission. This study aims to present the experience of the Lica Xukuru Memorial of Indigenous Medicine, an initiative that exemplifies the valorization of ancestral knowledge, the strengthening of health autonomy, and the articulation between Indigenous medical practices and conventional health systems. The development of this Indigenous medicine space is grounded in a qualitativo approach that combines research with practical field-based actions, such as workshops, discussion circles, and other activities carried out in the Xukuru do Ororubá territory, in the state of Pernambuco. The initiative is the result of a partnership between the Federal University of Pernambuco (UFPE) and the Xukuru do Ororubá Indigenous Health Council. The Memorial is currently being implemented, and its creation pays tribute to Pajé Lica Xukuru, who passed into ancestry in August 2020 due to Covid-19. It is conceived as a space dedicated to the preservation and transmission of Indigenous medical knowledge of the Xukuru do Ororubá people. The Memorial includes a medicinal plant garden and a circular covered area for the exhibition of Lica Xukurus memory. It also serves as a venue for dialogue on Indigenous medicine with the Indigenous Multidisciplinary Health Teams (EMSI), local care practitioners, and gives special attention to the future training of Xukuru youthreferred to as the \"seeds\" of the Xukuru do Ororubá. To document the use of practices involving homemade remedies, a total of 55 Indigenous knowledge holders and 85 professionals from the EMSI were brought together between 2022 and 2023. Their dialogues culminated in the production of the booklet Lica Xukuru Memorial of Indigenous Medicine: A Manual for the Use of Medicinal Plants, an important record of this peoples knowledge that will serve as educational support material for the Lica Xukuru Memorial. This experience contributes to the protection of traditional knowledge and to the development of intercultural and place-based public policies that respect the ways of life and knowledge systems of Indigenous peoples.",

    "abstract": "Healthcare workers are highly vulnerable to mental health disorders such as stress, ansiedade, depressão, and burnout, especially in post-pandemic contexts. In Brazil, 41.7% of health professionals reported symptoms related to depressão and ansiedade. Studies show a close relationship between dor crônica and psychological distress, which directly impacts work performance and qualidade de vida. Integrative and Complementary Practices in Health (PICS) have emerged as feasible, low-cost strategies within Primary Health Care (PHC) settings. This study aimed to describe the creation, implementation, and resultados of an integrative protocol focused on stress and dor crônica management for healthcare professionals in a Family Health Strategy unit. A retrospective, descriptive study was conducted in a PHC unit in Barretos, Brazil. The Integrated Health protocol combined three intervençãos: (1) Pranayama breathing exercises; (2) auricular acupuntura following the NADA protocol; and (3) cervical myofascial release massage. Sessions were performed weekly for four weeks, lasting 30 minutes each. Thirty-four professionals participated voluntarily. Data were collected via a Google Forms questionnaire before and after the intervenção, assessing sociodemographic data and self-perception of stress, pain, sleep, and well-being. Quantitative data were analyzed using Jamovi software; qualitativo data were reviewed through thematic content analysis of open responses. Among the 34 participants, 41% reported a reduction in stress, 27% in pain, 23% improvement in vitality, and 9% better sleep quality. Additionally, 62% stated feeling highly stressed at work before the intervenção. The qualitativo analysis revealed recurring terms like \"relief,\" \"calm,\" and \"well-being\" in participants' feedback. The integrative protocol was well accepted, with no efeitos adversos reported. These findings align with international evidence supporting the efetividade of the NADA protocol and integrative approaches in managing occupational stress and dor crônica. Although causality cannot be established due to the retrospective design, the consistent perception of benefits highlights the potential of integrating PICS into occupational health strategies within PHC services. The Integrated Health protocol demonstrated positive resultados in stress and pain reduction among healthcare workers in a atenção primária setting. These findings suggest that incorporating integrative practices is both feasible and effective, offering a low-cost, safe, and accessible alternative to support the well-being of health professionals. Further prospective studies, including randomized ensaio clínicos, are recommended to validate these resultados and support broader implementation in saúde pública services.",

    "abstract": "The rise of telework in both the Brazilian and global contextsparticularly during and after the COVID-19 pandemichas reshaped concerns regarding occupational health. However, existing health policies have not adequately addressed the impacts associated with this work arrangement, especially in terms of physical, psychosocial, and emotional challenges. This study critically examines how the medical rationality of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), as endorsed by the World Health Organizations strategies for Traditional, Complementary, and Integrative Medicine (TCIM), can contribute to the formulation of health policies tailored to teleworkers. The research focuses on a case study conducted within a Brazilian federal educational institution, the Instituto Federal do Paraná (IFPR). This is a mixed-methods study that combines a descriptive quantitative approach with an exploratory qualitativo design. Data will be collected through structured questionnaires developed by the researchers, based on previous studies on the psychosocial and physical impacts of telework. The target population consists of technical-administrative staff at the IFPR who are engaged in telework. Ethics committee approval is currently in progress. Concurrently, an integrative literature review will be conducted to explore the connections between TCM and saúde pública policies, following PRISMA guidelines and incorporating a critical analysis of qualitativo data. Guided by these findings, the study will propose an institutional política de saúde structured according to the public policy cycle frameworkusing the survey results to define the policy agenda and the literature review to guide policy formulation. Preliminary findings suggest that teleworkers may be exposed to significant health risks, including extended working hours, emotional strain, technological overload, ergonomic issues, and psychosocial strains. Although still incipient, the literature indicates that principles of TCMsuch as emotional balance, self-care, preventive bodymind practices, and integrality in healthcan be integrated into occupational health programs to promote workplace segurança and well-being. This research is expected to generate both theoretical and practical contributions for the development of health policies aligned with the realities of telework. Grounded in TCM principles, the proposed policy framework aims to support integrative institutional actions that promote the well-being of public servants in remote work settings. Ultimately, these findings may inform not only internal policy development but also broader debates on saúde pública, integrative care, and the promotion of worker well-being in the context of evolving labor arrangements.",

    "abstract": "Insomnia is a common and debilitating health problem, and its usual terapia involves the use of sedative-hypnotic drugs, whose prolonged use often leads to significant health damage. Ayurveda, a traditional Indian system of medicine recognized by both the World Health Organization and Brazil as an integrative and complementary practice, holds extensive knowledge in treating insomnia using medicinal plants. Although there is no exact correspondence between the signs and symptoms described in Ayurveda and those in contemporary medicine, terms such as Anidra and Nidranasha are considered analogous to insomnia, with their etiology and therapeutic tratamentos well described. This study aimed to identify plant species with therapeutic potential for the tratamento of insomnia that occur in Brazil. The research methodology was based on a detailed literature review of the Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia of India, with the goal of identifying monographs of plant species indicated for Anidra/Nidranasha (insomnia). The vernacular names cited were transcribed, and the corresponding scientific names were confirmed using the Plants of the World Online (POWO) platform. The occurrence of these species in Brazil was verified through the databases of Flora e Funga do Brasil, POWO, SpeciesLink, and Dataplamt. For the selected monographs, information regarding the plant part used and pharmaceutical form was collected. The Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia of India comprises 10 volumes, which include a total of 665 monographs. Considering explicit indications for Anidra/Nidranasha, seven plant species were identified, distributed across volumes I, III, IV, and V: Cannabis sativa L. (Part used: leaf  Pharmaceutical form: powder), Cucumis sativus L. (Part used: seed  Pharmaceutical form: powder), Dicliptera paniculata (Forssk.) I.Darbysh (Part used: root  Pharmaceutical form: powder), Elaeocarpus angustifolius Blume (Part used: seed  Pharmaceutical form: not available), Hyoscyamus niger L. (Part used: seed  Pharmaceutical form: not available), Nardostachys jatamansi (D.Don) DC. (Part used: rhizome  Pharmaceutical form: powder | decoction) and Rauvolfia serpentina (L.) Benth. ex Kurz (Part used: dried aerial root  Pharmaceutical form: not available). Among these, four species occur in Brazil (Cannabis sativa L.; Cucumis sativus L.; Hyoscyamus niger L.; Rauvolfia serpentina (L.) Benth. ex Kurz), and none are indicated for insomnia in the complementary documents of the Brazilian Pharmacopoeia: the Formulário de Fitoterápicos and the Memento de Fitoterápicos. Although two species do not have the pharmaceutical form described, the plant parts used are specified, and thus these findings may serve as a strategic tool for bioprospecting and the development of pharmacological studies aimed at validating their therapeutic potential. However, an important aspect to consider when evaluating pharmacological effects is the pharmacotechnics used in the preparation of Ayurvedic medicines, as there are significant differences in pharmaceutical practices between Brazil and India. Conducting studies that evaluate parameters related to efficacy and segurança is crucial for the integration of medicinal plants, promoted by innovation grounded in traditional knowledge.",

    "abstract": "The main objective of this study was to understand the therapeutic practices of Candomblé, a type of religion with an african original in Brazil, reflecting on the consideration of the relationship between body/mind/orixá (divinity), structured in the sacred, using different elements, material and immaterial, and spaces in the broader society, serving a heterogeneous clientele of followers and non-followers of this religion and its advances to legitimize itself as a religious medicine. We sought, through ethnography, to explore dimensions of the therapeutic experience: (1) Narrative about the symptom and the initial experience of illness organized based on the contiguity of events; (2) Prototypes related to health problems based on the interviewee's previous experience, focusing on similarities, differences and the description of the problem individuation process; (3) Explanatory models, causal attributions, expectations regarding tratamento, course and prognosis. (4) Services (institutions, places of care, etc.) and response to the tratamento obtained therein; (5) Impact on life: this includes aspects related to values, the vicissitudes of living with the health problem in question. The existence of adherents and non-followers who seek, in this African-based religion, to solve health problems leads us to consider it as a complex medical system. Among the intervenção actions of this \"medicine\" can be found approaches that seek to trigger natural and supernatural mechanisms of promoção da saúde, privileging welcoming, the therapeutic bond and the subject's interaction with nature, enabling a holistic view of the health-disease process. Thus, \"medicine\", conceived by Candomblé, stands as an important option in the face of healthcare needs despite the primacy of the \"official health system\" and the marginal situation, whose association dates back to the historical process of religion. What becomes fascinating about this social manifestation is the primary importance that vegetables occupy in the worldview of the group in question. We believe this Project has contributed positively to understanding issues related to therapeutic practices in Candomblé, whose specificity lies in a particular modality and a worldview capable of accounting for the different processes within which health and disease phenomena are embedded. We reaffirm the importance of the Unified Health System (SUS) as a saúde pública system, sensitive to \"religious medicines\" and establishing institutional partnerships aimed at aggregating knowledge and expertise for promoção da saúde and reinforcing the importance of phytoterapia from this religious system in the saúde pública system in Brazil.",

    "abstract": "With a yearly conversion rate of 5% to 10%, Pre Diabetes (intermediate hyperglycemia), defined as glycemic parameters above normal but below diabetes thresholds, is a high-risk state for diabetes and CVD. The mainstay of diabetes prevenção for prediabetic people is lifestyle modification, which has been shown to reduce relative risk by 40% to 70%. The advantage of using medication is also recommended. No study has explored the role of Nisha Amalaki powder and Yoga practice as combined terapia for prediabetes.This study aims to explore whether intervenção with Nisha Amalaki powder and Yoga could revert prediabetes to normal glycaemic status as the primary resultado. A randomized controlled trial of Ayurvedic formulation Nisha Amalaki powder and Yoga for 12 weeks was conducted in Sir Sunder Lal hospital BHU. Total 74 diagnosed participants of Pre Diabetes with FBS 100-125 mg/dL were randomized into three groups( Nisha Amalaki powder and Yoga/ Nisha Amalaki powder/ Yoga). The Nisha Amalaki powder is a classical preparation that has mixture of turmeric and Indian gooseberry in equal ratio given in doses of 4 gm morning and evening with luke warm water. Yoga practice was administered as 1 hour online/offline session including joint movements , Asanas, Pranayamas and relaxation The individual undergoing the trial showed improvement in blood sugar valves. The combined terapia of Nisha Amalaki powder and Yoga practice had superior improvement in fasting and post prandial blood sugar levels, HbA1c values, body mass index, cholesterol, and triglyceride levels compared to those receiving either Nisha Amalaki powder or Yoga practice alone. The formulation Nisha Amalaki powder shows the effect by various mechanisms as increasing insulin sensitivity and glucose uptake by skeletal muscles, adipocytes inhibition of gluconeogenesis and decreasing oxidative stress. The diverse postures in yoga practice enhance the sensitivity of -cells to glucose, so augmenting insulin secretion. The joint movements along with postures increase blood flow to the muscles while promoting muscle relaxation, thereby facilitating improved glucose uptake. Parasympathetic activation and the associated anti-stress mechanisms of relaxation and Pranayam improve patients' overall metabolic and psychological profiles, in individuals with prediabetes. The combination of Nisha Amalaki powder with Yoga as mind body terapia further improves the effect in prediabetes. Nishamalaki and Yoga practice alone are promising intervençãos for the management of prediabetes. The combination of both intervençãos has shown even greater efficacy in reducing blood glucose and trigyceride levels and producing notable positive clinical resultados. This study paves the way for large multicentric studies for the management of prediabetes and the prevenção of diabetes in its early stages.",

    "abstract": "Insomnia is a prevalent condition defined by difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep, associated with daytime impairments such as fatigue, mood disturbances, and cognitive deficits. It poses a significant saúde pública challenge, often co-occurring with poor mental health. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of an 8-week Shabad Kriya meditação practice compared to an active control (relaxing reading) on insomnia severity, mental health, and qualidade de vida resultados. A randomized ensaio clínico was conducted, approved by the UFMG Ethics Committee (COEP-UFMG: 60582522.5.0000.5149). From 1,262 screened individuals, 174 participants were randomized into a Meditation group (MG) or a Relaxing Reading control group (RG), with 87 in each. Participants with severe neurological, psychiatric, or clinical disorders, or those using insomnia medication, were excluded. Interventions were performed daily before sleep for 8 weeks. Outcomes were assessed at baseline (T0), post-intervenção (T1), and at a 30-day follow-up (T2) using the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21), the World Health Organization Quality of Life-BREF (WHOQOL-BREF), and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). Data were analyzed using Wilcoxon and Mann-Whitney tests. While both intervençãos improved insomnia severity from baseline, the MG demonstrated significantly greater improvement at the 30-day follow-up (T2) compared to the RG (p=0.038). This long-term benefit was underscored by clinical remission rates (ISI<8) in the MG, which increased from 26.31% at T1 to 28.07% at T2. The MG also showed significantly greater reductions in stress (DASS-21) at T1 (p=0.032) and T2 (p=0.01), and superior resultados for depressão (p=0.046) and environmental qualidade de vida (p=0.037) at the T2 follow-up. Both intervençãos were equally effective in reducing immediate insomnia severity (T1), ansiedade, and overall perceived stress. These findings align with robust published RCTs describing Kundalini Yoga's efficacy. Our results particularly highlight the delayed superiority of Shabad Kriya for insomnia and depressão, suggesting it may foster deeper, more adaptive neurobiological changes than simple relaxation, a mechanism warranting further investigation. Shabad Kriya meditação is an effective intervenção, superior to relaxing reading for the long-term reduction of insomnia severity. It also confers sustained benefits for stress and long-term improvements in depressão and environmental qualidade de vida. Shabad Kriya represents a viable, evidence-informed TCIM strategy for addressing insomnia and its associated mental health comorbidities in the context of global saúde pública.",

    "abstract": "Osteopathic manipulative tratamento (OMT), including its manipulative maneuvers and cranial osteopathic techniques, has been investigated as a therapeutic approach for the management of dor crônica and symptoms associated with temporomandibular dysfunction (TMD) and dental clenching. Dental parafunction, acting as a precipitating factor for orofacial muscle dysfunction, often represents a significant etiological component of masticatory pain and dysfunction. The musculoskeletal system, particularly soft tissues, exhibits viscoelastic properties that allow for functional adaptation and structural reorganization in response to stressors such as dental clenching, aiming to maintain the biomechanical balance of the stomatognathic system. The osteopathic Mandibular Lift technique is proposed as a means for articular decompression of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ), pain relief, and improvement of masticatory function. This prospective, quantitative, experimental study investigated the effects of the osteopathic Mandibular Lift maneuver in 11 women aged 18 to 30 years. The participants were diagnosed with myogenic temporomandibular dysfunction and self-reported concentric clenching dental parafunction. Inclusion was based on the DC/TMD diagnostic criteria Axis I and Axis II Self-Reported Oral Behaviors Checklist) at the Oral Motricity Outpatient Clinic, CEPRE  Rehabilitation Research Center, UNICAMP. Electromyographic (EMG) signals and pressure algometry were collected from the right and left masseter, temporalis, and suprahyoid muscles. Data were acquired at three time points: pre-intervenção (T0), immediate post-intervenção (T1), and 60 days post-intervenção (T60). Measurements were performed using a Myosystem-BR1® electromyograph and software (DataHominis Tecnologia Ltda) and a pressure algometer (MedDor®). The osteopathic technique was performed by a certified osteopathic researcher (DO MROBr). This was a single-arm study. The study protocol was approved by the Research Ethics Committee (CEP)/UNICAMP (Resolution 466/12, Opinion No. 5.963.621/2023). Friedman's test indicated a significant effect of time (² = 8.91; df = 2; p = 0.012) on the RMS levels of this muscle. Post-hoc analysis revealed significant differences in comparisons between T0 vs. T2 (p = 0.003) and between T2 and T60 (p = 0.009). No significant differences were found in the analysis of the left temporalis muscle and other muscles analyzed (p > 0.05). A positive correlation was found for the RMS of the right temporalis muscle between T0 and T60 (rho = 0.65; p = 0.037) and T2 and T60 (rho = 0.69; p = 0.023). A positive correlation was observed for the RMS of the left temporalis muscle between T0 and T60 (rho = 0.68; p = 0.025) and for the RMS of the right masseter muscle between T0 and T2 (rho = 0.65; p = 0.037), T0 and T60 (rho = 0.80; p < 0.001), and between T2 and T60 (rho = 0.72; p = 0.017). The RMS of the left masseter muscle showed a positive correlation only between T2 and T60 (rho = 0.67; p = 0.026). Mandibular Lift can descrease the right temporalis muscle electrical activity displayed significant changes over time, with notable differences evident between measured points. Other muscles, like the left temporalis and masseters, didn't exhibit the same marked temporal effects, but several positive correlations in electrical activity were observed across various time points",

    "abstract": "Cuba has a long history in the use of therapies that are now included within the concept of Natural and Traditional Medicine (NTM), even from the pre-Columbian and colonial ages. In 1997 the National Program for the Development and Generalization of Natural and Traditional Medicine was adopted, after several efforts starting in 1991. A review of the NMT's political, legal and regulatory framework was carried out. The main indicators related to this health program at the end of 2024 were also reviewed. Cuba recognizes Natural and Traditional Medicine as a medical specialty, with a holistic and integrative approach to health problems using methods of promoção da saúde, disease prevenção, diagnosis, tratamento and rehabilitation which come from traditional medical systems and other therapeutic modalities that are integrated with each other and with conventional tratamentos from modern Western Medicine. NTM includes Acupuncture, Phytoterapia, Apiterapia, Homeopathy, Flower Therapy, Ozone Therapy, Traditional Exercises, Medical Hydrology, Sun-Thalassoterapia, Natural Nutrition and more recently Ayurveda. There is a political, legal and regulatory framework for the development of NTM in the country. Today an Agreement from the Council of Ministers, as well as several resolutions from the Ministry of Public Health and regulations from the Center for the State Control of Medicines, Equipments and Medical Devices (CECMED, for its Spanish acronym) support the development of NTM in the National Health System (NHS). Also, the Public Health Act is currently being updated, and it incorporates elements related to NTM given its growing importance. By the end of 2024 the Cuban Basic List of Natural Products included 179 items, with a global production of 102.713.745 units of these products. NTM tratamentos were integrated at the three levels of the NHS for 61.304.218 patients, 81.5% of them at the atenção primária level. Medical education is guaranteed with different training programs, including a residency for Medical Doctors, with 175 residents and 376 doctors specialized in NTM by the end of 2024 in Cuba. The Ministry of Public Health's NTM Department, in conjunction with the Central Pharmacology Laboratory of the Havana Medical University, coordinates a Sectoral Program for Research in Natural and Traditional Medicine. The program has accepted 56 research projects until 2024, most of them related to medicinal plants and natural products. Taking all these elements into account, it is possible to say that the Cuban NHS ensure the conditions to facilitate the development of NTM.",

    "abstract": "Music is widely recognized as an accessible, non-invasive therapeutic tool for improving mental and emotional health. While 440 Hz is the international standard for musical tuning, an alternative frequency of 432 Hz has gained attention for its purported relaxing effects and potential health benefits. This revisão sistemática aims to evaluate and compare the evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the effects of music tuned to 432 Hz and 440 Hz on mental health resultados. A revisão sistemática of the literature was performed across seven databases. The initial search yielded 3,805 articles (Scopus: 1,621; PubMed/MEDLINE: 882; Embase: 572; Web of Science: 437; PsycINFO: 229; BVS/LILACS: 41; Cochrane: 23). After removing 1,349 duplicates, 2,456 unique records were screened. Inclusion criteria focused on RCTs that evaluated music at 432 Hz and/or 440 Hz for psychological and symptom resultados in populations with mental health conditions. Four RCTs met the full eligibility criteria and were included in the final analysis. The methodological quality of these studies was assessed using the Jadad scale. The included studies generally demonstrated a low risk of bias, with an average Jadad score of four out of five. Overall, all four RCTs reported positive and significant effects of music intervençãos on mental health symptoms, particularly in reducing ansiedade and stress. The studies that directly compared frequencies found that music tuned to 432 Hz was significantly more effective than 440 Hz in lowering ansiedade and physiological stress markers, such as salivary cortisol. Additional benefits associated with 432 Hz music included improvements in vital signs (e.g., respiratory rate and systolic blood pressure) and self-reported productivity. While these findings are promising, the current evidence is limited by the small number of studies, which are predominantly focused on situational ansiedade in the context of dental procedures. Music tuned to 432 Hz shows potential as a therapeutic resource, demonstrating superior effects compared to the standard 440 Hz tuning in managing ansiedade and physiological stress responses in the available evidence. This review highlights the promise of 432 Hz music as an accessible and cost-effective intervenção for emotional and psychological support. However, the scarcity of robust studies underscores the critical need for more rigorous, large-scale RCTs across diverse populations to validate these findings and establish definitive clinical guidelines.",

    "abstract": "Heart failure is commonly associated with reduced heart rate variability (HRV), primarily due to increased sympathetic activity and vagal withdrawal. This reduction is linked to increased mortality in both dilated and ischemic cardiomyopathy. However, HRV patterns, respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), and HRV biofeedback (HRV-Bfb) have not been thoroughly studied in patients with left ventricular assist devices (LVADs). We therefore conducted a feasibility pilot study in 11 patients with LVADs to analyze HRV under standardized conditions. Additionally we were interested in the influence of breathing patterns on the pulsatility of the pulsewave (earlobe). Eleven LVAD outpatients underwent HRV assessment under standardized conditions using the HRV-Scanner system (Biosign, Germany). The protocol included three phases: 1. One-minute RSA at six breaths per minute using a visual pacer, 2. Five-minute resting HRV, 3. Three-minute HRV-Bfb session with guided deep breathing. Time domain analysis (TDA) involved SDNN and RMSSD measurements across all phases. Frequency domain analysis (FDA) was applied during resting HRV and included high-frequency (HF), low-frequency (LF) power, and LF/HF ratio. The patients (mean age 57; 10 male) mostly had non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (NIDCM, n=8), with one DCM and two ICM cases. Ten had pacemakers. The following additional data are shown as mean and standard deviations (SD): BMI: 30 (7), Sys BP: 96 (15), Dia BP: 70 (14); Heart rate: 75/min (10); LVEDD: 6.7 (1.3); RVEDD: 3.1 (0.3); EF: 21 (9); LVAD Speed: 9276 (452); LVAD Flow: 5.3 (0.9); LVADPI: 6.3 (1.2); LVAD Wattage: 5.6 (1.3). TDA for condition 1-3: SDNN: 19.3 (10); 17.5 (10.4); 20.6 (13.0) and RMSSD: 11.8 (3.2); 15.1 (7.3); 16.7 (8.7). FDA for condition 2: HF: 15.5 (11.0); LF: 13.0 (10.1), LF/HF Quotient: 1.0 (0.6). Deep breathing influenced the pulse wave signal in 8/10 patients (condition 3). Four patients had too many extrasystoles to analyze HRV. LVAD patients exhibit reduced HRV, but HRV-Bfb and deep breathing may enhance SDNN and influence pulse wave patterns. These early results support further investigation into the role of HRV-Bfb and respiratory training in this patient group.",

    "abstract": "The ongoing conflict in Israel has adversely affected the wellbeing of oncology patients receiving tratamento. This study evaluated the impact of an integrative oncology (IO) intervenção on autonomic nervous system activity, using heart rate variability (HRV) as a biomarker. In this prospective, randomized, controlled, and pragmatic trial, oncology and/or palliative care patients were assessed for cancer- and war-related qualidade de vida (QoL) effects. Participants were randomized to receive a 30-minute manual-relaxation session either with (Group A) or without acupuntura (Group B). HRV and heart rate were monitored in 3-minute intervals, spanning from pre-tratamento to 15 minutes post-tratamento. Frequency-domain HRV parameterssuch as Power Total, Power HF, Power LF, and Power VLFwere analyzed between the groups. Time-domain metrics included RMSSD and SDNN. Of 125 enrolled participants, 91 had high-quality HRV data (Group A: 53; Group B: 38). Heart rate significantly declined in both groups, with a more notable reduction in Group B (p=0.005). LN Power Total decreased more in Group A (p=0.006), predominantly through reductions in LN Power LF (p=0.02) and LN Power VLF (p=0.026), along with a significant rise in Relative Power HF (p=0.009). No significant differences emerged in time-domain parameters. Patients undergoing oncology care during wartime exhibited a reduction in heart rate, indicative of heightened parasympathetic activity. The addition of acupuntura to manual-relaxation terapia was associated with HRV changes suggestive of reduced sympathetic activity. Additional studies are warranted to explore the effects of this combined approach in other oncological care environments.",

    "abstract": "Women's health at 40 years of age and older during the climacteric stage has increasingly become a focus of interest due to the growing possibilities for physical, mental, and psychological well-being. Various symptoms begin to manifest as a result of the decline in estrogen and progesterone levels, leading to a clinical picture marked by complexities that affect qualidade de vida on multiple levels. These include infertility and low libido; female sexual dysfunction caused by antidepressant medications; sexual desire disorder or hypoactive sexual desire; joint pain, hot flashes, insomnia, ansiedade, and night sweats, among others. Peruvian Maca (Lepidium meyenii) has been one of the most widely used plants in addressing the needs of this population, with growing interest in its potential as a dietary supplement and for its medicinal properties. Objective: This study aimed to analyze the therapeutic effects of Peruvian Maca (Lepidium meyenii) in women aged 40 and over, focusing on climacteric symptoms. The method implemented was a revisão sistemática conducted following PRISMA guidelines using the PubMed, Virtual Health Library (BVS), and EMBASE databases. A total of 56 studies were identified, of which 7 articles were selected that covered different scenarios where Peruvian Maca benefits women's health during the climacteric stage. Among these studies:  One reported the use of antidepressants in postmenopausal women and the positive response of Maca in improving sexual function and alleviating symptoms such as depressão and ansiedade;  One highlighted the reduction of psychological symptoms during menopause, while noting that Maca does not exert estrogenic effects;  Three studies confirmed the reduction of physiological discomforts associated with menopause and improvements in bone density markers;  One addressed improvements in joint pain;  And one emphasized that Maca root may help alleviate social ansiedade disorders as women age. The use of Peruvian Maca (Lepidium meyenii) may represent a promising and valuable option for women aged 40 and over in managing climacteric symptoms.",

    "abstract": "Planetary health highlights the interdependence between human well-being and the natural systems that sustain life. Despite its growing importance, medical education still lacks systematic integration of this topic. Medical educators must be prepared to address planetary health in teaching and practice. This study aimed to evaluate baseline knowledge in awareness of planetary health among medical educators following an interactive educational intervenção. An interactive workshop was conducted with medical school faculty, including a lecture entitled Planetary Health, the Climate Crisis, and Its Repercussions on Health. Participants completed pre- and post-intervenção questionnaires. The McNemar test was used to assess changes in categorical responses, and internal consistency was measured using Cronbachs alpha. Among participants, 50% had previously heard the term Planetary Health, and only one (6.25%) had attended an event on the topic. Cronbachs alpha was 0.81, indicating good reliability. Before the session, 43.75% reported understanding the concept of planetary health, 12.5% felt able to identify its relevance in medical education, 37.5% reported knowledge of climate change, 50% of air pollution, and 56.25% of social determinants of health. After the workshop, these percentages increased to 75% (p=0.007), 75% (p=0.0005), 87.5% (p=0.07), 87.5% (p=0.2), and 87.5% (p=0.0008), respectively. The interactive workshop significantly improved participants' awareness of planetary health and its relevance to medical education. This approach is an effective strategy for sensitizing educators and promoting curricular integration of planetary health.",

    "abstract": "In 2025, the Brazilian Academic Consortium for Integrative Health (CABSIN), in collaboration with WHO India and the Latin American and Caribbean Center on Health Sciences Information (BIREME/PAHO/WHO), developed the Ayurveda and Yoga Evidence Maps. This study is part of a set of Evidence Maps on Traditional Medicines, aimed at promoting evidence-informed policies. Studies were identified in the principal databases (PubMed, the VHL Regional Portal, and Embase) up to 2024 and selection was indepnedently realized by blinded revieweres at Rayyan. Redcap was used to extract data by trained reviewers. Methodological quality was assessed using the AMSTAR 2 tool, with discrepancies resolved by consensus. These Evidence Maps provide comprehensive overviews of clinical evidence supporting the use of Ayurveda and Yoga in healthcare. In the Ayurveda Evidence Map, 172 studies were screened for eligibility, with 78 included in the final map. From these: nine categories of health resultados were identified. In the Yoga Evidence Map, 317 studies were included, with confidence levels assessed. From these, Outcomes were classified into seven groups. These Maps reveal significant insights into their impact across various health conditions, particularly concerning metabolic health, mental well-being, cognitive performance, pain management. Regarding metabolic syndrome, both Ayurveda and Yoga show promising results. In Ayurveda research, cardiovascular and metabolic disorders constituted a substantial 35.5% of the health resultados studied, indicating a strong focus on these conditions and demonstrating positive effects. Similarly, for Yoga, metabolic and physiological indicators represented 25.6% of resultados, with nutritional, metabolic, and lymphatic diseases making up an additional 2.5%, showcasing Yoga's positive and potentially positive influence on metabolic markers. Specifically for diabetes mellitus, both maps consistently show that it's a well-studied condition, with both Ayurveda and Yoga demonstrating positive effects. Mental health is prominent area of research for both both disciplines. Ayurveda studies on mental health resultados represented 21.8% of the total, suggesting its application in addressing various mental health conditions. Yoga's impact on mental disorders is even more pronounced, accounting for 27.0% of resultados, with studies showing positive effects on conditions like schizophrenia. Closely related to mental health is cognitive performance. Overall, the evidence maps give positive results, reinforcing its efetividade. Both Ayurveda and Yoga demonstrate significant potential in addressing the specified health conditions. The evidence maps highlight the therapeutic benefits of these practices, particularly in metabolic disorders, mental health, and pain management. These findings strongly encourage the use of yoga and Ayurvedic products/formulations for children and adolescents. However, there is a need for more high-quality research, especially in Ayurveda, to further validate these findings. The comprehensive data provided by these maps can contribute to the integration of Ayurveda and Yoga into mainstream healthcare. In conclusion, the Ayurveda Evidence Map and the Yoga Evidence Map offer valuable insights into the clinical applications of these traditional healthcare systems. For a more detailed understanding of the methodologies, specific intervençãos, and comprehensive results, the full reports of both the Ayurveda Evidence Map and the Yoga Evidence Map are accessible on the Virtual Health Library of Traditional, Complementary, and Integrative Medicines website: https://mtci.bvsalud.org/pt/mapas-de-evidencia-2/",

    "abstract": "The Pan-American Compendium of Medicinal Plants is a collaborative initiative across the Americas launched in 2023 to address the longstanding absence of an inter-American unified pharmacopoeia. While countries such as China and India have long-established national pharmacopoeias to support the documentation, regulation, and economic development of their medicinal plant resources, the Americas have yet to consolidate their rich ethnobotanical traditions into a coordinated reference system. This abstract presents the Caribbean islands contribution to this effort, drawing on data and methodology from TRAMIL (Traditional Medicines in the Islands), a well-established program that has documented and scientifically evaluated medicinal plant use across the Caribbean Basin for over four decades. This review was undertaken in response to the conference organizers request to identify Caribbean native species for which some level of evidence from human studies is available. TRAMIL employs a ten-step methodology encompassing community-based identification of health priorities, statistically representative ethnopharmacological surveys, botanical authentication, critical literature review, and original pharmacological or toxicological studies when needed. This process results in classification of uses as [SIG] (significant use), [REC] (recommended use), or [TOX] (toxic use). For this review, all [SIG] native species reported in 19 island territories were reviewed, and a structured PubMed search was conducted to identify peer-reviewed human studies. Filters included randomized ensaio clínicos, ensaio clínicos, observational studies, and relato de casos involving humans. Species were classified based on native distribution as follows: native to both Caribbean island(s) and bordering continental countries (N); native exclusively to continental countries surveyed that border the Caribbean Sea (NEC); native exclusively to the Caribbean island territories surveyed (NEI). While NEC species are included for context, this review focuses on species from Caribbean island territories (N and NEI). TRAMIL surveys across both island and continental territories have identified 273 [SIG] medicinal plant species, of which 167 are native. Among these, 36 native species were found to have at least one peer-reviewed human-use study. Eighteen of these are native to both Caribbean islands and continental countries bordering the Caribbean Sea (N), occurring in at least one of the island territories surveyed. One species is native exclusively to the islands (NEI). The five species with the greatest number of published human studies are Phyllanthus amarus (14 studies), Phyllanthus niruri (8), Capsicum frutescens (6), Bidens pilosa (5), and Senna alata (5). These results underscore the high research and therapeutic potential of several culturally important species and justify their potential prioritization for detailed Pan-American monograph development. TRAMILs systematic, territory-based approach offers a tested model for integrating traditional knowledge with biomedical evidence. The contribution from the Caribbean islands is a foundational part of the first volume of the Pan-American Compendium and illustrates the importance of documenting, validating, and elevating native species across the Americas. In the absence of a unified pharmacopeia for the Pan-American region, this initiative marks a critical step toward building inclusive, baseado em evidence TCIM policy and unlocking the health and economic potential of its diverse medicinal flora.",

    "abstract": "Mental health among university students is a significant saúde pública concern, as this demographic is at a higher risk for depressão, ansiedade, and stress due to major lifestyle changes and new acadêmico and cognitive demands. As students grapple with existential questions about life, purpose, and the future, many seek support for the psychological distress that can accompany this period. Biblioterapia, a complementary terapia involving the guided reading of selected materials, has emerged as a promising intervenção. This scoping review aims to map the existing literature on the use of biblioterapia to improve the mental health of university students. A scoping review was conducted across seven health science databases: MEDLINE/PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, LILACS/BVS, Scopus, Web of Science, and PsycInfo. The search strategy used keywords related to \"Biblioterapia\" and \"University Students\". The initial search yielded 2,661 references (PubMed: 597; Embase: 764; Scopus: 651; Web of Science: 323; PsycInfo: 200; LILACS/BVS: 67; Cochrane: 1). After screening for duplicates and relevance, 50 articles were selected for full-text review. Preliminary results from the ongoing review highlight several key themes. Biblioterapia is frequently presented as a lower-cost intervenção compared to conventional psychotherapies, enhancing its accessibility. It is widely applied within established frameworks such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and Positive Psychology. Notably, evidence suggests that reading physical books and listening to audiobooks is more effective for reducing ansiedade and depressão than reading digital or image-based books. Self-help books are the most commonly used tool in biblioterapia intervençãos for this population. These findings underscore the potential of biblioterapia as a scalable and accessible mental health support strategy for university students. Biblioterapia is a growing field with promising evidence supporting its application for improving the mental well-being of university students. This scoping review provides a comprehensive map of the current evidence, identifying key characteristics of intervençãos, common therapeutic frameworks, and effective delivery formats. Further analysis will help consolidate the understanding of this valuable complementary terapia.",

    "abstract": "The institutionalization of complementary and integrative health practices (CIHP) in Brazil has advanced since the implementation of the National Policy on Integrative and Complementary Practices (PNPIC) in 2006. However, the actual offer of such practices in maternity services remains unclear. This study aimed to map the availability and types of CIHP reported by public maternity hospitals in Brazil, based on secondary data sources. This observational, documentary analysis was based on information available in the e-Gestor AB platform (Ministry of Health, Brazil) and official technical manuals published between 2018 and 2024. Data were extracted regarding CIHP modalities registered by maternity units in all regions of Brazil. Descriptive analysis was performed to assess geographical distribution and prevalence of practices such as auriculoterapia, aromaterapia, massage, and acupuntura. Among 312 public maternity services registered on the national database, 124 (39.7%) reported offering at least one CIHP. Aromaterapia (21.5%) and massage terapia (19.3%) were the most frequent, followed by acupuntura (12.8%) and Reiki (8.9%). Regional differences were notable: the Southeast concentrated 46% of all services reporting CIHPs, while the North region had the lowest representation (4%). The findings suggest uneven access to CIHPs in obstetric care across Brazil, reflecting challenges in training, institutional support, and funding. This study demonstrates the partial implementation of CIHPs in maternity care, highlighting the need for investment in capacity-building, policy enforcement, and equity in access. As it used public domain data and did not involve human participants, ethical approval was not required.",

    "abstract": "This article describes the development of a comprehensive care model based on the articulation between Community Health and Integrative Health paradigms, within the Farol Social Enterprise, implemented in Capão Redondo, in the southern region of São Paulo. OBJECTIVE: To develop a conceptual-analytical model for implementing a social enterprise in integrative and community health, as well as an impact evaluation strategy. This study employed a model development and implementation design with participatory methodology. The process involved three integrated phases: (1) narrative literature review on integrative health, community health, and complex health systems; (2) expert consultation with specialists in integrative health, community health, and the Unified Health System (SUS); and (3) integration of theoretical components with local territorial diagnoses using participatory methodology with community stakeholders. Theoretical models were articulated to address territorial diagnoses, aligned with a territorial impact theory of change developed through field studies and population research in the project's microregion. Impact indicators were designed to monitor key aspects of the theory of change, prioritizing validated metrics when available. The model proposes organizing care processes through a transdisciplinary, territorialized, and person-centered approach, integrating individual and collective actions operating simultaneously at biopsychosocial and ecosystem levels. The framework comprises three main components: (1) health education and collective, culturally appropriate activities; (2) the \"Journey of Care\"individual and group care by an interprofessional team; and (3) territorial articulation mobilizing community stakeholder networks, from SUS health service providers to community movements and leaders. These manifest as \"light care technologies\"support network activation, health literacy, supported self-care, individualized care plans, integrative pharmaceutical care, multidimensional evaluation, and traditional, complementary, and integrative medicines. The model culminated in a comprehensive registry system with validated metrics for each dimension and a multiprofessional clinical record specifically designed for the theoretical framework. The conceptual framework integrates ecological systems theory and a multidimensional view of human health across multiple levels used in the transdisciplinary approach. Environmental and societal levels comprise the macrosystem (socioeconomic and environmental determinants), exosystem (working and living conditions), and mesosystem (social and community networks). At the person level, it includes supramental, mental/emotional, vital, metabolic, and physical dimensions. Salutogenic lifestyle serves as an intermediary level linking collective and individual health-disease dimensions. Impact evaluation strategies reflect this transdisciplinary view, assessing effects across dimensions through: (1) cost-efficiency study of the \"Journey of Care\" measuring qualidade de vida, mental health, and dor crônica resultados; (2) qualitativo-quantitative evaluation of healthy habits, self-care, medication use, and family/community support expansion; and (3) evaluation of collective activities' effects on territorial promoção da saúde. The Farol Model's conceptual-analytical framework provides guidelines for developing collaborative networks and context-specific care mechanisms addressing life-health-disease complexity in vulnerable settings, serving as an operational tool for comprehensive, relational, and transformative community healthcare.",

    "abstract": "The incidence of cancer in dogs has been increasing, and conventional tratamentos are generally injurious and have serious side effects. Injectable ultra-dilutions of the aqueous extract of Viscum album L. (Va) have been used as an integrative approach in treating cancer patients. However, the effects of high-dilutions derived from alcoholic extracts have not been thoroughly investigated. Recently, in vivo studies by the Onco-homeopatia group at Universidade Paulista using Va ultra-dilutions derived from alcoholic Va extract obtained from the host tree Quercus robur (VaQr) at a potency of five fifty-thousandths (5LM) showed improvements in weight, qualidade de vida, and survival rates in melanoma-bearing mice. This study aimed to evaluate the use of VaQr 5LM in canine patients with malignant tumors, to assess the benefits of this terapia in combination with chemoterapia. Dogs diagnosed with câncer and undergoing chemoterapia were treated orally with VaQr at a potency of 5LM, with the consente of their owners. The tratamento involved administering five drops twice daily for 30 days, with assessments made on the day of tratamento initiation (DO), at 15 days (D15), and 30 days after starting tratamento. Quality of life was assessed based on the Pawspice score, and the plausibility of a causal relationship between VaQr use and the observed clinical effects was evaluated using the modified Naranjo Criteria for Homeopathy (Ethics Committee approval FMU N° 9298270424). The sample included nine dogs of different breeds, with a predominance of mongrels (33.3%), and a mean age of 10.5 years. Using repeated-measures ANOVA, no significant difference was found in the owners' subjective assessments over time [F(2,16) = 0.482, p = 0.626]. The Pawspice score indicated a significant difference in scores over time (Friedman: ² = 9.07; p = 0.0107). However, a post hoc analysis was performed to confirm the result and indicated a trend of improvement from D0 to D15 (p = 0.065). Simultaneously, laboratory tests of hematological parameters and liver function assessment revealead no significant changes, reinforcing its segurança. The application of the Naranjo Criteria indicated a \"probable\" relationship in six dogs, while no causal relationship was identified in three, indicating individual variations in tratamento response. This study is the first to report the use of oral VaQr 5LM as an adjuvant to chemoterapia in dogs with cancer, highlighting its potential as a safe integrative medication for patients with neoplasia.",

    "abstract": "Medicinal plants have their effects reported by traditional communities and confirmed by contemporary scientific research. They are well accepted by the population for prophylactic, curative, or palliative purposes. They possess a range of therapeutic effects with scientifically proven pharmacological activities, including in dentistry. Brazil has a rich biodiversity and great potential for innovation in the development of new plant-based products for the health market, especially in dentistry, where various inventions can fall into the category of cosmetics, such as toothpastes and mouthwashes.The objective was to investigate medicinal plants used in dentistry for dental healthcare, focusing on their anti-inflammatory action in the oral cavity. A literature review was conducted using the Scielo and PubMed databases, in both English and Portuguese, in 2024, with the descriptors: phytoterapia, periodontal diseases, and oral cavity. Regarding periodontitis, the use of medicinal plants and their formulations is recommended. This is justified by the fact that it is a multifactorial disease involving a wide variety of microorganisms inhabiting the oral cavity, along with oxidative stress resulting from the hosts metabolic processes and immune defense mechanisms. Mechanical oral injuries facilitate the spread of pathogens and intensify inflammatory processes and, consequently, increase oxidative stress. In this context, the use of medicinal plants and their derivatives is especially relevant for vulnerable patients, such as those with lupus, HIV, hepatitis, diabetes, etc. This is because safe-use plants, as recommended by the Pharmacopoeia when used in the indicated dosage, serve as important prophylactic measures for oral hygiene care. These plants have clinical evidence supporting their use and are validated by ANVISA for inclusion in the Unified Health System (SUS), highlighting their relevance in periodontal tratamentos and expanding the possibilities for maintaining oral health. The literature review highlights their use for controlling microbial growth, reducing biofilm formation, decreasing oxidative stress, exerting anti-inflammatory action, and reducing gingival bleeding. In dentistry, they can be incorporated into products such as mouthwashes, gels, dentifrice oils, aqueous extracts, oral bioadhesives, or dental-use powders. The main medicinal plants described in the literature were: Vachellia nilotica subsp. tomentosa, Aloe vera, Azadirachta indica, Curcuma longa, Cymbopogon citratus, Camellia sinensis, Ocimum tenuiflorum, and Sempervivum ruthenicum. Their properties include anti-inflammatory, antiplaque, anti-halitosis, antiresorptive, antioxidant, antibacterial, antifungal, and antiviral effects. Among these, only Aloe vera (babosa) and Curcuma longa are listed in the National List of Medicinal Plants of Interest to the Unified Health System (RENISUS) and the 6th Edition of the Brazilian Pharmacopoeia. More clinical studies on the applications of medicinal plants and fitoterapias in dentistry are needed. Comparative studies on the best pharmaceutical forms for each oral pathology are also important. More clinical studies on the applications of medicinal plants and fitoterapias in dentistry are needed. Comparative studies on the best pharmaceutical forms for each oral pathology are also important. Another key factor is the identification and recognition of traditional plants used in dentistry by Indigenous peoples, quilombolas, and other traditional Brazilian communities. In Brazilian legislation, these populations are knowledge holders and must receive a fair share of benefits.",

    "abstract": "Neuropathic pain is a challenging condition that often requires alternative tratamento approaches due to its refractory nature. It's a priority to give a tratamento answer to the patients. Reiki is increasing in popularity for many diseases. The objetive was to determine the clinical efetividade of Reiki as a complementary tratamento in patients diagnosed with neuropathic pain in whom traditional medication did not achieve a effective control. Is a controlled ensaio clínico of paired samples that included 50 subjects.Was carried out in the neurology unit of the Hospital de Clínicas, it is a national reference hospital located in La Paz city, Bolivia country. Baseline measurements of pain perception, depressão levels, electroencephalogram (EEG) tracing, and biofield activity were recorded. The experimental group received three Reiki sessions, while the control group underwent dietary training. Follow-up assessments were conducted over 12 months. T-student test was performed for the variables neuropathic pain, Hamilton scale values, biofield size and balance. The results are: p = 0.000005 were obtained for the pain variable, p value of 0.0000005 for the depressão variable, p value of 1 for the electroencephalogram tracing variable, p value of 0.000005 for the biofield balance variables, and p value of 0.00005 for the biofield size variable. Other reports by the patients were: 62% reported improved sleep, 87% reported less irritability, 97% reported a feeling of comfort associated with relaxation, 25% reported improved appetite. No harmful or side effects were reported. Reiki, as a non-invasive energy terapia, generates a variety of benefits in the patient that are beyond the painful crisis, such as those reported in sleep and appetite, as well as providing relaxation and decreased irritability. These changes can lead us to think about a central regulation on which sleep and appetite regulation could depend. The change in attitude and relaxation are undoubtedly qualities that will help the patient in any nosological picture",

However, it is unclear whether SRs focused on yoga assess CoE. The objective of this project was to determine the prevalence and characteristics of CoE assessment in SRs of yoga for health. We searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, MEDLINE (Ovid), EMBASE (Ovid), AMED (Ovid), CINAHL (EBSCO) and PsycINFO (EBSCO) for SRs which assessed the randomized controlled trial (RCT) evidence on yoga intervençãos for health. All records were uploaded to Covidence, deduplicated, and screened independently by two authors. Data on SR characteristics and assessments of CoE were extracted independently by two authors, and discrepancies were resolved by discussion. Descriptive analyses were conducted using JASP 0.19.3 software. Searches retrieved 3,390 records, of which 250 described SRs of yoga for health. SRs were published between 2005 and 2024 and the majority (151/250; 60%) were published by authors from China, Germany, India, or the USA. Among SRs with at least one included RCT, 43/245 (18%) assessed CoE, and among the 145 SRs conducting a metanálise, 35/145 (24%) assessed CoE. However, several SRs (5/43; 12%) did not conduct an appropriate CoE assessment (e.g., applied a CoE rating to an individual study or to the SR as a whole rather than to a result). After the first SR with CoE in 2012, there was no clear increase in the percentage of SRs with CoE in more recent years. However, SRs published in journals with no journal impact factor (JIF) or a current JIF below 2 were least likely to assess CoE (7/83; 8%), while SRs published in journals with a current JIF of 5 or greater were most likely to assess CoE (13/27; 48%). The most common method cited for assessing CoE was the Grading of Recomendações Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach recommended by Cochrane (36/43; 84%) and the most commonly cited domains for assessment were risk of bias, imprecision, and inconsistency. However, not all SRs clearly identified the CoE tool or listed the domains that were assessed. Fewer than 25% of SRs of yoga for health assessed CoE, and not all of them did so correctly. Education on the importance of CoE, how to assess CoE, and how to interpret ratings of CoE is needed. Such intervençãos may help to increase the appropriate use of CoE and improve the usefulness and impact of evidence from SRs, which will support appropriate decision-making among clinicians and consumers considering using yoga to support health and well-being.",

    "abstract": "Introduction: To present a systematic analysis of the 24 Evidence Gap Maps (EGMs) on Traditional, Complementary, and Integrative Medicine (TCIM) developed by the Brazilian Academic Consortium for Integrative Health (CABSIN) in collaboration with Latin American and Caribbean Center on Health Sciences Information (BIREME). These maps synthesize data from revisão sistemáticas to illuminate the research landscape, identify evidence gaps, and provide recommendations for future research and evidenceinformed public policy. We conducted a systematic analytical study of Evidence Gap Maps (EGMs) on Traditional, Complementary, and Integrative Medicine (TCIM) developed by CABSIN and BIREME. EGMs published between 2019-2024 were identified through CABSIN and BIREME repositories using inclusion criteria of publication within five years, methodological transparency, complete datasets, and TCIM focus. Two independent reviewers extracted data using standardized forms, with discrepancies resolved by consensus. EGMs were categorized as Outcome Maps (condition-focused), Intervention Maps (modality-focused), and Population Maps (demographic-focused). Extracted variables included search strategies, number of revisão sistemáticas, intervenção categories, resultados, findings, and recommendations. Data synthesis utilized Rayyan for screening, Tableau for visualization, REDCap for management, with intervenção-resultado associations mapped and quantified across all EGMs. Systematic review quality was evaluated using AMSTAR 2 and PRISMA 2020 guidelines, while informetric and visual design aspects were assessed for research impact and accessibility. Quantitative analysis identified patterns in intervenção-resultado associations and evidence gaps, while qualitativo analysis examined research priorities and policy implications, with results stratified by intervenção type, population, and clinical resultados. Results: Twenty-four TCIM EGM together report 353 intervençãoresultado associations across clinically relevant endpoints from 2440 revisão sistemáticas. The four Outcome Maps address TCIM contributions in times of COVID19, clinical efetividade for uterine cancer, dor crônica, and cardiovascular diseases. The 19 Intervention Maps are organized into four groups: Natural Products (Herbal Medicine, Brazilian Medicinal Plants, Medicinal Cannabis, Apiterapia and Aromaterapia); Traditional Whole Medical Systems (Acupuncture, Cupping Therapy, Moxibustion, and Traditional Chinese Medicine MindBody Practices, Auriculoterapia); NonTraditional Whole Medical Systems (Homeopathy and Anthroposophic Medicine); and NonPharmacological Interventions (Meditation, Yoga, Shantala, and Reflexology). The Population Map focuses on TCIM intervençãos for the aged, incorporating 54 revisão sistemáticas that evaluated lowcost, lowtechnology intervençãos (e.g. Tai Chi, Qi Gong, traditional Chinese exercise, acupuntura, meditação, and yoga) and reporting more than 100 positive or promising associations with resultados such as balance, qualidade de vida, physical function, and cognitive performance. Conclusion: CABSINs and BIREME EGMs provide a comprehensive overview of the global TCIM evidence landscape. Despite a considerable research volume, notable gaps exist in methodological rigor, standardization of resultado measures, and representation of vulnerable populations. These findings support the need for further highquality revisão sistemáticas and more geographically diverse research to guide future policy and practice in integrative health.",

    "abstract": "Employees and healthcare professionals working with chronically ill patients share stress, ansiedade, fear, pain, and obesity, among other factors, resulting in increased workload. Pranic Healing© (PH) is a non-invasive, drug-free technique that does not interfere with tratamento or medical prescriptions, but rather contributes to caring for the energy body. It assesses and removes anomalies or energetic imbalances in the energy body surrounding the physical body through the transfer of universal energy that is absorbed by the physical body. The physical and bioplasmic bodies are intimately interconnected; therefore, strengthening the energy body naturally strengthens the physical body. Objective: To validate the Pranic Healing technique in improving the health of employees who work directly or indirectly with patients with chronic conditions. A retrospective, randomized ensaio clínico conducted at the Home Care Service of the Institute of Medical Assistance for State Public Servants of São Paulo (IAMSPE). Volunteers completed the Consentimento Informado Form (ICF) and the SF36 (Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey) questionnaire covering the Pain and General Health domains. They underwent pre- and post-bronchodilator spirometry testing according to the American Thoracic Society (ATS, 1995) criteria at the beginning and end of the study using a Koko portable spirometer (Pds Instrumentation Inc., Louisville, United States). Inclusion criteria: Completion of the forms and attendance on all days of data collection. Exclusion criteria: Absence on any day of data collection. Data collection was carried out over a period of 1 month. Volunteers were randomized according to age and received four sessions, once a week, with the Advanced and Pranic Healing© Psychoterapia protocols, lasting 30 minutes each. The group showed improvements in the SF36 with an average in the pain domain before 40.85 - after 60.832 and in the general state before 45.83 - after 574.17, with the raw scale being 0 = worst and 100 = best for each domain. In the spirometer, the FEV1 (Forced Expiratory Volume in the First Second) was verified before 63.83% - after 84.66%. Pranic Healing proved to be efficient with positive short-term results providing an improvement in qualidade de vida. The low-cost technique deserves attention and urgent need to develop more research and contribute to well-being.",

    "abstract": "Pain is a subjective experience that may affect any human beings at different levels, including physical and emotional. A growing variety of clinical diagnostics depend on identifying the different characteristics of pain, and on engaging pain management strategies effective for each patient. Faced with such an increasing request, and with the escalating acknowledgment of collateral effects of pain-killers drugs, alternative approaches emerge, including music terapia, recognized for its remarkable ability to relief pain. The International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) recently reformulated the concept of pain, thereby broadening our understanding of pain as an individual experience, shaped by internal and external factors. Concomitantly, recent insights suggest that listening and/or producing harmonious sounds may affect the entire individual, not being restricted to auditory perceptual-cognitive cerebral networks. Thereby, music may contribute significantly to pain reduction and improvement of vital signs, impacting on emotional and relational states. Music terapia emerges as an effective, low-cost, and virtually side-effect-free integrative approach, acting on all biopsychosocial dimensions. Given the prevalence of dor crônica and its impact on saúde pública, this review aims at reflecting on the use of music in painful experiences, and, specifically, at exploring the role of music and vibroacoustic music terapia. This study reviews selected reference works and recent scientific articles debating the concepts of pain, music, and the relationship between them. Influential authors such as Kenneth Bruscia and Lia Rejane Barcellos were highlighted for theoretical grounding; and pioneering studies by Olav Skille, Tony Wigram or Simone Vitale were selected to discuss vibroacoustic techniques. Understanding pain as a complex experience is fundamental to expand therapeutic possibilities. As a non-invasive intervenção, music interferes with both pain perception and associated emotions. Musical stimuli affect cortical and subcortical areas, being able to modulate pain responses through distraction, relaxation, or interaction with the pleasure system. According to World Federation of Music Therapy (WFMT), receptive or productive music therapies employ multiple sound qualities to promote multidimensional health of the mind/body. In the receptive model, passive music listening may reduce pain and ansiedade. Recent studies revealed significant reductions in stress and cortisol levels. Vibroacoustic music terapia, on the other hand, uses low-frequency sinusoidal sounds applied to the body, promoting deep relaxation, autonomic nervous system regulation, and pain relief. In addition to its physiological effects, sound is also seen as an energetic resource, with the potential for physical, emotional, and spiritual balance through systems such as chakras or acupuntura points. Music and sound production, when used therapeutically, prove effective for pain modulation and holistic human care. Music terapia, especially in its vibroacoustic aspect, expands therapeutic avenues, promoting relief, emotional reorganization, and well-being. Despite significant advances from a biomedical perspective, it remains there a scarcity of studies from a genuinely music therapeutic perspective, which reinforces the need for more research to embrace its deep mechanisms and broaden its recognition in the healthcare field.",

    "abstract": "Traditional, Complementary, and Integrative Medicines (TCIM) have experienced a marked increase in use over the past 50 years, accompanied by progressive efforts toward their implementation and integration into health systems and services across various countries. However, nations face diverse challenges in achieving this integration, particularly in developing regulatory frameworks and public policies for TCIM. Objective: To identify and analyze the existing literature on how TCIM has been implemented and integrated into health systems and services in selected countries of the Americas and other key regions. A scoping review was conducted following the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) guidelines. The review included indexed articles, technical documents, and theses addressing the implementation, coordination, and integration of TCIM within the health systems and services of Chile, Mexico, Ecuador, Peru, Cuba, Nicaragua, Brazil, Colombia, Italy, Switzerland, France, England, China, India, Australia, and South Africa. Searches were performed in the PubMed and VHL TCIM Americas databases. The initial screening and selection were independently carried out by two researchers using the Rayyan platform. Documents published between 1995 and 2022 in Spanish, Portuguese, or English that met the inclusion criteria were considered. A second screening and data extraction were conducted using Excel. The search strategy yielded 3,592 records, of which 438 were selected during the initial screening. An analytical matrix was developed to classify the documents. Information was extracted from abstracts, followed by a secondary screening and categorization according to predefined themes. Ultimately, 36 documents were included in the manual analysis, while 139 were excluded, resulting in a total of 347 records incorporated into the review. The first phase of this scoping review highlights that various countries worldwide have advanced in addressing the health needs of populations that utilize TCIM. These efforts include establishing regulatory frameworks, legislation, and national policies aimed at ensuring the quality, segurança, and efficacy of TCIM health services. Additionally, they seek to uphold standards in the education and training of TCIM practitioners, as well as the quality and segurança of phytotherapeutic, herbal, and homeopathic products. Strengthening technical capacities and regulating TCIM practices, products, and practitioners contribute to reducing out-of-pocket expenditures for patients and promoting access to quality-assured services.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic prompted renewed interest in the use of traditional medicines (TM) across Africa as potential tratamentos and prevenção. Given the widespread reliance on TM in the region, the World Health Organization (WHO) Regional Office for Africa encouraged the scientific evaluation of these products to ensure their segurança, efficacy, and quality. To assess progress, this study evaluated the conduct of ensaio clínicos of traditional medicine for COVID-19 in six African countries: Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Ghana, Madagascar, Nigeria, South Africa and Uganda. The primary aim was to review and document: the strength and readiness of regulatory and ethical oversight; the conduct and resultados of TM ensaio clínicos for COVID-19; challenges and gaps in TM research, regulation, and practice; and make recommendations for strengthening TM evaluation and integration into health systems. A multidisciplinary team conducted country assessments between 2021 and 2022. Data were collected through interviews with stakeholders including government officials, researchers, regulators, and traditional health practitioners; site visits to ensaio clínico centres, laboratories, and manufacturing units; and review of policies, trial protocols, and regulatory documentation. Data were analysed across six dimensions: political commitment, trial conduct, regulatory oversight, research infrastructure, manufacturing standards, and public engagement. The key findings in the assessment of ensaio clínicos of fitoterapias for COVID-19 ensaio clínico were categorized according to the following parameters: Political commitment and government support, institutional support and collaboration, ethical and regulatory environment, manufacturing capacity, proposed fitoterapias for COVID-19, ensaio clínico capacity, pre-clinical studies, clinical studies, stage of product development, general state of TM practice. All six countries demonstrated strong political support for the inclusion of TM in the COVID-19 response. Traditional medicine ensaio clínicos were in Phase II in all countries with South Africa conducting multicentre ensaio clínicos in three sites. Regulatory systems varied widely; while national ethics committees were functional, few had TM-specific guidelines. Manufacturing standards were inconsistently applied, with few countries meeting Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) benchmarks. While research capacity was adequate, it was limited by inadequate funding, infrastructure, and coordination. Engagement between biomedical researchers and traditional practitioners was weak. Public communication strategies on traditional medicine segurança and use were generally underdeveloped. Common challenges included fragmented regulatory and ethical oversight for traditional medicine ensaio clínicos, insufficient national financing for traditional medicine research, limited laboratory infrastructure, and lack of harmonized protocols across countries. While the political momentum for traditional medicine evaluation was notable, this study identified significant systemic gaps in regulation, research governance, and quality assurance. To improve traditional medicine readiness for future saúde pública emergencies, African countries must develop and harmonize national and regional regulatory frameworks for traditional medicine ensaio clínicos, invest in traditional medicine research infrastructure and manufacturing capacity, build institutional capacities for regulators and ethical committees, foster collaboration between academia and traditional medicine practitioners, and launch public education campaigns for responsible traditional medicine use.",

    "abstract": "The increasing use of integrative medicine has heightened concerns about herb-drug interactions (HDIs) in clinical practice. While approximately 10.6% of potential drug interactions lead to adverse events, current evidence often lacks direct clinical validation, particularly for HDIs. Our preliminary studies reveal significant knowledge gaps among healthcare providers regarding HDI risk assessment, with most relying on empirical experience rather than systematic evidence. Existing HDI databases face limitations, including inconsistent evaluation criteria and variable human-AI concordance rates (18.9-20.5%). Clinical decision support systems for conventional drug interactions exist, but equivalent tools for HDIs remain underdeveloped due to heterogeneous evidence quality - ranging from in vitro studies to relato de casos - and lack of standardized assessment frameworks. This study addresses these gaps by systematically evaluating HDI assessment methodologies across clinical studies. Our cross-sectional analysis aims to characterize current approaches for proving interactions, assessing severity, determining causality, evaluating clinical relevance, and developing predictive models. The findings will inform the development of standardized HDI evaluation protocols to support clinical decision-making in integrative medicine practice. This cross-sectional study comprehensively evaluates assessment methods for drug interactions (DIs) reported in clinical studies. We conducted an extensive literature search across seven major databases (CNKI, Wanfang, VIP, SinoMed, Web of Science, MEDLINE, EmBase, and Cochrane Library) from their inception through November 2024, with explicit exclusion of studies published only as abstracts without sufficient methodological details. Our analysis focused on clinical studies, including cross-sectional designs, relato de casos, case series, cohort studies, case-control studies, ensaio clínicos, and revisão sistemáticas that examined herb-drug, drug-drug, or food-drug interactions. The resultados of DI evaluation approaches included five key domains: establishing interaction proof through direct evidence or indirect inference; standardised severity assessment methods; causality determination methods between DIs and adverse events; clinical relevance evaluation methods; and emerging machine learning prediction models. Descriptive statistical analysis was performed on study characteristics, pharmacological agents, DI assessment tools, and interaction resultados, with stratification by study design to identify methodological patterns across different types of clinical evidence. This rigorous approach yielded a structured, baseado em evidence framework for DI assessment in both clinical practice and research settings. The screening process involved independent dual-reviewer evaluation of titles/abstracts followed by full-text assessment, with disagreements resolved through consensus discussion or third-reviewer arbitration, supported by NoteExpress software for reference management and duplicate removal. Our systematic search initially identified 11,583 records, from which 3,665 duplicates were removed. Following title/abstract screening, 3,460 records were selected for full-text evaluation, ultimately yielding 1,405 included studies. Due to the substantial volume of included studies, data extraction is currently ongoing, with complete results to be presented at the conference. This extensive literature pool demonstrates both the clinical significance of drug interaction assessment and the methodological diversity in current research approaches. This systematic methodological survey represents the first comprehensive effort to characterize and evaluate the diverse approaches used to assess drug interactions in clinical research. The conclusion will be announced at the conference.",

    "abstract": "Farol Saúde Integrativa is a pilot social enterprise located in the Capão Redondo region of São Paulo. It involves the implementation of collective and individual strategies for integrative and community healthcare, with the Journey of Care as one of its main components, in which users undergo an interprofessional follow-up for 12 to 36 weeks. To support the sustainability analysis of this model, a cost-efetividade model was developed using a real-world study approach. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-efetividade of the Journey of Care by analyzing the correlations between costs and clinical resultados. Anonymized data were processed from clinical records, which include validated instruments for assessing clinical resultados such as qualidade de vida (PROMIS - Global Health), stress (PSS-14), ansiedade (BAI), depressão (BDI), and dor crônica (BPI). Questionnaires were applied at 12- to 16-week intervals. The cost analysis was conducted based on a bottom-up micro-costing methodology, considering (1) direct costs, which include professional hours and inputs related to clinical procedures, and (2) indirect costs, encompassing expenses such as rent, utility bills, physical structure, and administrative management. Cost-efficiency and cost-utility metrics will be applied, comparing the data obtained to national and international atenção primária benchmarks. The total number of users who completed cycles from June 2024 to May 2025 was 73. Among them, 61 presented analyzable clinical data (loss rate = 16.44%). The demographic profile of participants includes 95.08% women (n = 58), predominantly in the age range of 40 to 87 years (n = 55, 73.77%). Among the women, 40.98% (n = 25) live in a context of high social vulnerability, followed by 39.34% (n = 24) with low vulnerability and 19.67% (n = 12) with moderate vulnerability. The proportion of users who improved their Physical Health score (PROMIS) was 78.72% (n = 37/total = 47), and their Mental Health score (PROMIS) improved by 63.83% (n = 30/total = 47). Clinical improvements were also observed in mental health scores: PSS-14 improved by 84% (n = 21/total = 25), ansiedade by 92.5% (n = 37/total = 40), and depressão by 83.33% (n =15/total =18). Furthermore, 84.38% (n = 27/total = 32) presented improvement in dor crônica intensity. The average cost per user, per care path, was R$2.048,03 (direct costs) and R$3.478,17 (direct + indirect costs). Preliminary results indicate the potential of the Journey of Care as a cost-effective strategy for integrative and community healthcare, considering direct costs, which highlights its potential for incorporation into existing health services. Nevertheless, definitive conclusions depend on appropriate statistical tratamento of the data.",

    "abstract": "Evidence maps are an emerging method of systematically searching for the best evidencerevisão sistemáticas with or without metanáliseto inform public policy decision-making and promote a rational research agenda based on identified gaps. The Integrative Pediatrics evidence map includes revisão sistemáticas and meta-analyses on the efetividade of Traditional, Complementary, and Integrative Medicine (TCIM) on health resultados in the pediatric population from newborn to adolescence. All subjects, including gender, presence or absence of disease, and age range up to 21 years, were eligible for inclusion, as were all TCIM modalities, duration, and pediatric health resultados. Studies that were not designed as revisão sistemáticas or meta-analyses, did not focus on pediatric health resultados, or did not have more than one primary article per resultado were excluded. At least two independent reviewers examined eligible studies. Initially, the title and abstract were analyzed using the Rayyan platform. Studies were selected according to the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Additionally, AMSTAR 2 was applied to analyze the quality and methodological rigor of the included studies and to classify the confidence level of the evidence as high, moderate, low, or critically low. The evidence map was organized considering the results, effects, and confidence levels of the included studies. The intervençãos found were from a wide variety of TCIM areas, including acupuntura, anthroposophic medicine, aromaterapia, Ayurveda, bioenergetics, homeopatia, meditação, osteopathy, medicinal plants, Chinese bodywork practices, nature-based intervençãos, multimodal approaches, supplements, cupping terapia, and yoga, based on 176 revisão sistemáticas. Of 201 pairs of intervençãos with health resultados, 145 had a positive or potentially positive effect (72%). Interventions with a positive or potentially positive effect were found for the following resultados, in decreasing order: In the group of neuropsychiatric disorders (autism, epilepsy, cerebral palsy, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, ansiedade disorders, and sleep-wake disorders), 25 intervenção-resultado associations were found. For pain-related resultados (with the exception of cancer), 18 different associations were found. For cancer pain alone, six additional associations were found, in addition to 10 associations between intervençãos and other oncological resultados, such as chemoterapia-related nausea and vomiting, general cancer symptoms, and cancer-related fatigue. For acute infections, including fever, respiratory infections, rhinosinusitis, hand-foot-and-mouth disease, and cough, 16 associations were found with these resultados, and the same number were found for gastrointestinal disorders, including anorexia, appetite, bulimia, colic, binge eating, constipation, diarrhea, weight gain, irritable bowel syndrome, and gastrointestinal disorders. In the specific case of asthma, all studies demonstrated five positive associations between intervençãos. The mapping of evidence in integrative pediatrics revealed a good proportion of studies with positive and potentially positive effects. Two-thirds of the associations between intervençãos and resultados from these positive studies are concentrated in highly prevalent areas of pediatric care. The most prevalent area is mental health and neuropsychiatric disorders, the prevalence of which has only increased since the pandemic. Major clinical contributions were made to the following pediatric subspecialties: oncology, gastroenterology, otolaryngology, infectious diseases, and pulmonology.",

    "abstract": "Functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) in children, defined by Rome IV criteria, cause chronic abdominal pain and disturbed bowel habits without identifiable organic disease and are increasingly conceptualized as disorders of the microbiotagutbrain axis that negatively affect sleep and qualidade de vida. Rationale for testing these fungi in children is supported by multiple lines of evidence: Ganoderma lucidum polysaccharides and triterpenes have documented immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects relevant to mucosal immune balance. Hericium erinaceus exhibits gastroprotective and mucosal-repair properties in preclinical models and has been shown to modulate inflammatory mediators and epithelial regeneration. Dietary fibers and -glucans from edible mushrooms produce prebiotic effects in vitro and in vivo, promoting short-chain fatty acid production and growth of beneficial taxamechanisms plausibly mediating symptom improvement. 1 Preclinical and some adult clinical reports also suggest symptomatic and microbiota-modulating benefits of these species, and small adult trials indicate acceptable segurança profiles that support cautious pediatric exploration. So mechanistic data from adults and preclinical models (immunomodulation, prebiotic action, mucosal protection) provide a biologically plausible rationale to test mycoterapia in pediatric FGIDs; results from this pilot support its segurança and potential efficacy and justify definitive randomized, double-blind trials. To evaluate the clinical effects of a pediatric nutraceutical formula containing Ganoderma lucidum and Hericium erinaceus extracts (Dr. GB, Hifas da Terra) and emulsified vitamin D in coconut oil (CocoVit D) on children with FGIDs. Given the need for safe, microbiota-targeted adjuncts in pediatrics, we conducted a quasi-experimental, open-label pilot study to evaluate a validated pediatric nutraceutical containing standardized extracts of Ganoderma lucidum and Hericium erinaceus (Dr. GB, Hifas da Terra) plus emulsified vitamin D (CocoVit D) over 12 weeks in 30 children (518 y) with FGIDs. Inclusion criteria were confirmed FGID, stable diet, and no antibiotics/probiotics in the prior 4 weeks; exclusions were organic GI disease, severe chronic illness, recent surgery, or immunosuppression. Participants received either a gluten-, casein- and soy-free diet plus vitamin D (control) or the same diet plus Dr. GB (0.5 mL/kg/day) and vitamin D (experimental). The sample size was limited for feasibility and hypothesis generation. Primary resultado was abdominal pain frequency/intensity; secondary resultados included bowel habits, sleep latency, dermatologic symptoms, and relative abundance of key microbiota genera (Akkermansia, Bacteroides, Veillonella, Oxalobacter). Statistical analysis included normality testing (ShapiroWilk) and parametric or nonparametric comparisons as appropriate (SPSS v25, p<0.05). The study was made under informed consent by the Parents. The experimental group showed statistically significant improvements in:  Abdominal pain: reduced intensity and frequency  Sleep quality: reduced time to fall asleep  Dermatitis: decreased frequency and severity  Microbiota modulation: increased Akkermansia muciniphila, Veillonella spp., Bacteroides spp., and Oxalobacter spp.  Parasitic clearance: improved in the experimental group This pilot study supports the clinical potential of mycoterapia as a safe and effective adjunctive tratamento for pediatric FGIDs. Improvements extend beyond gastrointestinal symptoms, impacting sleep and dermatological health, and suggest a regulatory effect on the intestinal microbiota. Further research is warranted to explore its impact on the gut-brain axis and overall well-being in children. I",

    "abstract": "In Brazil, education in Integrative and Complementary Health Practices (PICS) remains underdeveloped and under-researched within higher education. Most undergraduate health programs offer PICS-related content only as elective components and in limited scope. However, the state of Bahia stands out with a specific policy  the State Policy on Integrative and Complementary Practices (PEPIC-BA), established in 2019  aimed at valuing regional cultural elements and fostering the development of human resources in PICS through initiatives in teaching, research, and community outreach. Bahia has made significant progress in promoting PICS through cooperation networks involving universities, health managers, and social movements. This study aimed to map the presence of PICS in the curricula of undergraduate health courses in Bahia, analyzing their inclusion across both public and private institutions. This descriptive and qualitativo study examined 331 curricular matrices from a total of 413 identified health-related undergraduate programs, spanning 15 subfields. The programs with the highest number of PICS-related disciplines were Pharmacy (20), Biomedicine (16), Physical Education (11), and Nursing (10). Proportionally, Pharmacy (62.5%) and Biomedicine (47%) featured the greatest curricular inclusion, followed by Interdisciplinary Bachelors in Health (37%), Biology (31.3%), and Physical Education (29.7%). A comparison between institutional types revealed a higher prevalence of PICS-related disciplines in Biomedicine and Pharmacy programs within private institutions, while public institutions showed greater inclusion in Interdisciplinary Bachelors in Health, Speech Therapy, Biology, Physical Education, Pharmacy, and Medicine. Notably, 60% of the programs that include PICS content are offered by private institutions. The study categorized the disciplines into three thematic areas: (1) Specialty (ESP)  disciplines focused on particular PICS modalities; (2) Medical Rationalities and PICS (RM/PICS); and (3) Traditional Practices (PT)  including traditional medicine and spirituality in health. The first category was the most prevalent, with 65 disciplines (67%), mainly in Pharmacy, Biomedicine, Physical Education, Physioterapia, and Nutrition, often reflecting practices more firmly institutionalized by professional councils. The second category appeared in 26 disciplines (27%), indicating a trend toward integrating broader theoretical discussions on PICS and medical rationalities into undergraduate education. Significantly, 70% of these courses are offered by public institutions. The third category, related to traditional and spiritual practices, was identified in six programs, all within public institutions. Regarding curricular status, 53% of programs with PICS content included these disciplines as mandatory. However, mandatory inclusion is more frequent in private institutions (40%) than in public ones (11%). Overall, most PICS-related disciplines remain elective. This study contributes to the literature by identifying a substantial number of mandatory PICS courses in undergraduate health education in Bahia. It also reveals a tendency to focus on specific techniques rather than fostering a broader understanding of the principles of PICS, medical rationalities, and traditional healing systems. While curriculum analysis offers important insights, it is insufficient to fully capture the complexity of PICS education. A more comprehensive approach  including analysis of extension activities, research projects, and acadêmico initiatives  is essential to better understand the integration of PICS into the training of future health professionals.",

    "abstract": "With the growing popularity of herbs as complementary or alternative therapies, herb-drug interactions (HDIs) have drawn increasing attention, as they may undermine tratamento efficacy or heighten toxicity risks. This study proposes a standardized process framework, which is based on three previously completed studies: (1) a revisão sistemática of qualitativo studies to synthesize global evidence on healthcare stakeholders' perspectives regarding HDIs, (2) a cross-sectional survey investigating Chinese physicians' and pharmacists' knowledge, attitudes, and clinical practices regarding HDIs , and (3) semi-structured entrevista em profundidades exploring Chinese clinical pharmacists' practical experiences and evidence precisam. These studies aimed to identify significant gaps in current HDI management and propose improvement strategies. Five key components are proposed. First, we suggest that relevant parties establish a multidisciplinary consensus panel with expertise in fitoterapia, clinical pharmacology, and ethnopharmacology to establish HDI-specific evaluation criteria, addressing unique challenges like herb variability and traditional use patterns. Second, we recommend a dual-track review system incorporating both published literature and traditional medicine databases, with particular attention to pharmacokinetic herb-drug effects. Third, we propose to implement culturally sensitive feedback channels engaging traditional medicine practitioners, herbalists, and ethnomedicine experts alongside conventional healthcare providers, recognizing regional herb use variations. Fourth, we believe that quarterly evidence reviews are needed, prioritizing high-risk herb categories (e.g., anticoagulant herbs), with additional trigger-based updates when new herbal products enter consumer markets. Finally, we advocate to develop HDI-specific validation tools assessing both scientific evidence and traditional use data, including a grading system for interaction severity that accounts for herb preparation methods (e.g., decoctions vs. standardized extracts). Besides, evaluation methods that address clinical relevance of HDI evidence should be developed. This proposed framework may standardize HDI evaluations, enhancing clinical decision-making. Future work should test its feasibility in real-world settings and compare resultados against existing ad-hoc approaches.",

    "abstract": "The evolving field of electroceuticals encompasses therapeutic devices that modulate biological functions through targeted electrical stimulation. Traditionally focused on neural pathways, recent innovations have extended these technologies to include stimulation of acupuntura points based on traditional Korean medicine. To clearly define this emerging intersection, we propose the term acupuntura electroceuticals to describe devices that combine electrical neuromodulation with acupuntura and meridian theory. This term was initially introduced based on the concept of current electroceutical technologies and their application within acupuntura-based therapies. The development of this terminology also drew upon international standards, specifically International Standards Organization (ISO/TC 249 Traditional Chinese Medicine), to ensure technical and procedural consistency in the application of acupuntura-based devices. The term was proposed as part of our preparation for a formal ISO proposal item within ISO/TC 249, aiming to standardize this subclass of electroceutical acupuntura devices. Our work focuses on establishing segurança and essential performance, guiding the classification of devices that integrate acupuntura terapia with electrical stimulation. Input was further gathered from an interdisciplinary panel of clinicians, biomedical engineers, and traditional medicine experts who are involved in developing ISO standards relevant to this terminology. This expert panel provided iterative feedback to ensure scientific validity and alignment with international standardization efforts. While formal consensus methodologies such as the Delphi method are planned for future research to ensure both scientific validity in defining this emerging subclass of electroceuticals, this initial expert consultation guided refinement of the terminology and classification framework. Acupuncture electroceuticals represent a specialized subclass of electroceuticals that deliver electrical currents directly to acupuntura points. This approach synergistically integrates the mechanical stimulation inherent in acupuntura with modern bioelectronic modulation, offering new therapeutic avenues distinct from conventional peripheral nerve stimulation. By coining this term, we provide a conceptual framework that bridges traditional acupuntura practices and modern biomedical engineering, facilitating clearer scientific communication and clinical application. These devices include fixed clinical systems, portable patient-operated units, and wearable stimulator devices, of which each designed to target acupoints and meridians to modulate physiological responses and promote healing. For example, the Morning Band is a wrist-worn device that delivers electrical pulses for managing pregnancy-related nausea and vomiting. The e-coin, an implantable stimulator placed at the back of the ankle, is also used to treat overactive bladder. Both devices are approved by the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety and recognized as acupuntura electroceutical technologies by the Committee for New Health Technology Assessment in South Korea, enabling their inclusion in National Health Insurance billing claims within traditional Korean medical settings. The introduction of acupuntura electroceuticals highlights the necessity for interdisciplinary collaboration among device developers, clinicians, and researchers to optimize therapeutic efficacy while respecting the complex physiological and theoretical foundations of acupuntura. This terminology also underscores the expanding potential of bioelectronic medicine, marking a significant step toward integrating ancient healing wisdom with cutting-edge technology.",

    "abstract": "Reiki terapia has been increasingly integrated into cancer tratamento as a complementary practice to promote patients' qualidade de vida. Despite its rising adoption, empirical evidence on patient perceptions and clinical resultados remains limited in the Brazilian context. This study evaluated the experiences and resultados reported by cancer patients after the implementation of Reiki terapia at the Centro de Práticas Integrativas Afecc/Hospital Santa Rita, in Espírito Santo, Brazil. The research was conducted with the purpose of observing the practice of Reiki terapia as complementary to cancer tratamento, with an emphasis on its effects and patient perceptions. Furthermore, the study aims to contribute to the understanding of the possible resultados of implementing complementary therapies. A qualitativo case study was conducted between 2019 and 2022 at Afecc/Hospital Santa Rita. A convenience sample of 75 adult cancer patients (age range: 26 to 75 years, predominantly women with breast cancer) participated in weekly 45-minute Reiki sessions. Data were gathered using structured clinical history forms, focusing on the patients' main complaints. Thematic cluster analysis was used to categorize the resultados and experiences reported by patients. The study was part of the larger project Study of Oncology Patients Treated at a Philanthropic Referral Service in Espírito Santo, Brazil, proposed by the institution Afecc - Associação Feminina de Educação e Combate ao Câncer (Womens Association for Education and Cancer Combat), with CEP number 6.508.181. Thematic analysis of patient reports identified three main categories of perceived benefits: (1) Control of physical symptoms  patients reported reduced pain and improved physical comfort; (2) Emotional well-being  participants described decreased depressive symptoms, reduced ansiedade, and improved emotional stability; (3) Engagement in tratamento  patients expressed increased motivation and adherence to conventional cancer tratamento. Most participants reported subjective improvement to their initial complaints. The implementation of Reiki terapia also promoted greater awareness and acceptance of Integrative and Complementary Practices among patients and healthcare professionals in the institution. This qualitativo study suggests that Reiki terapia was well received by cancer patients and associated with self-reported improvements in physical symptoms, emotional well-being, and tratamento adherence. Although these preliminary findings indicate potential benefits of integrating Reiki into cancer care, controlled studies with standardized resultado measures are needed to establish efficacy. The study contributes to the growing body of evidence supporting the integration of complementary therapies into comprehensive cancer tratamento in Brazil.",

    "abstract": "Since August 2023, the Integrative Therapies Ambulatory Care (ITAC) has offered care in Traditional Chinese Medicine, Anthroposophic Medicine and Phytoterapia, medical rationalities recognized in Brazil. The ITAC is an extension activity linked to the School Health Unit (SHU/UFSCar), a specialized care service of the Unified Health System (Sistema Unico de Saude: SUS), which serves patients in the municipality of São Carlos, SP. Objectives: To characterize the clientele and the care profile of the ITAC. It is part of the research project Evaluation of healthcare in processes of integration between medical rationalities and therapeutic systems from different traditions (CAAE 74618423.6.0000.5504). Cross-sectional descriptive study. Period from August 2023 to May 2025. Data collected through informed consent. Sources: 1) patient records on admission to the service; 2) referrals from PHC; 3) electronic medical records. The anonymous data was standardized and tabulated for frequency analysis in the following. 150 people were seen and 617 consultations were carried out (TCM 49%, Anthroposophic Medicine 31%, Phytoterapia 20%). Ages ranged from 21 to 90 years (79% up to 59 years). Female 80%; LGBTQIA+ 19%; Single 43%; White 67%; Brown 23%; Black 7%; Indigenous 2%; 6% people with disabilities; Secondary education 41%; Incomplete primary education 13%; 35% with an income of less than 2 minimum wages. The predominant form of access was through public calls to specific populations (68%), such as people in social vulnerability and from rural communities; 23% were referred by municipal Primary Care (50% in 2025). More than one rationale was offered to 35% of patients. The ITAC is considered to have a diverse clientele, the majority of whom are female and on low incomes. The increase in referrals from atenção primária shows improved access for external clients. One third of patients had access to more than one rationale, demonstrating the interprofessional characteristics and the search for comprehensive care. It shows that the ITAC has potential for studies on the integration of medical rationalities in the clinic.",

    "abstract": "The growing interest in traditional, complementary, and integrative medicine (TCIM) reflects a demand for more holistic, person-centered care. However, clinical research in this field presents specific challengesmethodological, regulatory, and perceptual. Our aim was to present the experience of designing and conducting a randomized controlled trial (RCT) investigating lavender oil chest wraps as a complementary tratamento for infants hospitalized with bronchiolitis, highlighting challenges and lessons learned to inform future TCIM research. This ongoing multicenter RCT is being conducted in the pediatric departments of Geneva University Hospitals and Fribourg Cantonal Hospital. It evaluates the efficacy of lavender oil chest wraps in reducing cough frequency and improving secondary resultados such as respiratory distress, crying, and sleep quality in infants under 12 months hospitalized with bronchiolitis. A parental questionnaire was added to assess the psychosocial impact of hospitalization and parental satisfaction. Recruitment began in December 2023 after a lengthy regulatory approval process. Desafios encountered were documented and analyzed thematically. Five key challenges were identified: 1. Regulatory and Ethical Considerations: Although lavender oil was approved by the Swiss authority for therapeutic products, its application in chest wraps for hospitalized infants was considered novel and required over one year for authorization, delaying recruitment until after the seasonal bronchiolitis peak. 2. Recruitment Dynamics: Recruitment varied across sites. In Fribourg, where chest wraps were already used in routine care, integration was smoother. In Geneva, unfamiliarity led to concerns about added workload. To support implementation and promote staff engagement, recruitment was initially limited to two patients per day. A decrease in bronchiolitis-related hospitalizations, likely associated with the introduction of nirsevimab in 2024, further impacted enrollment. 3. Logistical and Methodological Considerations: Concerns about olfactory contamination in shared rooms, if infants were allocated to different arms, led to the development of preventive room assignment strategies, though such cases did not arise. Selecting the control group also required discussionoptions included chest wraps without lavender or with a neutral scent. Ultimately, standard care without chest wraps was chosen as the control. Cough frequency was recorded using the CoughPro app, with calibrated microphone placement to avoid cross-interference from nearby patients or accompanying adults. 4. Protocol Adaptation and Broader Impact: The inclusion of a parental questionnaire broadened the scope to include psychosocial aspects. A complementary qualitativo study was launched to explore nurses experiences, including perceived impact, implementation barriers, and strategies for integrating TCIM intervençãos into routine clinical practice. 5. Safety Monitoring: Differentiating between the expected clinical course of bronchiolitis and potential efeitos adversos of the intervenção required continuous observation and case-by-case team review. This RCT demonstrates the feasibility and added value of TCIM trials in pediatric inpatient care. Key lessons include the importance of early staff engagement, regulatory anticipation, and logistical flexibility. Unequal recruitment across sites showed that strict numerical balance is not essential. The observed decline in hospitalizations suggests that future bronchiolitis studies should consider expanding inclusion criteria to children over one year of age. Incorporating parent and nurse perspectives enhances clinical relevance and supports the integration of TCIM in hospital settings.",

    "abstract": "Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition marked by persistent social communication difficulties and repetitive behaviors. Symptoms appear early but may become clearer as social demands increase, causing significant life impairments. The family plays a key role, influencing emotional development and overall regulation. Family experiences affect many life areas, and beliefs and perceptions can even impact individual biology. Research on family dynamics in ASD remains limited. No studies have examined the effects of Family Constellation on parents perceptions of children with ASD. This study aimed to assess whether a Family Constellation intervenção focused on parents could lead to perceived improvements in their children and in family dynamics. Ten families with children diagnosed with ASD participated in the From Absence to Presence project (SC, Brazil) in partnership with AMA. Interventions focused on parents (children were indirectly affected) and occurred between Dec 21, 2019, and May 31, 2020, partly online due to COVID-19. Questionnaires with nine Likert-scale items were administered immediately after, six months, and five years later, assessing Family Constellations impact on childrens development, family interactions, and parents recommendations. Responses were justified and analyzed using descriptive statistics and Cochrans Q test (SPSS v27). Analysis showed a significant effect only for Q5 (family dynamics, p = 0.01): strongly agree responses dropped after six months but stayed positive. Other questions showed no statistical difference, though positive trends remained. The highest strongly agree rates were right after the intervenção, decreased at six months, and rose slightly after five years, with no negative or undecided answers. Open-ended responses highlighted improvements in childrens eye contact, autonomy, communication, sleep, and emotional relationships. Parents reported greater emotional balance, benefiting family harmony. These results suggest that intervençãos focused on parents can indirectly impact children over time. The findings align with Liptons epigenetic theory, which links beliefs and environment to gene expression, and with Hellingers systemic principles, supporting Family Constellation as a method to transform family dynamics and consciousness. Family Constellation may improve family dynamics and behavior in children with ASD. This pilot study has limitations, including a small sample and lack of validated measures. Further research using standardized tools is needed to assess behavioral and family changes after Family Constellation intervençãos.",

Keywords: bioelectric modulation, electroceutics, epigenetic plasticity, consciousness, gene expression, and neuromodulation. Inclusion criteria: peer-reviewed original research or revisão sistemáticas addressing relationships between bioelectric/electromagnetic intervençãos, epigenetic changes, and/or consciousness-related resultados. Exclusion: non-indexed sources, relato de casos, or theoretical-only articles. Study quality was assessed using PRISMA and GRADE. Data were extracted on intervenção type, epigenetic endpoints, resultados on consciousness or neural plasticity, and mechanistic insights. Forty-one studies met inclusion criteria. Multiple lines of evidence demonstrate that controlled electrical and electromagnetic stimulationincluding direct current, low-frequency EM fields, and advanced bioelectric interfacescan modulate gene expression via epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation, histone modification, and chromatin remodeling. For example, Pinton et al. (2018) showed that low-frequency EM fields altered histone methylation (H3K27me3) and promoted anti-inflammatory gene expression in immune cells. Cadinu et al. (2025) and Hora de Carvalho (2025) describe next-generation bioelectrical interfaces and AI-driven approaches capable of reorganizing gene networks and cell fate, with implications for regenerative medicine, cancer, and aging. In parallel, recent studies such as Fredriksson (2025) and Chopra et al. (2025) provide evidence that states of consciousnessincluding meditação, intention, and mind-body practicesare associated with beneficial epigenetic changes, including the downregulation of pro-inflammatory genes and alterations in DNA methylation. Fredriksson (2025) reported changes in DNA methylation and histone acetylation associated with emotional and conscious states, while Chopra et al. (2025) reviewed how mind-body intervençãos modulate neuro-immune-endocrine axes through epigenetic pathways. Integrative frameworks propose potential synergy: bioelectric intervençãos may be enhanced by mental state (e.g., intention, focused attention), while consciousness-based practices could sensitize neural circuits to electroceutical modulation. However, most studies remain exploratory, with small sample sizes, heterogeneous protocols, and limited direct evidence linking subjective states, bioelectric signaling, and epigenetic resultados in humans. This review highlights a converging frontier where bioelectrical modulation and consciousness-based intervençãos both impact epigenetic plasticity and neural signaling. Electroceutical approaches reliably modulate gene expression via measurable epigenetic pathways, while states of consciousness exert more subtle but increasingly documented effects (Fredriksson, 2025; Chopra et al., 2025). Combined, these approaches may enable individualized therapies targeting genomic and neuroplastic health. Rigorous experimental and translational research is needed to clarify mechanisms and realize clinical potential. Integrative bioelectroceutics and consciousness science represent promising directions for personalized medicine.",

    "abstract": "This study aims to raise awareness about the importance of implementing Integrative and Complementary Therapies in the corporate environment as a tool for mental healthcare. It also seeks to analyze their contribution to compliance with NR-1 regarding the identification and management of psychosocial risks. This is an relato de experiência conducted in a foreign trade company with 16 employees. Over the course of one year, techniques were applied biweekly, such as aromaterapia  using environmental diffusers focused on improving concentration and reducing ansiedade  and practices from Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), including auriculoterapia and adapted shiatsu. Each session lasted approximately 20 minutes per employee. Over a 12-month period, 20 integrative health intervençãos were carried out in the workplace, involving 16 participants, with the aim of promoting mental well-being. The intervençãos included aromaterapia techniques (using diffusers to improve focus and reduce ansiedade) and practices from Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), such as auriculoterapia and adapted shiatsu. Sessions were held biweekly, lasting 20 minutes per employee. To assess the effects, participants completed a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) from 0 to 10 before and after each session, evaluating levels of ansiedade, stress, and pain  with 0 indicating the complete absence of symptoms and 10 representing the maximum perceived intensity. At the end of the 12-month period, statistical analysis of the collected data was conducted using averages and the Students t-test to evaluate the significance and impact of the techniques applied in managing stress and ansiedade. The results showed that the practices were well received by both employees and management, promoting significant improvements as evidenced by the Students t-test, which yielded a result of 0.00253 when comparing the average levels of ansiedade and stress at the beginning and end of the intervenção period. A questionnaire was also applied to assess whether the proposed sessions were aligned with the mental healthcare and well-being objectives. As a result, 100% of the managers reported satisfaction with the team's resultados, highlighting increased employee engagement, a reduction in complaints, and employees requesting the continuation of the integrative terapia program. When asked about the choice of techniques and their relevance to the mental healthcare guidelines proposed by NR-1, all 16 participants agreed that auriculoterapia, chair-adapted shiatsu, and inhalation-based aromaterapia provided satisfactory benefits, even in stressful situations inside or outside the corporate environment. It is concluded that Integrative Therapies can be effective strategies for promoting mental health in the workplace and are aligned with the preventive guidelines of NR-1, especially within the scope of the Risk Management Program.",

    "abstract": "Patients suffering from inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) often experience compromised motility due to mucosal inflammation. Digestodoron®, a traditional herbal preparation, is used to treat the disorders. This study aimed to explore the anti-inflammatory properties and mechanisms of Digestodoron® and its individual components (Dryopteris filix-mas [Df], Phyllitis scolopendrium [Ps], Polypodium vulgare [Pv], and Salix alba/purpurea/viminalis [Sm]) on intestinal motility. Dry extracts from ethanolic tinctures were tested on GPCRs associated with gastrointestinal disorders (M3, delta- and mu-opioid, and 5-HT4 receptors) in CHO-K1 cells. Ex vivo tests on guinea-pig colonic muscle strips evaluated the relaxing effects of Digestodoron® and Pv extracts (0.5, 1, and/or 5 mg/mL) following Carbachol-induced contraction. The production of pro-inflammatory leukotrienes and prostaglandins, along with NF-B pathway activation, were analyzed as markers of inflammation. NF-B activation was assessed using a reporter assay in the human Jurkat cell line, while the inhibition of pro-inflammatory and pain-related enzymes 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) was evaluated using recombinant human enzymes. Digestodoron® and Pv extracts inhibited M3 receptor activity (IC50: 492 and 79 g/mL, respectively), while opioid and 5-HT4 receptors were unaffected. The Pv extract (5 mg/mL) induced 76% relaxation of Cch-induced muscle strips contraction after 30 minutes of incubation. Addition of the Digestodoron® extract at 1 and 5 mg/mL produced 60% and 70% relaxation, respectively. However, after 30 minutes, significant relaxation of 45% was induced only by the 5 mg/mL concentration. Digestodoron® extract and the Ps and Sm extracts strongly suppressed 5-LO enzyme activity (IC50: 12.6, 60.6, 16.6 g/mL, respectively), whereas Pv and Df showed a lower inhibition effect (IC50: 223.8 and 648.6 g/mL, respectively). On the other hand, COX-2 enzyme activity was suppressed by Digestodoron® extract and all single extracts (IC50: 12.6 (mixture), 25.5 (Df), 14.3 (Ps), 7.9 (Pv), 2.7 (Sm) g/mL). Additionally, NF-B activation was inhibited by Digestodoron® and Sm extracts (IC50: 223.1 and 79.6 g/mL). These findings suggest that the anti-cholinergic properties of Polypodium vulgare contribute to Digestodoron®'s efficacy. Its ability to relax colonic muscle strips and reduce inflammation highlights its potential as a therapeutic agent for gastrointestinal motility disorders and IBD.",

    "abstract": "Homeopathy can be used as a complementary tratamento in psychiatric conditions that are difficult to manage or are associated with significant efeitos adversos from conventional therapies. This is a relato de caso of a 37-year-old woman, married, mother of an 18-month-old child, living in a low-income area, treated at a Primary Health Care (PHC) unit within the Brazilian Public Health Care System. At the time of consultation, she was breastfeeding and taking haloperidol 2mg/ml (20 drops at night) and sertraline 200 mg/day. The antipsychotic had been switched from risperidone to haloperidol during pregnancy due to contraindications related to pregnancy and breastfeeding. Despite the medication, she continued to experience the following persistent symptoms: persecutory thoughts, visual and auditory hallucinations, suicidal ideation, mood swings, and affective blunting. She complained of intense drowsiness and also observed drowsiness in her daughter after breastfeeding. She felt unable to carry out her daily activities. The patient has a diagnosis of depressão with psychotic symptoms, made by psychiatrist, for over five years. An individualized homeopathic tratamento was proposed with the goal of relieving psychiatric symptoms and enabling a reduction in conventional medications. Hyosciamus niger 5LM was prescribed twice daily, with a follow-up appointment scheduled for 30 days. At follow-up, the patient reported significant improvement, with a marked reduction in the frequency of psychotic symptoms. On her own initiative, she reduced haloperidol to 10 drops and reported less drowsiness and no suicidal ideation. She experienced mild episodes at the beginning of homeopathic tratamento, which were managed using the \"plus\" method, as instructed. She resumed social activities. Based on this progress, a gradual withdrawal plan for haloperidol was developed and successfully implemented. The patient was monitored over a period of one and a half years, with bimonthly consultations. She remained off haloperidol, and the sertraline dose was reduced to 150 mg/day. During periods when she stopped using the homeopathic remedy, there was a recurrence of symptoms, which subsided once she resumed regular use. This case highlights the potential of homeopatia in the complementary management of refractory mental symptoms, even in patients taking high doses of conventional antidepressants and antipsychotics. Its main advantage is the absence of side effects typically caused by conventional medications, allowing its use even in situations such as pregnancy and breastfeeding. As a relato de caso, it presents a number needed to treat (NNT) of one, demonstrating high clinical efetividade. The main limitation was the lack of validated tools for quantifying symptoms before and after the intervenção.¹ ² This case shows that homeopatia can be a valuable complementary therapeutic resource, promoting symptom control, reducing efeitos adversos of psychotropic drugs, and improving qualidade de vida.",

    "abstract": "Long COVID affects a significant portion of COVID-19 survivors, causing debilitating symptoms that persist for months or even years. This case highlights a previously healthy 35-year-old woman with severe neurocognitive dysfunction and fatigue following COVID-19, who made a remarkable recovery using integrative therapies, including diet modifications, phytonutrients, and neuromodulation techniques. Her case contributes to the understanding of potential therapeutic options for Long COVID, particularly in addressing complex neurocognitive and autonomic dysfunctions. A 35-year-old ICU nurse with no significant past medical history contracted COVID-19 in January 2023. She experienced initial symptoms of headache, fever, fatigue, and prolonged sleep (18 hours daily). After a 5-day course of Paxlovid, fever resolved, but other symptoms persisted.By September 2023, she developed severe neurocognitive symptoms, including dizziness, memory loss, speech deficits, and vertigo. *January 2023: Contracts COVID *September 2023: Develops severe neurocognitive symptoms, including dizziness, memory loss, speech deficits, and vertigo. She was eventually diagnosed with Long COVID, characterized by complex vertebrobasilar migraines, dysautonomia (POTS), and post-viral autoimmune encephalitis. Becomes medically disabled. *October 2023: Begins tratamento at UCSFs Osher Center for Long COVID, receiving a combination of conventional and integrative intervençãos. *May 2024: Patient returns to work part-time. Stellate Ganglionic Nerve Block (SGB) #1 *December 2024: SGB #2- not effective (inexperienced provider) *March 2025: SBG#3- 99% improvement, returns to full-time work New TGLB antibodies, CRP elevated, B2 (Riboflavin) low, Vit D low, ferritin low Vibrant antibody testing: 19 brain auto-antibodies present, confirming diagnosis of post-viral autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Treatment included the use of CGRP antagonists for migraine relief, supplements (iron, riboflavin, vitamins D and C, zinc, perilla, quercetin), and neuromodulation with TransVagal Nerve Stimulation (TVNS). She followed a lectin-free, anti-inflammatory diet. After three stellate ganglionic nerve blocks, she experienced complete symptom resolution. Botox and LDN (low-dose naltrexone) were used to manage migraine severity and systemic inflammation, leading to significant improvement in fatigue, brain fog, and neurocognitive deficits. One year later, the patient achieved 95% recovery and returned to full-time work. Follow-up tests showed improved inflammatory markers (CRP, TGLB antibodies). The second SBG was not effective and caused phrenic nerve paralysis. This case underscores the efetividade of a multi-faceted, integrative approach to managing severe Long COVID, highlighting the role of neuromodulation, dietary changes, and targeted supplements in reversing debilitating post-viral symptoms. The patients near-total recovery supports the potential for similar therapeutic intervençãos in Long COVID patients, though personalized tratamento remains key. TVNS and Ganglionic nerve blocks, particularly when administered by experienced providers, may offer a valuable intervenção for dysautonomia. Key Takeaways:  Post-COVID neuro-encephalomyelitis and dysautonomia are serious complications of Long COVID that can be effectively managed with a combination of conventional and integrative tratamentos.  Integrative approaches, including diet, nutraceuticals, and neuromodulation, can significantly improve resultados in severe cases of Long COVID.  Ganglionic nerve blocks show promise as a terapia for reversing dysautonomia, though resultados can vary depending on provider expertise",

Stable CD4 count, undetectable viral load, normal WBC and lymphocyte levels. Eosinophils are slightly increased; warrants monitoring. Patient verbally confirmed adherence to the supplement regimen. No adverse events were reported from acupuntura or supplements. Transfer Factor, a protein complex derived from bovine colostrum, is thought to support immune function by enhancing T-cell activity and transferring immune memory. Though not included in standard HIV tratamento guidelines, it has shown potential in boosting immune markers like CD4 counts. In this case, a patient added Transfer Factor (125 mg twice daily) to her ART regimen (Symtuza) for three months. Her CD4 count increased from 607.43 to 665.87 cells/uL, with an undetectable viral load and no efeitos adversos. While scientific support is limited to small studies and anecdotal evidence, this case suggests Transfer Factor can be safely integrated into HIV care, promoting a more patient-centered, holistic tratamento approach.",

    "abstract": "This relato de caso highlights the potential role of integrative Ayurvedic tratamentos in managing multiple myeloma, a hematological malignancy commonly treated with chemoterapia and bone marrow transplant. The patient, diagnosed in December 2020, showed a partial response to chemoterapia but declined a bone marrow transplant in August 2021. He continued with conventional tratamento, including Bortezomib and Zoledronic acid, while initiating Ayurvedic terapia for symptom management and systemic support. By 2022, the patient remained clinically stable. This case suggests that a well-coordinated, patient-centered approach combining conventional oncology and Ayurveda may offer promising resultados in select patients with advanced disease. A 68-year-old male, diagnosed with multiple myeloma in December 2020, sought Ayurvedic tratamento in August 2021 due to partial relief from chemoterapia and corticosteroids, which caused efeitos adversos. The patient had a history of hypertension for 16 years and no other significant medical or family history. His primary concerns included significant weight loss, fatigue, and bone pain. Physical examination revealed general weakness, pallor, and tenderness over bony prominences. After diagnosis in Dec 2020 and partial response to chemoterapia, the patient declined bone marrow transplant in Aug 2021 but continued regular hematology follow-up, receiving Inj. Bortezomib and Zoledronic acid. Alongside, he initiated Ayurvedic terapia for symptom management and systemic support. By 2022, he was clinically stable, reflecting a well-coordinated integrative approach between conventional oncology and Ayurvedic care. Laboratory tests showed anemia (hemoglobin: 7.3 g/dL), renal dysfunction (serum creatinine: 3.43 mg/dL), and low serum calcium (7.8 mg/dL). PET-CT confirmed multiple lytic lesions consistent with multiple myeloma, and bone marrow biopsy revealed plasma cell infiltration. The patient's disease was staged as ISS Stage III. Diagnostic challenges included the patients refusal of further conventional tratamentos, highlighting cultural and financial barriers. The patient followed an Ayurvedic regimen comprising HirakRasayana (125 mg, twice daily) for immune support, Panchatikta Ghruta Guggul (250 mg, thrice daily) for bone health, Kukutandtwaka Bhasma (125 mg, morning) for supporting bone health, and Dadimavaleha (10 ml, twice daily) for anti-inflammatory benefits. These tratamentos were adjusted based on the patient's progress and tolerance. Follow-up showed significant symptom improvement, with the patient reporting reduced fatigue, weight gain, and improved qualidade de vida. Laboratory results indicated stable hemoglobin levels and improved kidney function. The patient adhered to the Ayurvedic regimen without significant efeitos adversos. This case demonstrates the potential for Ayurvedic tratamentos to improve the qualidade de vida in patients with multiple myeloma, especially when conventional therapies are limited or not preferred. However, limitations exist, including the lack of controlled ensaio clínicos to support Ayurvedic efficacy in hematologic malignancies. More research is needed to validate the segurança and efetividade of Ayurvedic approaches in such conditions.",

    "abstract": "Sjogrens syndrome is a slow progressive autoimmune disorder characterized by the inflammation of the exocrine glands due to lymphocytic infiltration. Classical symptoms of Sjogrens are xerostomia, keratoconjunctivitis sicca and fatigue involving inflammation of lacrimal and salivary glands. Despite of its common occurrence, tratamento options have been limited to symptomatic management, glucocorticoids and immunosuppressive drugs. A case of 42-year-old female reported with Cevimeline (cholinergic agonist) dependency, previously diagnosed with Sjogrens syndrome in 2020 and symptomatic presentations since 2015. Patients primary concerns were decreased salivation and lacrimation, neck pain, severe dryness of eye, mouth and vagina. Based on the symptomatic presentation, patient was diagnosed to be one of the diseases of vata dosha aggravation (vatavyadhi) along with dryness of eyes (shushka akshipaka) and lymphatic channels (Udakavaha sroto dushti). Patient was treated with oral ayurved medicines and panchakarma tratamento during the period of 7 October, 2023 to 30 November, 2024. Patient was diagnosed in 2020 as Sjoregn's syndrome in California, USA Assessment Parameters used for clinical evaluation of symptoms Dryness of eyes Xerostomia (dryness of mouth) Dryness of vagina Neck pain Cramps in calf muscles Loss of appetite Strength of patient Treatment was mainly emphasized on stopping or avoiding causative factors (nidana parivarjan), cleansing of channels (sroto shodhan) and pacification of dosha using internal herbal medications (shaman). Through medicated enema (oil and decoction  alternate days) for cleansing of channels (sroto shodhan) was attained followed by medicated milk enema (Ashwagandhadi ksheera basti) for nourishment (dhatu poshan). Vasanta kusumakara ras and Swarnamalini Vasanta ras were given as Rasayana (for rejuvenation). The above regime resulted in a promising resultado where patients could overcome her Cevimeline dependency with significant relief from symptoms and a much-improved qualidade de vida. This case highlights the potential of Ayurvedic intervenção with emphasis on detoxification and tissue rejuvenation that has led to marked relief of symptoms in Sjogrens syndrome and reduced the dependency on conventional medication, while enhancing overall qualidade de vida.",

    "abstract": "The standard criterion for treating stroke starts with the needed acute management and intensive rehabilitation, but it still cannot achieve total recovery. This highlights the pressing need for a more holistic and comprehensive strategy. Traditional Ayurveda tratamento integrated with Yoga and physioterapia shows promising benefits in ischemic/ haemorrhagic stroke management in sub-acute to chronic stages. The integrative approach accelerates recovery and improves qualidade de vida in patients with ischemic and haemorrhagic shock. We describe a 62-year-old male patient with bilateral Gangliocapsular and Thalamic infarcts, with a 3-month history, treated conservatively. He is a known case of Type 2 Diabetes and Systemic Hypertension. The initial assessment of the patient revealed a Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of 3, indicating moderate disability, and a Barthel Index score of 60, reflecting a need for assistance in daily living activities. The Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) was recorded as grade 3 in the left upper and lower limbs, indicating considerable spasticity. The patient suffered a stroke in November 2023. In February, he was admitted to our hospital. We planned seven days of Pottali massage, 8 days of Sirodhara, and 8 days of Pizhichil. Diagnosis was confirmed by CT brain revealing bilateral Gangliocapsular and Thalamic infarcts. Ayurvedic assessment was done with Daavidhapareeksha. After the patient reached a post-recovery plateau, an integrative tratamento approach was planned, combining traditional Ayurvedic therapies, Yoga, and physioterapia. We structured this holistic regimen in phases over twenty-four days. The therapeutic strategy aimed to enhance neurological recovery, functional independence, and overall well-being. Clinical assessment tools, including the Modified Rankin Scale (mRS), Modified Barthel Index (MBI), and Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS), were employed to monitor and evaluate the patient's progress throughout the tratamento and follow-up period. At baseline, the patient had a Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of 3 and a Barthel Index (BI) score of 60, indicating moderate disability and partial dependence for daily activities. The Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) was recorded as grade 3 in the left upper and lower limbs, indicating considerable spasticity. Following the integrative tratamento, the MAS score improved to grade 2, reflecting an improvement in muscle tone. The patient also demonstrated notable improvements in cognitive function and showed independence in daily activities. The patient's gains were consistent during follow-up assessments conducted at one, two, and six months post-tratamento. No serious efeitos adversos were observed during or after the intervenção. An integrative approach, including Ayurvedic tratamento, yoga, and physioterapia, helps relieve myofascial release, relieve flexion synergy, and strengthen the muscles. The sustained improvements in motor function, muscle tone and overall functional independence suggest that such a multidisciplinary strategy can offer meaningful recovery beyond conventional care. Further research is warranted to confirm these findings, which can contribute to the development of standardised integrative protocols for stroke rehabilitation.",

    "abstract": "According to the Global Burden of Disease Study, in 2020, low back pain (LBP) affected 619 million people and was the leading cause of disability globally. A 66-year-old female presented with chronic LBP of two years duration. Pain limited her endurance capacity for walking, sitting for prolonged periods, and climbing steps. At the initial Ayurveda consultation, the patient reported severe pain throughout the past week. The pain intensity was rated as nine to ten while walking, and seven to eight while at rest on a numeric pain scale from zero to ten. The patient reported that the pain intensity increased during the early morning, in cold weather, when walking, and when sitting for long periods. Laying down reduced the pain intensity. The patient had no history of trauma, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, allergies, hypertension, or diabetes. She reported using nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) as painkillers during episodes of severe pain (one 500 mg tablet of ibuprofen). An Oswestry Disability Index score of 55% at the initial Ayurveda consultation indicated severe disability. The Ayurvedic examination revealed severe pain, stiffness, rigidity in the lower back, irregular appetite, and constipation, which indicated Vata imbalance. The Ayurvedic diagnosis was Kati Shoola. The patient received eight weeks of Ayurvedic tratamento. The above symptoms clearly indicate Vata aggravation. The vitiated Vata dosha has likely become localized in the Kati pradesha (lower back), resulting in Katishoola (low back pain). The patients lifestyle further confirms this imbalance of Vata. These cumulative influences support the pathogenesis of Vata prakopa and its localization, ultimately manifesting as Katishoola. Holistic Ayurvedic tratamento principles include local oil application and sudation terapia with a specific herbal oil, internal administration of herbs, dietary and lifestyle modifications, and yoga to help reduce pain and improve mobility. Patient received an Ayurvedic terapia called Katibasti once a week for eight weeks. In addition, the patient was instructed to take two pills of Kaishora Guggulu (450 mg) and two pills of Yogaraja Guggulu (450 mg) twice a day with hot water after breakfast and dinner. Dashamoola decoction with eranda Taila twice a day was also given for eight weeks. The patients low back pain almost completely resolved over the course of eight weeks with holistic Ayurvedic tratamento protocols. At the end of the fourth week of tratamento the patient rated their pain at five out of ten while walking, and at two to three out of ten while resting. By the end of the eighth week the patient rated her pain at zero to two out of ten while walking and at zero while resting. In this relato de caso, a patient experiencing severe, chronic LBP received Ayurvedic tratamentos, including Katibasti, herbal supplements, and diet and lifestyle recommendations including yoga over the course of eight weeks. Kaishore Guggulu is traditionally used to support healthy joints, muscles and connective tissues.Yogaraja Guggulu is an Ayurvedic formula commonly used to treat Vata Vyadhis (diseases), including musculoskeletal disorders and arthritis.",

    "abstract": "Urinary incontinence (UI) is a prevalent and burdensome condition affecting postmenopausal women. Studies show 25% - 45% of middle-aged or older women experience UI annually, with 15% reporting daily leakage. This case explores acupuntura and Transcutaneous Electric Nerve Stimulation (TENS) as therapeutic intervençãos for UI. It also examines parallels between Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) acupoints and the anatomical targets of Percutaneous Tibial Nerve Stimulation (PTNS), a modern urologic tratamento derived from acupuntura. A 66-year-old female with hypertension, pre-diabetes, stress UI, and chronic low back pain presented to the UCLA Center for East West Medicine with worsening stress UI after menopause. She had two vaginal births and tried pelvic floor exercises without improvement. Patient received weekly to biweekly acupuntura, then monthly maintenance after improvement. Milestones: 9/25/24 - First acupuntura 10/9/24  3-4 days of UI improvement 10/30/24  Longer relief; started TENS 12/18/24  TENS twice daily; one UI episode in between visits 6/25/25  No leakage with coughing/sneezing; continued TENS The patient never saw a urologist for formal evaluation, but her symptoms were consistent with stress UI with leakage several times a day from coughing, sneezing, and exercise. Retrospective ICIQ-UI SF score before tratamento was 9. TCM assessment revealed a pale tongue with cracks and teeth marks, consistent with Kidney-Yin and Qi deficiency. Physician-administered acupuntura included LI4/LV3/ST36/KD3/SP6/SP9/SP10/SI3/UB62 points with needles retained 20 minutes/session. Patient instructed to use home TENS unit over SP6/KD3/SP9. The patient noted symptom improvement after one session, with longer-lasting relief over time. UI episodes decreased from multiple times daily to once weekly, with no leakage during coughing, sneezing, or exercise. Post-tratamento ICIQ-UI SF score improved to 3. TENS adherence was high with no adverse events reported. This case highlights the use of TCM-based acupuntura in treating UI, showing symptom improvement through neuromodulation. Several acupoints used align with the course of the posterior tibial nerve, the same target used in PTNS, a minimally invasive tratamento involving electric needle stimulation near the ankle and foot. Though acupuntura has long been used for UI, contemporary studies of PTNS have shown that stimulating the posterior tibial nerve modulates sacral nerve pathways (S2-S4), which play a key role in bladder function. In this case, both in-clinic acupuntura and home TENS unit were used to stimulate similar anatomical regions, resulting in substantial improvement in UI symptoms. PTNS is a third-line terapia per U.S urologic guidelines, typically reserved for refractory cases. However, this case raises the question of whether acupuntura and TENS could be introduced earlier in the tratamento guidelines, which may reduce the need for pharmacologic or invasive intervençãos, improve patient resultados, and broaden access to care. However, this is a single case, and larger studies are needed to evaluate these findings.",

    "abstract": "Fibromyalgia causes widespread musculoskeletal pain and is more common in women aged 35 to 44. It has no defined etiology and may have more than one causative factor. Physioterapia seeks to provide a better qualidade de vida through resources such as laser, which can be associated with auriculoterapia as laser puncture, and radiofrequency, promoting analgesia and muscle relaxation. Women with a clinical diagnosis of FM, over 18 years of age, who presented preserved thermal sensitivity in the bilateral upper trapezius region, who were able to travel to the research site and agreed to sign the Free and Consentimento Informado Form (FICF) participated in the study. The participants were divided into two groups, called G1 (application of radiofrequency in the upper trapezius) and G2 (application of radiofrequency in the upper trapezius associated with auricular laser puncture), following the order of confirmation of participation after the physioterapia evaluation was completed. In the first session, the volunteers were evaluated, and between the 2nd and 9th sessions, the therapeutic application was performed weekly. In the last session, the reevaluation was performed, totaling 10 meetings. During the evaluation, identification and anamnesis data were collected, as well as physical examination of tender points that were painful upon palpation and thermal sensitivity testing in the upper trapezius region, bilaterally. Pain indices were also assessed using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). The degree of functionality was assessed using the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ). Anxiety and depressão levels were measured using the Beck inventories (BDI and BAI). The tratamento of group G1 consisted of radiofrequency application with a tetrapolar handle in a temperature range between 35ºC and 37ºC. The application time was 5 minutes in an area of 100cm2. For the tratamento of group G2, radiofrequency was applied, associated with low-intensity laser at a wavelength of 660nm with a dose of 4 Joules, continuous mode, at an incidence angle of 90º, for a time defined by the equipment, which was 8s in the auricular points. Eight female subjects diagnosed with FM participated in the study and were divided into two groups: G1 (n=4) and G2 (n=4). The sample consisted of women aged between 28 and 61 years. Among the comorbidities present, in addition to FM, the following stood out: depressão (n=5), rheumatic diseases (n=5), heart problems (n=3), thyroid disorders (n=3), ansiedade (n=2), dyslipidemia (n=2) and lupus (n=1). The intervençãos performed with radiofrequency and laserpuncture demonstrated positive results in the levels of pain, ansiedade and depressão, although no statistically significant improvement was obtained in these variables. The reduction in the total values obtained in the FIQ questionnaire in G1 is noteworthy, which represents an improvement in the functionality of these individuals. Although G2 received a combination of radiofrequency and laserpuncture, no statistical difference was evidenced in the parameters evaluated.",

    "abstract": "Guillain-Barre syndrome is a condition in which the body's immune system attacks the part of the peripheral nervous system. The syndrome can affect the nerves that control muscle movement as well as those that transmit pain, temperature and touch sensations. This can result in muscle weakness, loss of sensation in the limbs, numbness or paralysis and problems swallowing or breathing. Weakness and tingling in the hands and feet are usually the first symptoms. These sensations can quickly spread and may lead to paralysis. Guillain-Barre syndrome is rare, and the exact cause is not known. Two-thirds of people have symptoms of an infection in the six weeks before Guillain-Barre symptoms begin which includes respiratory or a gastrointestinal infection, including COVID-19. Guillain-Barre also can be caused by the Zika virus. There's no known cure for Guillain-Barre syndrome. Several tratamento options can ease symptoms and help speed recovery. Most people recover from Guillain-Barre syndrome, but some serious illnesses can be fatal. In Ayurveda, this condition considered as Sarvangavatam. Due to particular Nidana, the aggravated Vata affects the whole body and reflected as Balakshaya, Cheshtahani, Stabdhata, Gatrasphurana, Gatra bhanjana etc. Vatavyadhi Chikitsa in the form of Snehana, Swedana, Vasthi etc will be helpful. Along with this, the supporting therapies like Physioterapia, Yoga and Meditation will fasten the recovery. A 62 years old female patient complaining of weakness of all the four limbs, stiffness of hands, tremors in hands, numbness of palms & foot, hyperesthesia of legs, pain over low back & knee joints. She was under medication for Hypertension & Hypercholesteremia and had history of recurrent UTI. There was no relevant family history. During the examination, it was found out that Muscle power was RUL  3/5, LUL  2/5, RLL  1/5, LLL-2/5, exaggerated plantar reflex, Hypotonic muscles and hyperesthesia of RLL. 25.8.2024  Felt difficulty in climbing stairs. 26.8.2024  Complete weakness of Left hand & Right leg, weakness of all limbs by noon.

    "abstract": "Ayurveda, an ancient system of medicine in India, offers a holistic approach to health and wellness. When applied to Autism, Ayurveda emphasizes individualized tratamento plans that balance the body's Doshas through diet, herbal remedies, lifestyle modifications, and therapies like Panchakarma. This approach aims to address both physical and mental imbalances, which are believed to contribute to Autism spectrum disorders (ASD). In this relato de caso presentation of an interesting case of autism, not responding to the conventional protocol in modern medicine, managed with Integrated Ayurvedic tratamento. A 5 year-old male patient came to our hospital with complaints of difficulty in conversations, delayed speech development, poor social interaction, poor eye contact, repetitive hand movements, hyperactivity and not interested in peer group play. Month 0 (Start) Initiation of Integrated Ayurvedic tratamento Month 1 Improvement in eye contact and reduction in hyperactivity Month 3 Noticeable improvements in speech clarity and social response Month 6 ISAA score decreased significantly; better sleep patterns noted Month 9 Continued improvements in behavioral and cognitive domains Month 12 Marked improvement in overall functioning; ISAA reassessment showed sustained progress Indian scale for assessment of autism (ISAA) test manual was used to diagnose the condition. Ayurvedic Intervenção Terapêutica External Ayurveda therapies Speech Therapy Occupational terapia A good response to tratamento was noticed. The digestive and bowel complaints were relieved and considerable improvement noticed in communication skills and hyperactivity. ISAA score was reduced to 115 from 127. According to Ayurveda, disorders such as ASD are believed to result from the improper functioning of mental faculties. Ayurveda views the mind and body as an integrated unit. The imbalance of TridoshasVata, Pitta, and Kapha in the body, and Sattva, Rajas, and Tamas in the mindis considered the root cause of various diseases. In this case, the tratamento protocol aimed to restore balance in these doshas, with particular focus on improving gut health, enhancing cognitive function, and regulating behavioral symptoms. Ayurvedic therapies were integrated with supportive intervençãos like Occupational Therapy (OT) and Speech Therapy to form a holistic and individualized tratamento plan. The ISSA assessment score results are as follows: Social Relationship and Reciprocity-reduced to 31(AT) from 34(BT), Emotional Responsiveness-reduced to 18(AT) from 19(BT), Speech-Language and Communication-reduced to 22(AT) from 24(BT), Behaviour Patterns-reduced to 26(AT) from 28(BT), Sensory Aspects-reduced to 10(AT) from 12(BT) and Cognitive Component-reduced to 8(AT) from 10(BT)..This integrative approach contributed to notable improvements in both behavioral symptoms and functional abilities, as well as in ISAA scores. It underscores the value of Ayurvedic insights into disease pathogenesis and individualized tratamento planning. Furthermore, it highlights the urgent need for systematic clinical studies and baseado em evidence research to validate and strengthen the role of Ayurveda in the management of neurodevelopmental disorders like ASD.",

    "abstract": "Sleep problems are one of the most common medical complaints. Lack of sleep is associated with significantly decreased work performance, impaired daytime function, and increased healthcare costs. Insomnia is the most prevalent sleep disorder wherein the patient experiences difficulty initiating and maintaining sleep, along with non -refreshing sleep. It adversely affects a person's professional life, physical and mental health as well as overall qualidade de vida. Constant stress can be a factor. The most serious impact of insomnia is increased risk of depressão. Mindfulness, as an important component of yoga, improves sleep disturbance by increasing melatonin levels, reducing hyperarousal, and addressing stress related cardiac and respiratory abnormalities. Although there have been research studies in the past exploring the effect of yoga on psychophysiological disorders, there is a dearth of research involving integrated terapia approach. A 58-year-old female, self-employed, presented with musculoskeletal pain and insomnia at Vaidyaratnam nursing home. This case study was undertaken to explore the add on effect of yoga in ansiedade disorders and insomnia. The patient was assessed on day 1 and after completion of 14 days terapia for Sleep Quality and Quality of life by using standard questionnaires. The patient underwent yoga and Ayurveda tratamento for 14 days at Vaidyaratnam Nursing Home, Thaikkattussery. The case was taken as insomnia with the support of insomnia screening questionnaire. Pittsburgh sleep quality index assessed sleep quality and disturbances over 1-month time interval. Also WHOQOL-BREF questionnaire for denoting qualidade de vida. The Insomnia screening questionnaire shows the score of 24, which shows there is Insomnia in patient. PSQI score shows 9, which indicates poor sleep quality. T The condition was managed with the practice of yoga and meditação for twenty minutes twice daily. Initial three days was taken for teaching and self-practice. The patient was assessed on day 1 and after completion of 14 days terapia for Sleep Quality and Quality of life by using standard questionnaires. Sleep diary was maintained by the patient as per request to assess the change of sleep pattern. The results of present case study revealed significant reduction in stress, and improved qualidade de vida after 14 days of yoga and Ayurvedic intervenção. The patient also showed reduction in musculoskeletal pain which was sustained even after 2 months. Thus, an integrative terapia of yoga and Ayurveda can be implemented in patients suffering from insomnia. The patient showed significant improvement which might be due to the fact that yoga practices lead to progressive muscle relaxation along with calming the mind. It is evident from earlier studies that yoga asanas and guided relaxation techniques influence autonomic nervous system wherein parasympathetic activity is increased and sympathetic activity is decreased.",

    "abstract": "Auriculoterapia using Nogier frequencies was applied as a complementary intervenção in a 56-year-old woman treated for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the posterior lateral border of the tongue. This case is unique in demonstrating functional recovery from radioterapia-induced sequelaexerostomia, dysgeusia, dysphagia, and trismusthrough auricular stimulation targeting specific cranial nerve reflex points. The patient underwent surgical resection of the tumor, left cervical lymph node dissection, and submandibular gland removal. Postoperatively, she developed xerostomia, altered taste, nausea, and reduced swallowing capacity. After 66 days, she began 30 sessions of intensity-modulated radioterapia (IMRT). Symptoms worsened progressively with radioterapia, particularly xerostomia and dysgeusia. She had no relevant genetic history or comorbidities. The tongues posterior mobility was significantly reduced. -A timeline of intervenção began 37 days after radioterapia ended. Four auriculoterapia sessions were performed, spaced according to symptom recurrence. At each session, electrical detection identified reactive points on the ear corresponding to cranial nerves V, VII, IX, X, and XII. After auricular preparation using Frequencies D and L, therapeutic Frequencies A (2.28 Hz), B (5.56 Hz), and C (9.12 Hz) were applied to each responsive point for 5 seconds each. Diagnosis: Tongue (biopsy of lateral border); Squamous cell carcinoma The first session resulted in resolution of nausea, return of appetite, and recovery of acidic and bitter taste. Xerostomia improved enough to reduce the use of artificial saliva. By the second session, gag reflex had returned, dysgeusia improved, and dysphagia slightly decreased. After the third session, the patient noted facial relaxation, and for the first time, cranial nerve V was responsive. Trismus symptoms lessened. By the fourth session, nearly all taste modalities were restored, and swallowing improved. This case illustrates how auriculoterapia with Nogier frequencies may offer effective support in oncologic rehabilitation. Sustained symptom relief and improved oral function suggest neural modulation via auricular pathways. Results support integrating auriculoterapia as a non-invasive adjunct to manage radioterapia sequelae in head and neck cancer. This case reinforces auriculoterapia as a promising complementary approach for addressing post-radioterapia complications in head and neck cancer. By stimulating specific auricular zones corresponding to cranial nerves involved in oral functions, improvements were observed in taste, saliva production, swallowing, and facial tension. The use of Nogier frequencies may have contributed to cellular repair and neuromodulation. While the effects cannot be solely attributed to auriculoterapia, the observed improvements highlight its therapeutic potential.",

    "abstract": "Since 2006, Tai Chi Chuan (Taijiquan, TJQ) has been recognized by Brazils saúde pública system as a complementary terapia. Few studies have examined its effects on heart rate variability (HRV), a key marker of autonomic nervous system (ANS) and psychological health. Evidences from 2014 to 2024 suggests TJQ may improve HRV and reduce depressive symptoms. This relato de caso assessed TJQs impact on HRV and qualidade de vida in a Brazilian adult after a four-week intervenção. 39-year-old Brazilian Caucasian cisgender woman with prior TJQ experience. BMI: 27.61 kg/m². She reported no tobacco or alcohol use and had a medical diagnosis of ansiedade (CID F41.1) and depressão (CID F33) under pharmacological and psychiatric management since 2014. Baseline data were collected on 03/27/24, and final assessments were completed on 04/20/24 in a four-week supervised TJQ program. Before and after intervenção, the WHOQOL-BREF applied, blood pressure (analogic sphygmomanometer), body composition (bioimpedance scale), and abdominal circumference (tape measure) measured. HRV data were recorded using a Polar H10 chest strap paired with the Elite HRV app during all 8 sessions and analyzed using Kubios HRV software. The intervenção consisted of two times per week 85-minuteTJQ sessions: 5' initial relaxation, 15' preparatory exercises (Fang Song and Ba Duan Jin), 30' correct technique instruction, and 30' practice Yang-style forms (8; 16), and 5'post-session. She maintained her usual routine. After four weeks of TJQ practice, the participant showed improvements in physiological, psychological, and anthropometric measures. Resting HR decreased from 85 to 80 bpm, and blood pressure shifted from 136/78 to 128/90 mmHg. Body weight slightly dropped (63.8 to 63.0 kg), fat mass reduced (41.2 to 36.9 kg), and lean mass increased (25.2 to 28.0 kg). Abdominal circumference decreased from 90 to 88.5 cm. HRV analysis indicated better ANS regulation: mean HR (94 to 86 bpm), RMSSD rose (12.9 to 49.2 ms), SNS index declined (3.92 to 0.81), and stress index dropped (21.9 to 7.3), rise in HF (236.82 to 1254.6 ms²) that suggested heightened parasympathetic activation during TJQ practice. WHOQOL-BREF psychological scores improved (63 to 69), while physical and social domains stayed stable; environment scores decreased (56 to 50). No adverse events were reported. This relato de caso highlights the specific improvements of ANS regulation, psychological well-being, and body composition in a 39-year-old woman with depressão. After four weeks of supervised practice, HRV analysis indicated increased parasympathetic activity, reduced sympathetic tone, and lower stress levels. Psychological health improved, while physical health and social relationship scores remained stable; a slight decline in the environmental score may not be intervenção-related. Reductions in anthropometry suggest positive changes in body composition. These findings align with existing research on TJQs benefits for ANS balance and emotional regulation. Further studies are needed to confirm these effects and define clinical protocols. Acknowledgments: UFOP and FAPEMIG.",

    "abstract": "Mid-portion Achilles tendinopathy has increased in recent decades, presenting significant challenges in tratamento. While physical terapia is considered the as gold standard, additional therapeutic options are needed since physical terapia is not always successful and for those who cannot tolerate the physical exercises. This relato de caso describes a chronic mid-portion Achilles tendinopathy in the right leg of an 80-year-old Caucasian male patient. The patient had a 2.5 cm leg length discrepancy caused by a tibial fracture at age 31. At the initial consultation, the patient reported recurring right Achilles tendon pain for over 12 months. This persisted despite an orthopaedic footwear adjustment 8 months prior. The tratamento and follow-up described in this report took place over the following 2.5 years. Pain was rated at 5-6/10 on the visual analogue scale, which significantly limited his leisure time and daily activities. Initial assessment was an external clinical assessment. Clinical evaluations during terapia showed minimal tenderness at the distal Achilles tendon insertion, with no swelling or redness. An orthopaedic footwear adjustment had been made 8 months prior to consultation. Initial medical tratamento had included symptomatic analgesia, which the patient was not utilizing at the time of consultation. An integrative injection terapia with Tendo/Allium cepa was initiated, administered subcutaneously three times per week. Concurrently, the patient performed regular physioterapia exercises and applied a daily local ointment (comfrey anti-inflammatory, Stannum met praep 0.4%), though the ointment provided no additional benefits. A temporary switch to Symphytum comp yielded equivalent results to the Tendo/Allium cepa injections. Over 2.5 years, the injection terapia demonstrated good therapeutic efficacy, with symptoms consistently resolving after 2-3 weeks of tratamento. Symptom-free intervals with injection terapia alone averaged several weeks. Regular physioterapia exercises extended these symptom-free intervals but could not maintain symptom relief on their own. Withdrawal trials confirmed a usage-effect correlation without requiring adjustments to the injection dose or frequency. The injection terapia was tolerated with no efeitos adversos. This relato de caso describes the efficacy of Tendo/Allium cepa comp in treating chronic mid-portion Achilles tendinopathy. It also suggests additional benefits in extending symptom-free intervals when combined with physioterapia exercises. The positive resultado confirms the therapeutic potential of the injection terapia. Further clinical studies are needed to evaluate the broader therapeutic effects and optimal application methods (subcutaneous vs. oral) of Tendo/Allium cepa comp in chronic mid-portion Achilles tendinopathy.",

    "abstract": "Tai Chi Chun (Taquijan, TQJ) is a safe, and low-impact mind-body practice that integrates rhythmic movement, breathing, and relaxation¹. In Brazil, TJQ is recognized as an Integrative and Complementary Health Practice within the Unified Health System². Regular TJQ has been linked to improved autonomic regulation, including greater respiratory amplitude and emotional control³. However, differences in heart rate variability (HRV)which reflects the balance between the sympathetic (SNS) and parasympathetic (PNS) nervous systemsbetween experienced and beginner practitioners remain underexplored. This study assessed autonomic effects of TJQ across experience levels, focusing on parasympathetic adaptations from sustained practice. Participant A: 39-year-old man; 1.67 m; 70 kg; 26 years of TJQ. Participant B: 25-year-old woman; 1.56 m; 50 kg; beginner with 6 months intermittent practice of TJQ. In April 2025, HRV data were collected from both participants, with recordings taken 5 minutes before and after each individual's 75-minute Yang-style session. HRV data were recorded using a Polar H10 chest strap synchronized with the Elite HRV app. Analysis was performed with Kubios software, assessing autonomic balance via RMSSD (Root Mean Square of Successive Differences), SDNN (Standard Deviation of NN intervals), NN50 (Number of successive NN intervals that differ by more than 50 ms), and pNN50 (Percentage of NN50) parameters, where NN is the normal intervals between heartbeats. The TJQ class followed a structured sequence: 5 minutes of joint mobilization, 15 minutes of Ba Duan Jin (focused on controlled breathing), 30 minutes of Yang-style techniques, and 25 minutes practicing the 8- and 16-form sequences. The experienced practitioner showed high PNS modulation post-session, with RMSSD 45.6 ms (a time-domain HRV index reflecting vagally mediated parasympathetic control), positive PNS index (0.14), and negative SNS index (-0.42), indicating parasympathetic dominance linked to physiological and emotional well-being. In contrast, the beginner showed lower PNS activity (RMSSD 40.7 ms, PNS -1.11, SNS 1.44), indicating sympathetic dominance and reduced autonomic flexibility. The SNS index reflects sympathetic load. Thus, long-term practice appears necessary for greater autonomic improvements. This relato de caso suggests that TJQ practice improves autonomic controlespecially in experienced practitionersby enhancing PNS modulation and balancing SNS activity, supporting the idea that regular exercise lowers SNS activity and increases vagal tone over time. As reduced vagal function is linked to higher morbidity and mortality, intervençãos that enhance autonomic balance are important. Combined with prior evidence that regular TJQ increases HRV and parasympathetic activity, this report reinforces that long-term practice drives the adaptations needed for maximal autonomic benefit.",

    "abstract": "The advent of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) has transformed metastatic Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma (ccRCC) management, yet patients with autoimmune comorbidities face therapeutic limitations due to immune-related adverse event risks. This creates a critical need for complementary approaches that address disease progression while managing qualidade de vida. We present a case using protocol of complementary medicine jointed conventional care in a high-risk patient. A 64-year-old male smoker with psoriatic arthritis and Crohns disease (39-year history, maintained on Golimumab) diagnosed with stage IV ccRCC (PET-CT confirmed 8th rib metastasis). Following radical nephrectomy, metastasectomy and palliative radioterapia, systemic terapia was deferred by the oncologic committee due to autoimmune flare risks (ASCO contraindication criterio). Life expectancy: 6-12 months. The patient sought integrative care, expressing existential distress: \"I want to live betternot only physically, but emotionally and mentally.\" Comprehensive evaluation revealed: - Chronic stress and melancholic temperament - Emotionally repressive childhood with financial instability - Unprocessed trauma from business failure and divorce - Profound sense of \"unlived life\" exacerbated by diagnosis. September 2023 diagnosis of ccRCC stage IV. Initial care: Radical nephrectomy + metastasectomy + palliative radioterapia. Maintenance care: Continued Golimumab. January 2024 starts protocol of complementary medicine. Biopsy and PET-CT confirmed 8th rib metastasis; inflammatory markers normal. A complementary protocol based on the Healing Path method addressed physical, emotional, behavioral, and spiritual dimensions in agreement to psychoneuroimmunology evidence supporting the impact of stress and emotional burden on cancer progression (Green McDonald et al. 2013) (Chen X et al 2022). The program included: - Flower remedy Arliberum (15 drops every 12 hours) - Custom floral formula (10 drops every 6 hours) - Mind-Body Therapy sessions every 2-weeks - Nutritional counseling anti-inflammatory diet and lifestyle support The intervenção aimed at liberating emotional conflict through structured routines, therapeutic goals, and patient empowerment. By April 2025 (16 month-follow-up) PET-CT showed no evidence of active oncologic lesions. The patient continued biological terapia with stable autoimmune disease, inflammatory markers continued normal, and described: - Increased motivation to quit smoking - Improved emotional expression and self-worth - Renewed capacity for solitude and introspection - Strengthened relationships with family No efeitos adversos were reported, adherence to integrative terapia remains high. This case presents three key observations: - Clinical stability was maintained despite ICI contraindication. - Psychoneuroimmunological mechanisms may explain resultados, as chronic stress reduction can modulate immune function. - Existential distress resolution appeared to significantly impact qualidade de vida. This case illustrates the potential role of integrative oncology in patients with advanced ccRCC who cannot receive ICIs. Complementary approaches may promote not only qualidade de vida but also clinical stabilization. Limitations Short-term follow-up, natural history variability and absence of controlled data limit generalizability.",

    "abstract": "Integrative Medicine has stood out in global health by offering approaches that complement or, in some cases, replace conventional tratamentos, especially in oncology, where therapeutic options can cause side effects that compromise the patients qualidade de vida. BioFAO Medicine (Biofield Self-Organization Factors) works through the Archeus medication, promoting systemic self-organization and stimulating the bodys innate healing potential This report aims to describe the clinical course of an elderly patient with metastatic breast cancer who, exercising her decision-making autonomy, chose to use the Archeus medication exclusively as terapia. Additionally, it reflects on the ethical implications of this choice, focusing on the adherence to the bioethical principles of justice, beneficence, and non-maleficence, which are fundamental to patient-centered care and the preservation of qualidade de vida. 84-year-old widowed patient, accompanied by her two daughters, with a tumor in the right breast, pain, swelling in the arm, fatigue, and depressão. Physical exam: nodule in the right breast with local hyperemia and edema in the right upper limb (2+/4+). Chest and abdominal CT showed metastatic lesions in the lung, liver, and spine; elevated tumor markers CEA and CA 15.3. Family declined chemoterapia due to fear of side effects because of her age. No previous comorbidities. First appointment on 19/10/2024 in Vale do Matutu, MG. After clinical evaluation and tests, Archeus was prescribed. Online follow-up and tests every two or three months, with a new Archeus cycle after each evaluation, in parallel with the oncologist. 03/09/2024  Chest CT: Expansive lesion in the right breast measuring 5.7 x 3.5 cm, multiple pulmonary nodules, the largest measuring approximately 1.8 x 1.4 cm. 03/09/2024  Abdominal CT: liver lesion (3.7 x 3.7 cm) and lytic lesion in L4. 09/10/2024  Tumor markers: CEA 46.61 ng/ml; CA 15.3: 243.3 u/ml. 19/10/2024  First appointment (Vale do Matutu); Archeus prescribed after clinical evaluation. Prognosis  Metastatic breast cancer (stage IV); incurable, but manageable. Intervention with 1 cycle of Archeus (17 doses), a homeopathic compound approved by ANVISA since 2017, composed of Antimonium crudum, Kali carbonicum, Mercurius solubilis, Sulphur, Natrum muriaticum, Aurum metallicum, and Ammonium muriaticum. It acts on energy centers related to the endocrine system, stimulating immunity and innate healing. Average duration: 2 months. Improved mood, fatigue, pain, and swelling; resumed cooking. Markers (06/11/25): CA 15.3 : 218,70 u/ml Markers (18/02/25) : CA 15.3 : 56,1 u/ml Markers (09/05/25): CEA 5.8 ng/ml; CA 15.3: 35.6 u/ml. CT (09/05/25): calcified lung nodules; no liver lesions. No side effects. BioFAO Medicine proposes that bioregulation of the biofield, through homeopathic medicines, stimulates the immune system's innate healing capacity, even in serious conditions such as cancer. (Amorim, 2018) Although there are basic studies in animals and other chronic conditions, rigorous clinical research is still lacking to validate its oncological use. The exclusive use of Archeus raises ethical issues related to non-maleficence, beneficence, justice, and the need for transparent informed consent regarding its unproven efetividade.",

Neuroscience and neuroimaging techniques describe the perceptual phenomenon, mapping its processes in the human body regarding evolutionary neurological marks learning and memory. In this context, we present a relato de caso of a child with limbic encephalitis secondary to group B streptococcus infection with refractory mesial temporal lobe epilepsy, who was treated with neurosurgery intervenção and anthroposophic therapies. A six-year-old female who presented fever and cough, receiving antibiotic terapia (amoxicillin-sulbactam). A week later, she manifested drowsiness and loss of consciousness, having a febrile convulsion, culminating in a status epilepticus that led her to remain four months in an intensive care unit, with assisted ventilation and monitoring. After discharge, she had multiple daily seizures (around fifty per day), refractory to the association of the antiepileptic drugs (AED). The seizures and the side-effects of the drugs did not allow her to have a normal life, needing a constantly nursing care. Previously to the anthroposophic approach, the exam of the CSF detected an increased number of lymphocytes, and proteins, which is seen in encephalitis. The FDG-PET/CT image after the surgery revealed right temporal hypometabolism due to surgery resection, and CT showed moderated frontal and parietal edema possibly related to pos-surgical edema. Post-surgically, the MRI showed reactional gliosis in the right temporal region, with mesial unilateral sclerosis. The EEG findings highlighted the high intensity spikes and electrical brain rhythm disorganization. Five years later, she started the following multimodal anthroposophic therapies: Pressel massage, craniosacral terapia, anthroposophic external therapies, biographic work with pedagogical medicine, medical care focused on neuro anthroposophic approach in all sessions, and the following .edicines (injectable/oral):helloborus D6 (oral and injectable), and the injectables: cuprum aceticum D4, zincum valeriana D6, bryophyllum argentum cultum D5 calycinum D5, calcarean carbonica D6, rhus D4 + hypericum D5 + bryonia D5, chelidonium D5 + cardum D5 and viscum P (Iscador). This pattern was changed after eight months of tratamento with the anthroposophic therapies. Two years after the beginning of the anthroposophic approach, the seizures frequency decreased expressively (mean = 5 seizures/day), being the patient free of seizures for until 60 days. The tratamento made possible her return to school and reestablishment of her other life activities. The multimodal therapies with the medicines applied contributed to harmonize the role of brain measurement of the organ superficial tension, simultaneously reducing this tension (acting directly controlling the seizures) and strengthening the regenerative processes and circadian rhythms (reducing the nocturnal seizures). The protection and shield of the vitality and strengthening of the immunological defense minimized the symptoms of encephalitis, gliosis, and hippocampal sclerosis.",

It represents an advance in expanding oncological care beyond conventional biomedical practices, enhancing qualidade de vida and preventing tumor recurrence Female, 51 years old, cardiopulmonary physical therapist and university professor, pescetarian and spiritualist. Lives in São Paulo, married, mother of two daughters. Leads a sedentary urban lifestyle, consumes processed foods, and has little contact with nature. Medical history includes thrombophlebitis, osteopenia, constipation, ansiedade, and cesarean deliveries. Symptoms: left leg pain, progressive abdominal discomfort, menopausal symptoms, joint stiffness, low body self-esteem. Non-smoker, no alcohol use. Family history of diabetes. Mother had gestational toxoplasmosis. Shows signs of self-compassion syndrome, limiting beliefs, deep emotional suffering. Hospitalized in September 2023. Underwent extensive oncological surgery (hysterectomy, peritoneal cytoreduction, lymphadenectomy, rectosigmoidectomy); received chemoterapia until February 2024, with probable remission of the disease. Clinical findings were shoulder and thumb pain and stiffness, thoracic kyphosis, internal shoulder rotation, fascial and scar changes, dyslipidemia, hepatic steatosis, obesity (BMI 28), chronic fatigue and insomnia. Began transdisciplinar care in February 2025, showing significant improvement. Sep 2023: symptom onset. Oct 2023: discharged post-surgery. Nov 2023Feb 2024: chemoterapia. Feb 2025: transdisciplinary evaluation. FebApr 2025: integrative practices. Apr 2025: clinical, laboratory, emotional, and physical improvement. Findings revealed thrombophlebitis, pelvic mass, possible carcinomatosis, enlarged lymph nodes, and hepatic steatosis. The transdisciplinar team encounter the patient to apply a supradisciplinar diagnosis method (develop by Bignardi and col. 2005), reaching the following aspects through the phenomenological appreciation: anxious patterns, restlessness, stagnation, and existential disconnection. Supradisciplinary diagnosis considered five dimensions of the person appreciated: Physical, Metabolic, Vital, Mental and Supramental. Transdisciplinar intervençãos were planned considering downwards causative law (proposed by Quantum Mechanics) were Yoga (pranayama), craniosacral terapia, alchemical flower remedies, homeopatia, behavioral nutrition, low-glycemic and antioxidant diet, vitamin D, turmeric, magnesium supplementation, manual osteopathy, foot baths, aromaterapia and sunlight exposure. Magnetic resonance imaging showed no tumor, improved liver health, and inflammation resolution. WHOQOL-BREF indicated improvement in all domains. Cholesterol, BMI, and fat mass decreased. Patient reported better sleep, good bowel function, increased energy levels, and reduced pain. Colchicine and pregabalin were reintroduced after discontinuation of bodywork therapies. Conventional biomolecular approach shows limitations in reaching human complexity. This phenomenological appreciation allows an expanded over view of the person in her whole integrity, where therapeutic bonding plays a key hole in supporting an essential transformation process, which results could be verified through clinical, laboratory and subjective improvements. Desafios included maintaining continuous adherence and lack of complementary exams (e.g., cortisol). The results obtained are anchored in neuroscience studies related to the neuropsychoimmunoendocrine axis.",

    "abstract": "Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) Dietary Therapy (DT) and Herbal Therapy (HT) have supported cancer care in Asia for centuries, often alongside chemoterapia and immunoterapia. While Western medicine targets disease eradication, TCM emphasizes restoring balance and resilience. Increasingly, TCM DT and HT are integrated into Western acadêmico medical centers to manage side effects and improve recovery. This case illustrates their application in a Western medical system, highlighting potential quality-of-life benefits in advanced cancer. An 84-year-old woman with stage IV bladder and right kidney cancer was referred to integrative care after discontinuing pembrolizumab due to severe side effects. Presenting symptoms included fatigue, weight loss, foot ulcers, and poor sleep. Her daughter, the atenção primáriagiver, sought dietary guidance after transitioning her mother from a ketogenic to a plant-based diet. The patient expressed a desire to return to warm, traditional Chinese foods. Treatment began in early November. Herbal foods were introduced gradually over two weeks. The patient also joined integrative group visits focused on diet and movement. Assessments occurred at baseline, one month, and three months. TCM pattern differentiation revealed Qi and Yin deficiency with Spleen and Lung Qi weakness. Outcomes were based on clinical observation and patient/family reports; validated quality-of-life instruments were not used due to hospice status. Sheng Mai San herbs was selected to tonify Qi, nourish Yin, and support heart-lung function.Yu Ping Feng San herbs aimed to strengthen Wei Qi and reduce infection risk.Dietary recommendations included warm, cooked, anti-inflammatory meals such as congee, millet, legumes, and soups with organic chicken and herbs like Ren Shen (ginseng), Huang Qi (astragalus), and Ling Zhi (Ganoderma). Adherence was high, supported by the daughters active involvement. No efeitos adversos were reported. By one month, the patients weight increased from 99 to 106 lbs. Foot ulcers healed, and she reported improved energy, sleep, and mobilityprogressing from wheelchair-bound to walking with a walker. Glucose and blood pressure remained stable without medication. Despite a minor cervical fracture from a fall in December, she continued to improve with conservative management. This case demonstrates that culturally sensitive TCM DT and HT can enhance qualidade de vida in advanced cancer. TCM principles were adapted to align with Western healthcare protocols, emphasizing segurança and collaboration. Family education included dietary counseling and explanation of herbal formulas. Personalized nutrition and herbal support, combined with caregiver involvement, contributed to improved strength, symptom control, and emotional well-being. Limitations include the single-case design, lack of control comparison, and reliance on subjective resultado measures. Objective tumor response data were unavailable due to hospice status.",

    "abstract": "Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) Herbal Therapy (HT) has long been used in Asia to support patients undergoing cancer tratamento, focusing on restoring balance, nourishing the body, and improving qualidade de vida. In Western settings, TCM is increasingly integrated into oncology care to address side effects, enhance survivorship, and support patient well-being. This case illustrates the use of the TCM formula Suan Zao Ren Tang (SZRT) to manage sleep disturbances in a patient with recurrent metastatic breast cancer undergoing endocrine terapia. The patient is a 65-year-old Ashkenazi Jewish woman with a history of iron deficiency anemia, hypothyroidism, small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), and chronic insomnia. She was initially diagnosed with ER+/PR+ right breast invasive ductal carcinoma in 2014 and underwent lumpectomy, chemoterapia, radiation, and multiple endocrine therapies (anastrazole, letrozole, exemestane, tamoxifen). In 2024, she was diagnosed with recurrent metastatic disease and treated with surgical biopsy, chemoterapia, right axillary node dissection, and radiation. She was started on letrozole, abemaciclib (Verzenio), and zoledronic acid (Zometa). The patient was referred to integrative medicine due to persistent insomnia, worsened by endocrine terapia. She expressed interest in Suan Zao Ren Tang, a traditional formula known for its calming and sleep-promoting properties. The formula includes Suan Zao Ren (Ziziphus), Fu Ling (Poria), Chuan Xiong, Zhi Mu, and Gan Cao. After reviewing the literature and confirming no contraindications (e.g., anticoagulant use), she was started on a 7:1 water extract of SZRT (500 mg/tablet), taken twice daily. In addition to herbal terapia, a comprehensive sleep support plan was implemented, including stress management techniques (yoga nidra, meditação), circadian rhythm regulation, cooling strategies for night sweats, acupuntura, and digital tools such as CBT-I and sleep apps. Magnesium glycinate was also recommended to support sleep and counteract potential gastrointestinal side effects from Verzenio. After implementing recommendations including SZRT use, the patient reported improved sleep quality, fewer nighttime awakenings, and feeling more rested. After a few months, her hot flashes had significantly decreased, and she was able to discontinue SZRT while maintaining restful sleep. Six months later, she remained on letrozole and abemaciclib with no recurrence of insomnia. Her most recent scans (March 2025) showed no evidence of disease (NED). This case demonstrates the potential of TCM herbal terapia, specifically SZRT, to address endocrine terapia-related insomnia in breast cancer patients. The integrative approachcombining baseado em evidence herbal support with lifestyle and mind-body intervençãoswas well tolerated and contributed to improved qualidade de vida and tratamento adherence. SZRT may be a safe and effective adjunct for managing sleep disturbances in patients undergoing endocrine terapia for breast cancer. When integrated into a comprehensive care plan, TCM herbal therapies can support symptom relief and enhance survivorship resultados.",

    "abstract": "This case study focused on the tratamento of fibromyalgia (FM) in a 59-year-old female patient who had experienced symptoms and suffering since 2014. The patient underwent five sessions in September 2023 at targeted acupuntura points. The results demonstrated a significant improvement, with a 70% reduction in pain after the first session and an overall improvement of 90% by the conclusion of the tratamento. A follow-up in April 2025 indicated that FM had not recurred, suggesting the tratamento's lasting effects. This study supports acupuntura as an effective complementary terapia for FM and related conditions, in alignment with the principles of Traditional Chinese Medicine, but it also emphasizes the need for further empirical research to validate these findings. Generalized muscle pain, particularly in the extremities, is often described by patients as a sensation of pain in the bones, especially in the hands. Codeine is used for pain relief. Additionally, there is hypersensitivity to touch, particularly when being hugged. Poor sleep quality, along with the use of Zolpidem, consequently leads to fatigue, a loss of focus, and decreased productivity. Between 2006 and 2020, she underwent two surgeries to correct a deviated septum and to treat sinusitis. Briquism is characterized by a locked jaw and orofacial pain. Initially, a trigeminal nerve infection was suspected, and tratamento was administered; however, there was unfortunately no response. The patient experienced migraines on the right side, but imaging tests revealed no abnormalities. Triggering factors included light and noise sensitivity. In 2019, polysomnography was conducted, but no symptoms were detected. The patient's mood was affected by depressão, memory loss, and constipation lasting two to three days, accompanied by cramps. The patient received five acupuntura sessions between September 16 and 28, 2023. A rheumatologist diagnosed the patient with fibromyalgia in 2014, and polysomnography conducted in 2019 revealed no abnormalities. According to TCM pulse diagnosis, the patient exhibits a moderately weak to severe pulse in the chi position, indicating kidney deficiency. This condition is characterized as a cold syndrome, manifested by non-localized pain, and the patient reports feeling cold. Acupuncture tratamento with the objectives of addressing temporomandibular joint dysfunction (TMJ), sleep disturbances, sinusitis, and cold deficiency syndrome. Methods: Acupuncture, moxibustion, warm needle acupuntura, and electroacupuntura. Acupoints Utilized: LI20(Yingxiang), EXTRA 7/M-HN-14(Bitong), EX-HN3(Yintang), GV20(Baihui), EX-HN1(Sishencong), SI19(Tinggong), SI19(Tinggong), ST6(Jiache), GB20(Fengchi), CV4(Guanyuan), CV6(Qihai), LR3(Taichong), ST36(Zusanli), GB34(Yanglingquan), EX-LE15(Linghou), SP6(Sanyinjiao), PC6(Neiguan), CV17(Danzhong); Mestre Tung Acupoints: T77.17(Tianhuang), T77.19(Dihuang), T77.21(Renhunag). A follow-up in April 2025 indicated that FM had not recurred, suggesting the tratamento's lasting effects. In this case, the cause of TMD was not immediately identified. Additionally, sleep disturbances resulting from rhinopathy and restless leg syndrome contributed to the persistence of pain over many years. The study supports acupuntura as an effective complementary terapia for FM and related conditions, consistent with Traditional Chinese Medicine principles, but calls for further empirical research to confirm these findings.",

    "abstract": "Metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) has a 5-year survival rate of just 13% for Stage IV disease [American Cancer Society 2025]. In Chile, access to second-line terapia is limited due to public healthcare constraints [Mondschein et al 2022]; therefore, being in palliative cancer care is considered a death-row. This creates a critical need for complementary approaches address patients wellbeing and existential aspects. We report an exceptional case of long-term survival in mCRC using homeopathic and psychosocial intervençãos under the Healing Path Method, challenging palliative expectations. A 74-year-old female presented with: 2011: Stage III rectal adenocarcinoma (pT3N1M0), treated with surgery, FOLFOX, and radioterapia. 2013: Lung metastases (Stage IV), managed with metastasectomy. 2014: New unresectable lung nodule. Due to chemoterapia-induced toxicity (Grade 3) and lack of caregiver support, she declined further systemic terapia and opted for integrative care in March 2014. Perspectiva do Paciente and Psychosocial Evaluation Patient was referred to Unit for Integrative Medicine in public hospital, expressing existential distress: \"I want to die well. The psychiatric team says I am depressed, but I am not; I am just realistic.\" Key psychosocial findings included: - Strong familial cancer history (four first-degree relatives) - Childhood marked by feeling rejected by father and physical punishment. - Unresolved grief from partner abandonment. - Profound sense of being rejected combined with resentment. - Ostomy-related shame and social isolation. 2014 start of integrative care. 2020 interruption of integrative care due to Covid-Pandemic. Maintenance: Palliative tratamento. 2013 Colorectal cancer stage IV diagnosed with CT and biopsy. The Healing Path Method addressed physical, emotional, behavioral, and spiritual dimensions liberating inner conflict in a phase-based integrative program: 1. Physical: Custom homeopathic formulation (15 drops/8h) 2. Emotional & Behavioral: Narrative reconstruction and self-acceptance 3. Spiritual & Environmental: Biweekly-to-monthly mind-body terapia for reconciliation, nature and conscious sunlight immersion Clinical: - Radiologic stability: Lung nodule unchanged since 2016. - Biochemical: Normalized CEA levels (2016present). - Functional: ECOG performance status improved to 1 (2017). Psychosocial - Emotional healing through reconciliation achieving inner peace. - Strengthened relationship with son. - Renewed sense of connection with nature and life purpose. No efeitos adversos were reported. This case highlights three key observations: 1. Prolonged Survival: The patient exceeded expected survival by nearly a decade, despite metastatic progression. 2. Psychoneuroimmunological Mechanisms: Perceived stress reduction may have modulated inflammation and immune function, potentially influencing disease control [Chen et al 2022]. 3. Existential Healing: Therapeutically addressing \"dying well\" shifted her focus to living well, improving QoL. Conclusion This report challenges the inevitability of rapid decline in mCRC, suggesting that integrative care particularly psychosocial and existential support liberating the inner conflict may enhance survival and well-being. Rigorous ensaio clínicos are needed to validate these findings. Limitations - Single-case design prevents generalization. - Possible indolent tumor biology cannot be excluded. - Lack of standardized QoL metrics.",

    "abstract": "More than half of the population in Western industrialized countries is temporarily affected by a sleep disorder, and around 10% suffer from a chronic condition. Symptoms include difficulty falling asleep, sleeping through the night, or early morning awakenings, associated with impaired daytime performance that must persist for more than four to twelve weeks. First-line tratamento is cognitive behavioural terapia (CBT), with short-term use of sedatives, hypnotics, or antidepressants if CBT is insufficient. However, sedatives carry a dependency risk, and there are no clear guidelines for complementary medicine due to insufficient data. According to the hyperarousal model, inadequate downregulation of the stress system can lead to persistent overexcitation. This case series explores the use of an Anthroposophic Medicine (AM) remedy, Bryophyllum Argento cultum, for chronic insomnia with coexisting factors for hyperarousal. Three patients with chronic insomnia and one or more factors for hyperarousal were included.  Case 1: 11-year history of chronic insomnia and a history of trauma; 10mg zolpidem sporadically.  Case 2: lifelong insomnia linked to childhood war experiences; 10 mg zolpidem regularly  Case 3: PTSD, high sensitivity and new-onset insomnia with daytime restlessness; lorazepam on demand. All three patients were treated over several months and followed up up to 4 years. The diagnosis was chronic insomnia, characterized by difficulty falling asleep and sleeping through the night or early morning awakenings, leading to impaired daytime performance. Patients also presented with one or more additional factors for hyperarousal. All three patients received Bryophyllum Argento cultum 2x or 3x, administered at a dose of 15 drops, one to three times daily.  Case 1: Received Bryophyllum Argento cultum 3x.  Case 2: Started Bryophyllum Argento cultum 3x, which allowed for the tapering of zolpidem.  Case 3: Initiated Bryophyllum Argento cultum 2x and continued it as on-demand support (510 drops, 13 times/day). The remedy does not have any dependency or interaction potential with other medications. In all cases, a significant improvement in night sleep was observed within a few days of starting tratamento, including fewer nocturnal awakenings, an easier return to sleep, and enhanced daytime well-being.  Case 1: Showed marked and sustained improvement, discontinuing tratamento after ten months with the effect lasting over four years.  Case 2: Discontinued daily zolpidem within four months, only requiring it as an occasional low-dose medication during the one-year follow-up.  Case 3: Symptoms and the need for lorazepam resolved within one week of starting tratamento. The terapia was continued as on-demand support over a three-year follow-up. In Anthroposophic Medicine, Bryophyllum Argento cultum 2x and 3x has been used for decades to improve the autonomic nervous system's ability to relax, for example, after shock-like experiences. This case series suggests it may offer a safe and effective long-term therapeutic option for chronic insomnia in patients with hyperarousal-related vulnerability. Controlled ensaio clínicos are warranted to further substantiate its efficacy for this indication.",

    "abstract": "Congenital meningomyelocele is a severe spinal malformation caused by incomplete neural tube closure during gestation, resulting in exposure of the spinal cord, nerve roots, and meninges to the amniotic fluid. Clinical consequences include lower limb paralysis, orthopedic deformities, urinary and fecal incontinence, and complications such as hydrocephalus and Arnold-Chiari malformation. The estimated incidence in Brazil is 1.4 to 2.4 cases per 10,000 births. Although early approaches described by Guttmann emphasized non-surgical management and physical activity, current standard care involves surgical intervenção; however, many patients still face functional impairments, underscoring the need for integrative and personalized long-term. This case involves a 49-year-old male public servant and wheelchair user with a history of meningomyelocele, surgically treated at 11 months. At age 7, he underwent colostomy due to persistent fecal pressure ulcers. Additional structural issues include scoliosis, spondylosis, lumbar osteophytosis, paralysis and deformities of the lower limbs, tendinitis, bursitis, migraine, tinnitus, hearing loss, and asymptomatic hepatitis C. Emotional disturbances, largely influenced by social factors, are also present. Since 2018, he has been under naturopathic care, initially presenting with widespread chronic musculoskeletal pain, frequent migraine with visual disturbances, limited mobility, and emotional challenges. Over time, he experienced progressive improvement in body awareness, reduced migraine frequency, and increased emotional expression. Notably, in 2020, the patient reported new sensations such as numbness and tingling in previously insensate areas including the gluteal region, groin, and coccyx, suggesting possible late neuroplastic changes. Throughout the years, he has faced barriers related to accessibility, ergonomics at home, and physical overload, along with emotional fluctuations. Despite these challenges, the patient achieved meaningful functional milestones, such as moving to independent living, participating in a Paralympic running event, and rediscovering personal autonomy. Recently, he described new sensory perceptions in the upper thighs, areas previously without sensation. He continues regular follow-ups every 1 to 3 months, focusing on pain control, emotional stability, and qualidade de vida enhancement. The naturopathic tratamento includes anatomical restructuring, phytoterapia, aromaterapia, flower essence terapia, iridology, ergonomic guidance, and self-care education. Anatomical restructuring has demonstrated efetividade in reducing osteomyoarticular pain and improving proprioception, also contributing to the prevenção of late complications, as supported by spinal cord rehabilitation literature. Theoretically, this case resonates with foundational neurological rehabilitation principles, as established by Guttmann, Hardy, and Frankel, which emphasize the potential for late sensory recovery and neuroplasticity even in congenital spinal lesions. Overall, this case illustrates the potential of integrating naturopathic approaches with anatomical restructuring technique in managing chronic, complex neurological conditions. It highlights the importance of addressing physical, emotional, and psychosocial dimensions, centering care on the individuals autonomy and qualidade de vida.",

    "abstract": "Breast cancer remains the most prevalent malignancy among women worldwide, with endocrine terapia (ET) playing a crucial role in reducing recurrence and mortality rates for hormone receptor-positive cases. Despite its proven efficacy, ET is frequently associated with efeitos adversos, particularly musculoskeletal symptoms (MSS), such as arthralgia and myalgia, which can significantly impair qualidade de vida and lead to reduced adherence or premature discontinuation of terapia. The efetividade of available pharmacological and non-pharmacological intervençãos is often limited. Anthroposophic Medicine (AM) has been proposed as a potential integrative strategy to support patient well-being during cancer tratamento. Three pre- or postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer were included. All were undergoing ET and experiencing significant MS that was refractory to conventional management respective physical activity. Clinical data were collected over a minimum follow-up period of three years through regular patient consultations. The severity of musculoskeletal pain was evaluated using patient-reported resultado measures (PROMs) and the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). This case series investigated the therapeutic potential of the anthroposophic medicine remedy Arnica/Levisticum 6x comp for ET-induced MSS. To assess the reproducibility and durability of the therapeutic effect, tratamento interruption and resuming trials were conducted for each patient. All three patients reported marked and rapid improvement of their symptoms after starting Arnica/Levisticum 6x comp. Symptom relief was typically achieved within 23 weeks, with a mean reduction of 24 points on the VAS. During periods of medication interruption, symptoms recurred, and they consistently resolved upon resuming the medication. The medication was well tolerated over the entire observation period of at least three years, with no efeitos adversos reported. This case series provides preliminary evidence supporting the efficacy and segurança of Arnica/Levisticum 6x comp as a complementary tratamento for ET-induced MSS in breast cancer patients. The consistent symptom relief, excellent tolerability, and long-term segurança suggest this AM medication may be a valuable adjunct to conventional supportive care. By improving qualidade de vida and promoting adherence to ET, it could contribute to better long-term resultados. A larger controlled study would be needed to further confirm these findings.",

Female, 37 y/o, Key issues: HER2+ left breast cancer (Oct 2022) with axillary/supraclavicular lymph node metastases; Treatment non-adherence due to cardiotoxicity/GI intolerance (only 4 cycles completed); Progressive symptoms: Breast ulceration (4 months), chest/back pain, exertional dyspnea. 2022-10: Initial diagnosis without metastasis 2022-2024: Incomplete chemo/targeted terapia (4 cycles) 2024-10: Left breast ulceration onset 2025-03: Imaging confirmed multiorgan metastases (bone/lung/lymph nodes) and massive pleural effusion (CA153: 961.8 U/mL, cT4N3M1) 2025-04: Initiated integrated terapia Physical: Ulcerated left breast (3×3cm mass), bilateral supraclavicular LNs (2×2cm), diminished left lung sounds Imaging (CT, Mar 2025): Multiple metastatic lesions (lungs, bones, cervical/mediastinal LNs) Large pleural effusion Lab: Elevated CA153 (961.8 U/mL) TCM Pattern: Liver qi stagnation, spleen deficiency, lung qi dysfunction with phlegm-stasis binding Western Medicine Chemoimmunoterapia: Albumin-bound paclitaxel + Carboplatin + Trastuzumab + Pertuzumab (q21d ×2 cycles) Traditional Chinese Medicine Herbal Formula: Customized decoction (1 dose/day) to:Soothe liver & fortify spleen, Disperse lung qi & resolve exterior, Eliminate phlegm & dissipate stasis Non-pharmacological: Acupuncture: Scalp, costosternal joints, peri-tumor breast encircling Fire needle: Shallow stimulation at Huatuo Jiaji points Bloodletting + Cupping: Ganshu (BL18), Weishu (BL21) Manual release: T4-level spinal nodules Moxibustion: Dazhui (GV14), Fengmen (BL12), Feishu (BL13), Zhongwan (CV12), Qihai (CV6), Guanyuan (CV4) Symptom Improvement:Chest/back pain (NRS 41-2); Exertional dyspnea resolved; Breast ulceration dried with scab formation Objective Metrics:CA153 73% (961.8260.2 U/mL) CT: Near-complete pleural fluid resolution; significant reduction in lung metastases Functional Status: KPS from 7090 This advanced breast cancer patient (with multi-metastases and massive pleural effusion) had low confidence in Western medicine. Key challenges were: 1) Enhancing acceptance of integrated Chinese-Western terapia; 2) Choosing a malignant effusion strategy (drainage risks vs. conservative management). Studies indicate that combining Chinese herbs with Western tratamento may reduce mortality risk, while acupuntura improves pain and qualidade de vida. In this case, pleural effusion was managed without drainage. After 2 cycles of albumin-bound paclitaxel/carboplatin/dual HER2 blockade plus integrated Chinese medicine (fire needle for warming-dredging, moxibustion for water regulation, peri-tumor needling for collateral-dredging, bloodletting cupping), the effusion was nearly absorbed with complete resolution of dyspnea. TCM contributed three key values: Symptom relief & improved QoL, Enhanced tratamento tolerance, Synergistic efficacy (73% CA153 reduction; 20-point KPS improvement) Long-term resultados and standardization of TCM external therapies require further study.",

The purpose of this study is to evaluate how the inspection of the tongue can characterize a chronic process. INFORMATION PATIENTS: C. C., a 50-year-old female, Black, obesity degree 3, body mass index: 46.02 kg/m2, no children, high school educated, and subjected to hysterectomy at the age of 41, was diagnosed at the age of 50 as having metaplastic mesenchymal breast cancer T2, N0, M0, stage IIA. TIMELINE: The patient took part in the study and underwent acupressure sessions once a week, and Paclitaxel was administered weekly. From the beginning, the tongue showed specific characteristics. DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION: The tongue assessment instrument was standardized as follows: the examination of the assessment of the can be normal, chronic impairment, and irreversible chronic impairment. THERAPEUTIC INTERVENTION: In February 2019, the patient was to participate in an Oncomastology study in São Paulo Hospital - UNIFESP in which the research protocol was followed during the paclitaxel cycles, and selection to tratamento in the group \"Stiper - chemical composition was nothing but SiO2 (acupressure technique). FOLLOW-UP AND OUTCOMES: In the current study, purple spots were found in the following regions: left/right liver, lung/heart. The characteristics of the tongue show predominantly a purple color, moved towards the left: colored spots, tooth marks, cracks/fissures, and also black spots on the tongue, mainly in the region of the heart. In 2019, the patient already presented characteristics of the sickening process and progression of the illness. A purple-colored tongue (stasis) reveals a great deal in the prognosis of the patient, and it can evolve in a sudden and aggressive way, thus being a risk to the patients life. DISCUSSION: The importance of this report is to inform that the evaluation of the tongue can help to discover the progression of the illness.",

    "abstract": "The patient was selected because her white blood count rose after the acupuntura session, making the use of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) medication unnecessary. The aim of this report was to show non-drug management to improve myelosuppression. M.N.R.A., 42 years old, diagnosed with CINE + mucinous, RE+, RP+, HER+, (FISH+), KI67 < 14% in left breast, staging T2N1M1 (liver). The patient denied any addictions, allergies, or previous surgeries. Obstetric history: 3 pregnancies and 3 births (2C1N), breastfed for 5 years, menarche at 16, and contraceptive method practiced: condom. Family history: aunt and paternal cousin had breast cancer at 45 and 55, respectively. Medication for labyrinthitis. The patient was diagnosed with breast cancer. During chemoterapia, she had leukopenia, and after the acupuntura session, her leukocyte and neutrophil levels increased, making the application of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) unnecessary. The initial approach was neoadjuvant chemoterapia: 4AC+12TH, but with the detection of a liver lesion, Trastuzumab associated with Taxol was prescribed. The patient began acupuntura tratamento before the first infusion of anthracycline chemoterapia to avoid leukopenia and neutropenia, and the points were used: GV14, CV6, ST36, SP6, KI3, GB39 in all sessions. A total of 9 acupuntura sessions. The patient had a control leukogram before the cycles, which took place every 21 days. The leukograms prior to the 2nd and 3rd cycles of acupuntura showed leukopenia and neutropenia. After the acupuntura sessions, the leukocyte and neutrophil counts improved, and the administration of G-CSF for secondary prophylaxis was not necessary. G-CSF is prescribed in this SUS service when the leukocyte levels< 3500/mm³ and/or neutrophils <1000/uL. G-CSF prophylaxis is effective in increasing the count of neutrophils and prevent febrile neutropenia in patients undergoing myelosuppressive chemoterapia, but its indication poses risks. Acupuncture may be relevant as an ally in cancer tratamento in patients who have associated morbidities that prevent them from using certain medications, such as allergic and transplant patients, as well as being studied for secondary prophylaxis of myelosuppression.",

    "abstract": "Although the Joel Aleixo System flower essences have been used for approximately 30 years, there is no scientific literature documenting relato de casos, clinical experiences, or studies involving patients with panic syndrome and ansiedade treated with this type of flower terapia. This flower essence system, recognized by Brazil's Unified Health System, is distinguished by the way in which the components of 99 Brazilian flowers are extracted, enriching the flower essences with trace elements, capable of acting on the mental and emotional realms, transforming sensations and feelings, as we will see in this case study. The patient, a 24-year-old Brazilian female, obese, and a veterinary physician, began experiencing palpitations, ansiedade, and a sensation and fear of imminent death. She was diagnosed by a psychiatrist with panic disorder, which began during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2021, and started interfering with her professional activities. She had been taking Escitalopram 10 mg for six months and sublingual Clonazepam during crises, which occurred two to three times per week. In the alchemical therapeutic anamnesis, numerous difficulties were identified in relation to her mother during the gestational period, and later throughout childhood and adolescence, when she was primarily raised and cared for by her paternal grandparents and her mother. Insecure and without prospects, she worked in a position below her qualification, doing exhausting night shifts, subject to the available work in the city. In 2021, she began tratamento for ansiedade and panic disorder with a psychiatrist for six months, complementing it with flower remedies from the Joel Aleixo system, in two 50-day phases. In the first phase, she noticed improvement in symptoms, with a reduction in attacks, and began taking sublingual clonazepam once every two weeks. In the second phase, her doctor reduced and then discontinued the medication. The diagnosis was generalized ansiedade and panic attacks. The selection of flower essences in the Joel Aleixo system is more complex than in other floral systems. There are protocol formulas for cleansing feminine energy, which represent the first phase, lasting 50 days and using essences of anthurium, bromeliad, tibouchina, geranium, lantana, pansy, plumbago, and marigold. The second phase, also lasting 50 days, uses essences of aloe vera, geranium, sunflower, azalea, bracatinga, mandacaru, amaryllis, geranium, and hibiscus. There were no side effects from the flower essences; the patient used the formulas correctly. There was a progressive and significant reduction in symptoms, to the point that after 100 days, the doctor discontinued the anxiolytic. The patient decided to use another formula, which we call a matrix, which harmonizes feminine energy. Although the Joel Aleixo system's floral remedies are recognized by the SUS as complementary terapia, there are no bibliographic reports, to date, that bring statistical relevance, but this does not mean that they do not exist, it only demonstrates the need for studies with a scientific approach to data collection.",

EMSB, 67 year old, female, single, childless, brazilian, retired psychologist. Chronic smoker and social drinker. Patient with a very balanced psychosocial and medical history. January 2014: The patient reported jaw and maxillary (dental) pain and underwent diagnostic workup with a diagnosis of a right lung mass. April , 2014: she underwent a chest CT scan: a mass in the right upper lobe, with right hilar involvement and in continuity with the subcarineal mass, plus a mass centered over the mediastinum, involving vascular structures. May 2014: Mediastinoscopy: a poorly differentiated malignant neoplasm. Risk of superior vena cava compression syndrome (SCVCS). June 12, 2014, to August 13, 2014: she underwent radioterapia, chemioterapy and Viscum Album terapia. November 2022, Dyspnea and cough; CT showing active lesion. February 2023, biopsy performed, showing negative for malignant cells. Multislice CT of the chest Cranial CT PET oncology CT Performed every six months from 2014, until 2024, as a routine, demonstrating stability. Diagnosis: Small cell lung tumor (oat cell carcinoma), immunohistochemistry: high-grade neuroendocrine Guarded Prognosis Chemoterapia: Cisplatin and etoposide, 6 cycles every 21 days. Radioterapia: Dose administered: 60 Gy total dose/2 Gy daily. Additional: Viscum Album M (Helixor®) injectable and continues to this day. Initial with series I, II, and IV (starting at 1 mg until reaching 200 mg), and continued twice a week uninterrupted until today. The results of the intervenção exceeded the expectations of both the patient and her attending physicians, particularly given the guarded prognosis. The favorable adherence and tolerability can be attributed in part to the patient's personality, as well as to the complementary effects of Viscum Album. Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is the most aggressive form of neuroendocrine tumors and can rapidly metastasize. It is the subtype with the worst prognosis, with 5-year survival rates below 5% in advanced stages and 25-30% in limited stages. The patient in this report underwent conventional CT/RT, concomitantly with the complementary tratamento with Viscum Album and has maintained this to date, with an 11-year survival rate. During this time, the patient didnt show neither any signs of metastasis, nor reactivation of the original tumor. Conclusion: The facts in this specific clinical case indicate that early diagnosis of neuroendocrine tumors, especially when occurrences of metastases are not confirmed, and the institution of appropriate conventional tratamento combined with complementary tratamento with Viscum Album, can be decisive in increasing the survival rate and qualidade de vida of cancer patients.",

    "abstract": "Depression is a common and debilitating mental disorder characterized by persistent sadness, loss of interest in daily activities, and cognitive and physical impairments. It significantly affects an individual's qualidade de vida and productivity. Beyond its impact on personal health, depressão imposes a considerable social burden, including increased healthcare costs, reduced workforce participation, family dysfunction, and social isolation (Friedrich, 2017), being one of the leading causes of disability worldwide. Female patient, 30 years old, single, lawyer, Brazilian, presenting with complaints of depressão accompanied by anguish, panic, fear, ansiedade, syncopal episodes, and suicidal ideation. Her mother was controlling and manipulative. She had a boyfriend who was obsessive, controlling, manipulative, and dogmaticmirroring her mothers behavioral pattern. Despite his infidelities, her mother insisted she marry him. Feeling extremely suffocated, she broke off the engagement, fell into depressão, began losing weight, expressed a desire to die, and experienced intense guilt. Her hemorrhoidal bleeding worsened, even after several surgeries In October 2010, the patient presented with depressão, ansiedade, and panic attacks, treated with sertraline and clonazepam. She also had hemorrhoids and underwent multiple surgeries from 2008 to 2010, with ongoing bleeding. In February 2011, she was hospitalized in serious condition with anorexia, weakness, idiopathic hepatitis, and complications. Complementary tratamento with flower essences began in March 2011, and by July, her condition improved, leading to discontinuation of allopathic medication. She presents with depressão, ansiedade, and panic disorder, currently undergoing conventional medical tratamento, in addition to hemorrhoids, for which she has undergone two surgeries The selection of floral essences in the Joel Aleixo system is more complex than in other floral systems. There are protocol formulas for cleansing feminine energy, representing the first phase, which lasts 50 days and includes essences of anthurium, bromeliad, tibouchina, geranium, lantana, pansy, plumbago, and calendula. The second phase, also lasting 50 days, uses essences of aloe vera, geranium, sunflower, azalea, bracatinga, mandacaru, amaryllis, geranium, and hibiscus. Afterwards, the patient received a formula called Matrix, composed of extracts of araucaria, jacaranda, manacá, amaryllis, azalea, cactus, amaryllis, geranium, hibiscus, abutilon, water hyacinth, and dahlia, for an additional 50 days. An improvement in vitality and self-esteem was observed, along with a reduction in depressão, emotional stabilization, weight gain (13 kg), improved liver function with normalization of transaminase levels (ALT from 1,286 to 171 and AST from 538 to 89), cessation of hemorrhoidal bleeding, and increased performance at work and in acadêmico activities. The use of alchemical flower essences from the Joel Aleixo System appears to offer significant mental and physical health benefits, particularly in complex depressive conditions. Present in Brazil for over 30 years and recognized by the Unified Health System (SUS) since 2018 as an integrative practice, these essences still lack sufficient scientific validation. This case emphasizes the need for rigorous clinical research to support the efficacy of floral protocols and to strengthen their role in comprehensive mental healthcare.",

This case series documents the impact of an Ayurvedic polyherbal formulation, Panchkola churna, on cardiovascular risk reduction in individuals identified to be at risk for CVD in terms of gene expression study, signifying the preventive potential of Ayurveda. This case series evaluates four individuals (two males, two females, aged 3036 years) with sedentary occupational profiles identified as at risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Participants were asymptomatic but classified as at-risk based on abnormal lipid profiles, family history of CVD (myocardial infarction, stroke, or peripheral vascular occlusive disease), history of tobacco smoking, or documented hypertension. Three participants had no significant past medical or intervençãoal history. One male had mild hypertension, currently untreated. All reported a family history of CVD; no genetic diseases were noted. Physical examinations were unremarkable except for one participant with mild hypertension (elevated systolic blood pressure). No relevant prior intervençãos were reported. The participants were evaluated and administered the intervençãoal drug between 21st and 23rd August, 2024, with intermittent assessments on 5th and 7th September, 2024. Final assessments were made on 20th and 22nd September, 2024 All participants exhibited abnormal lipid profiles with low-risk FRS (<10% 10-year CVD risk), along with a score 10 in an Ayurveda-validated tool (RAS-RCVD) assessing Rasa Dhatu Dushti (impaired tissue metabolism linked to CVD risk), confirming Physical examination, lipid profiles, FRS (<10% 10-year CVD risk), and RAS-RCVD scale (10, indicating Rasa Dhatu Dushti) confirmed elevated CVD risk. Each participant received Panchakola Churna, a polyherbal Ayurvedic formulation, at a dosage of 2 g twice daily (BD), one hour before meals, with lukewarm water, for a duration of 30 days. Outcomes were assessed at 30±3 days, including lipid profile, APOE/IL-6 expression, FRS, RAS-RCVD scores. Compliance was monitored; no concurrent intervençãos and adverse events were reported. Post-intervenção, lipid profiles were improved: total cholesterol and triglycerides were lowered, HDL was raised, and LDL was reduced or stabilized. Total cholesterol/HDL and LDL/HDL ratios were enhanced. RAS-RCVD scores were lowered in most, and FRS was reduced in all. APOE and IL-6 expression was suppressed. Panchakola Churna, comprising Piper longum (Pippali, Pippalimoola), Piper retrofractum (Chavya), Plumbago zeylanica (Chitraka), and Zingiber officinale (Nagara), likely exerts cardiovascular benefits through bioactive compounds. Piperine from P. longum and P. retrofractum enhances lipid metabolism, reducing cholesterol and triglycerides while increasing HDL in animal models. Z. officinales gingerols exhibit anti-inflammatory effects, potentially suppressing IL-6 expression. P. zeylanicas plumbagin shows antioxidant properties, mitigating oxidative stress. These mechanisms, supported by Ayurvedic principles, suggest cardiovascular risk reduction, necessitating further clinical validation.",

    "abstract": "The Singular Therapeutic Project (STP) is a vital tool in Primary Health Care (PHC) for creating personalized, interdisciplinary care plans based on patients' real needs. Developed through collaborative dialogue between professionals and patients, the STP considers clinical, psychological, social, and cultural aspects. In complex dor crônica cases, such as knee osteoarthritis (KOA), the STP strengthens therapeutic relationships and enhances tratamento adherence. KOA first-line tratamento emphasizes non-pharmacological strategies like education, exercise, and weight management. Thus, integrative therapies represent cost-effective options to manage KOA and improve qualidade de vida. This relato de caso describes how implementing an STP helped manage dor crônica in a patient with KOA at an outpatient clinic offering complementary and integrative therapies (CIT). A 58-year-old man visited the clinic on January 8, 2025, reporting dor crônica from KOA. A night watchman, his job requires walking, which had become increasingly difficult due to bilateral knee and left foot pain. He rated his pain as 5/10 on the Visual Analog Scale and used NSAIDs periodically. He had become more sedentary but still handled basic errands. Mental health screening (PHQ-9, GAD-7) showed no signs of depressão or ansiedade. His wife, concerned about his reduced mobility, encouraged him to seek care. His medical history included obesity and hypertension; he was taking losartan, hydrochlorothiazide, and simvastatin. Previous physical terapia and auriculoterapia yielded limited results. Due to the case's complexity, a Singular Therapeutic Project was initiated with full patient engagement. His BMI was 49.3 (148 kg, 1.75 m), so orlistat was prescribed and dietary advice provided. A genogram, social network map, and ecomap identified limited physical activity and difficulty losing weight as vulnerabilities. Strengths included strong family support, motivation to reduce pain, and job flexibility. Goals were set to reduce pain, restore function, and regain autonomy. He committed to using a stationary bike at work and reducing caloric intake. 2022 - osteoarthritis diagnosis 2025, January - first medical assessment at Oswaldo Cruz Foundation healthcare center and STP elaboration 2025 March - the patient reported absence of pain. The diagnosis was made in 2022 based on knee X-rays taken with and without weight-bearing. The condition was classified as grade II according to the Kellgren & Lawrence scale. Integrative actions included: Aromaterapia: A blend of essential oils (copaíba, ginger, vetiver, clove, lavender) applied twice daily. Photobiomodulation: Weekly 808 nm laser terapia at knee and heel points, plus ILIB. Phytoterapia: Curcuma longa, 500 mg twice daily. Auriculoterapia: Weekly sessions using mustard seeds on acupuntura points related to pain and ansiedade. A photobiomodulation therapist served as the reference professional for continuity of care. After eight weeks, the patient reported near-total pain relief, resumed full work duties, lost 8 kg, and regularly exercised. His mood and engagement at home improved, as noted by his wife. The STP effectively integrated clinical and holistic approaches, centering care around the patient's goals and context. This person-centered, interdisciplinary model aligned with PHC principles, improving resultados in dor crônica from KOA.",

    "abstract": "This case illustrates the potential of the integrative, community-oriented approach implemented by Farol Integrative Healthy, a social enterprise focusing on promoção da saúde, autonomy, and engagement. It contributes to the literature by showing how complementary practices combined with rationalized medication use can reverse symptoms and reduce medication dependence in vulnerable communities. A 65-year-old Black woman, retired and living in a peripheral area, entered the Farol program through spontaneous demand. She presented chronic widespread pain (fibromyalgia), moderate to severe depressão, severe ansiedade, assessed by standardized inventories. She had a history of poor adherence, possible cognitive decline, and difficulty managing her medication. Entry into the Care Journey occurred in September 2024, with the administration: PROMIS and the Family Vulnerability Scale. The first clinical cycle (12 weeks) started in November, followed by a second cycle from March to June 2025. At the end of each cycle, additional assessments included the PSS, BAI, BDI, and an Integrative Pharmacy Questionnaire (self-developed). The patient presented with dor crônica and emotional imbalance. Integrative evaluations revealed deep energetic blocks and systemic disharmony. Ayurveda indicated aggravation of Vata (fibromyalgia, insomnia, dry skin), Pitta (hypertension, irritability), and Kapha (diabetes, obesity). TCM identified Kidney Yin and Yang deficiency, Spleen Qi and Blood deficiency, Liver Qi stagnation, Damp-Phlegm accumulation, and Cold-Wind obstruction. Treatment focused on promoting Qi and Blood flow, warming and tonifying Kidney and Heart, reducing Dampness and Phlegm. Warm diet, body therapies, and breathing practices supported vitality, emotional balance, and reduced inflammation. Interventions were delivered by a multidisciplinary team. The case manager provided individual sessions and coordinated 12 Mental Health Group meetings. The integrative practices professional applied auriculoterapia, meditação, cupping, aromaterapia, integrative art, fitoterapias, and therapeutic massage across nine sessions. The integrative pharmacist led six sessions to promote tratamento adherence and rational use of medicinal plants. Questionnaires showed significant improvement in Mental Health by 31.25% and Physical Health by 41.17%. The BAI score dropped by 44.44%, and the BDI shifted from moderate/severe depressão to absence of depressão. Metformin was reduced, and sertraline discontinued, reflecting a significant decrease in medication burden. This case highlights the benefits of a person-centered approach employing integrative practices alongside rational pharmacoterapia. The personalized strategy implemented by Farol facilitated a significant reversal of the clinical condition and promoted tangible improvements in health and qualidade de vida. Conclusion The case of O.C. da S. exemplifies how an individual-centered approach and integrative care can lead to significant positive clinical and psychosocial resultados, even in complex cases. Improvements in both physical and mental health conditions contribute to broader social and community well-being. This is supported by the patients testimony expressing a desire to re-engage in affectionate relationships and participate more actively in her community.",

    "abstract": "This case highlights the efetividade of a multidisciplinary, integrated approach that considers the person as a whole within their social context. The Farol model, implemented in Capão Redondo, focuses on person-centered care and integrative practices. The experience adds to growing evidence that community-based, integrative care can help ease mental suffering and dor crônica. The Care Journey program utilizes a multidisciplinary team, personalized intervençãos, and ongoing follow-up. The patient is a 48 White woman with epilepsy, moderate mental suffering, and dor crônica. She reports a history of ansiedade, depressão and family conflict. The patient started the Care Journey and completed two cycles of biweekly (Integrative Professional) and monthly (Pharmacist and Case Management) sessions. Quality of Life (PROMIS) and health resultado (BAI, BDI, BPI) questionnaires were applied at the start and end of each cycle. The patient experienced persistent physical pain and emotional distress. Integrative assessments revealed energetic imbalances impacting emotions, vitality, and well-being. Ayurvedic evaluation indicated Vata aggravation, with emotional instability, memory issues, and physical discomfort. Traditional Chinese Medicine identified Spleen Qi deficiency and Liver stagnation, causing weakness, low energy, and repressed emotions. The intervençãos were conducted by a transdisciplinary team composed of a Case Manager who provided individual follow-up and group care for Mental Health; a Integrative Health professional who offered multimodal theraphy including: auriculoterapia, integrative art, meditação, phytoterapia, Ayurvedic tratamento, and aromaterapia; and an Integrative Pharmacist who supported medication adherence and rational herbal use. During follow-up, the patient demonstrated greater self-awareness, a sense of purpose, and recognition of her limits. Medication and herbal adherence improved (Farmacological Natural Products), Quality of Life was increased by 12%, and ansiedade fell by 19.05% (from mild to minimal). She also engaged in cultural activities, dance classes, and psychology groups, strengthening ongoing care. The follow-up in the Care Journey, in coordination with Brazils Unified Health System, demonstrated progress in self-knowledge, emotional self-management, and recognition of risk factors. Territorial resources were well utilized and her support network expanded, reinforcing the integrative approachs role in promoting autonomy in vulnerable contexts. This case highlights how the Farol model provided significant health gains for a woman with multiple health demands through a transdisciplinary approach and articulation with SUS, thereby expanding possibilities for listening, intervenção, and patient empowerment.",

    "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a severe and chronic psychiatric condition that affects patients mental, emotional, and social functioning. In elderly individuals, this disorder becomes even more complex, as it impacts not only the patient but also their support network. One of the core symptoms of schizophrenia is thought disorder, which manifests through difficulties in formulating logical ideas, incoherent speech, and a loss of associative thinking, severely impairing communication and personal autonomy. This was a unique relato de casoed in the literature involving a diagnosis of schizophrenia and subsequent improvement in thought organization following the complementary use of Joel Aleixo System flower remedies, as confirmed by a new medical evaluation. A 73-year-old Brazilian woman, a retired elementary school teacher, was diagnosed with schizophrenia in 2007 after the death of her youngest daughter. She began experiencing hallucinations, delusions, memory problems, negative thoughts, agitation, insomnia, and aggression. Since then, she has been undergoing psychiatric tratamento, taking quetiapine and Haldol. Her oldest daughter began complementary tratamento with Joel Aleixo flower remedies in 2020, and after 40 days of tratamento, her diagnosis was changed to bipolar disorder, and she was started on carbolitium. After another 50 days, she was diagnosed with ansiedade and medicated only with 25mg of sertraline daily. 2007 - Diagnosis of schizophrenia, treated with quetiapine, Haldol, and risperidone. January 2020 - Starts flower terapia using the Joel Aleixo system, and her diagnosis changes to bipolar disorder. She begins using carbolithium and valproic acid. March 2020 - Continues flower terapia, and a new psychiatric evaluation reveals ansiedade. She is medicated with 25mg of sertraline. The patient had been medically diagnosed with schizophrenia for many years before using the Joel Aleixo flower terapia system. Subsequently, her medication was reduced, and the diagnosis was changed to bipolar affective disorder. She had retroocular headaches and underwent a CT angiogram, which revealed a normal brain mass but a small aneurysm in the left ophthalmic artery. The selection of flower essences in the Joel Aleixo system is more complex than in other floral systems. There are protocol formulas for cleansing feminine energy, which represent the first phase, lasting 50 days and using essences of anthurium, bromeliad, tibouchina, geranium, lantana, pansy, plumbago, and marigold. The second phase, also lasting 50 days, uses essences of aloe vera, geranium, sunflower, azalea, bracatinga, mandacaru, amaryllis, geranium, and hibiscus. Her aggression and breaking attacks improved, she developed organized thinking, and was able to hold conversations with discernment, which improved her social interactions. She also began to cooperate with household chores and even started cooking again. Present in Brazil for over 30 years and recognized by the Unified Health System (SUS) as an integrative practice since 2018, these essences still lack scientific validation. There are no bibliographic reports, to date, that demonstrate statistical relevance, but this does not mean that the results do not exist; it simply demonstrates the need for scientific studies.",

    "abstract": "This relato de caso describes the application of the Biomolecular VibroIntegration (BVI) method, developed by Evadison Soares Braga, in a 66-year-old female patient with coronary artery disease and persistent multisystemic symptoms. The intervenção aimed to restore homeostasis and vitality through resonant breathing, reflex touch, vagal stimulation, and aromaterapia. Symptoms resolved between May 18 and 27. Complementary sessions were conducted until June 13. The intervenção promoted emotional stabilization, functional improvement, and return to routine. This case reinforces the clinical efetividade of BVI as a complementary tool for neurophysiological modulation and integrative well-being. This case is unique for demonstrating the integral response of a patient with cardiovascular condition and chronic symptoms to the Biomolecular VibroIntegration (BVI) techniquea Brazilian method that integrates breathing, sensory stimulation, and body-mind reconnection. The clinical result, with no adverse events, reinforces its value as a therapeutic adjuvant in scenarios with poor response to drug monoterapia. Female patient, 66 years old, retired, treated in an integrative clinic. Complaints: dizziness, chronic rhinitis, joint pain, fatigue, heartburn, swelling in limbs and fingers, muscle tension, and ansiedade. Medical history includes CAD with stents, hypertension, and continuous medication use. Examination showed unstable blood pressure, edema, and self-reported ansiedade level of 10. No laboratory tests were conducted for this cycle of care. 05/1805/27: 10 full daily sessions 06/02: reinforcement session 06/10: guided breathing (20 min) + Breathe inhalation (10 min) 06/13: final consolidation session Clinical and functional evaluation. Primary diagnosis: autonomic dysfunction associated with CAD. Symptoms compatible with a heightened sympathetic pattern. The integrative approach was chosen due to symptom recurrence despite medication adherence. No complementary tests were necessary during the sessions. BVI combined resonant breathing (57 bpm), vagus nerve stimulation through prolonged exhalation, reflex touch, and functional aromaterapia. Sessions lasted approximately 60 minutes. From the 3rd session, the patient reported significant symptom improvement. By the 10th session, she reported returning to normal life. The technique was adapted with a respiratory focus on June 10 and 13. Complete resolution of symptoms: elimination of dizziness, swelling, joint pain, and digestive discomfort. Anxiety reduced from 10 to 0. Breathing, sleep, and mental focus were restored. No efeitos adversos. High adherence to self-care recommendations and continued guided breathing at home. BVI acts on the autonomic nervous system by modulating the respiratory and sensory axis. By increasing CO tolerance, it reduces respiratory rate and promotes parasympathetic activation. The results support the techniques use as a complementary tool in primary and outpatient care. Limitation: single case study. Further investigation is suggested in larger groups with objective indicators.",

    "abstract": "Cardiac arrhythmias often involve complex interactions between physiological, emotional, and energetic factors. Although conventional tratamentos aim to pharmacologically stabilize the heart rhythm, emotional dysregulation, insomnia, and ansiedade often remain unsolved. This relato de caso describes the integrative and complementary therapeutic process of a 41-year-old patient with severe ventricular arrhythmia, using the Joel Aleixo Floral System combined with conventional cardiological tratamento. A 41-year-old Brazilian male mail carrier presented with dizziness, pre-syncope, and fatigue lasting two months. He was diagnosed with severe ventricular arrhythmia and began tratamento with amiodarone while awaiting an electrophysiological study. He also suffered from chronic insomnia, ansiedade, night sweats, nightmares, and long-term constipation. He would wake up in a panic, with palpitations and overwhelming emotional exhaustion. To complement conventional tratamento and avoid invasive intervençãos, he began a complementary protocol with the Joel Aleixo flower terapia system. Month 0: Diagnosis confirmed by 24-hour Holter. Antiarrhythmic terapia with amiodarone initiated. Month 13: Start of flower terapia. Emotional symptoms improved, though intense dreams persisted. Month 46: Marked clinical improvementnormalization of sleep, cessation of nightmares and arrhythmia symptoms, increased emotional stability. Month 6+: Amiodarone was safely discontinued under cardiological supervision. Holter repeatedno recurrence of arrhythmias. Diagnosis of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia on 24-hour holter, in addition to ansiedade, dizziness, presyncope, panic and nocturnal agitation. There are protocol formulas, representing the first phase, lasting 60 days, using essences of anthurium, bromeliad, tibouchina, geranium, lantana, pansy, plumbago, and calendula. The second phase, also lasting 60 days, uses essences of aloe vera, geranium, sunflower, azalea, bracatinga, mandacaru, amaryllis, geranium, and hibiscus. Significant improvements were observed: reduced ansiedade, normalized sleep, cessation of nightmares and symptoms of arrhythmia. The cardiologist suspended the amiodarone and, at the patient's request, repeated the Holter monitoring after 15 days to completely eliminate the antiarrhythmic requirements. The patient remained asymptomatic and returned to normal daily activities, including work, with restored emotional resilience. He repeated the 24-hour Holter monitoring, which no longer showed any arrhythmias. He continues to be monitored by a cardiologist and, after 3 years, there was no need to resume the use of antiarrhythmics. This case highlights the potential role of Joel Aleixo's floral remedies in treating the emotional and energetic roots of cardiovascular dysfunction. By integrating vibrational medicine with conventional tratamento, the patient achieved emotional regulation and physical stabilization without additional pharmacological dependence. Although relato de casos do not allow for generalizations, the observed results suggest that energetic therapies can aid neurocardiac homeostasis. This reinforces the importance of integrating Traditional and Complementary Medicine (TCM) into multidisciplinary care. Present in Brazil for over 30 years and recognized by the Unified Health System (SUS) as an integrative practice since 2018, these essences still lack sufficient scientific validation.",

    "abstract": "Autoimmune dermatitis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease that significantly impacts patients qualidade de vida, especially when resistant to conventional tratamentos. This relato de caso presents the complementary use of Joel Aleixos alchemical flower essences in a patient with chronic autoimmune dermatitis. It highlights the role of the terapia in improving physical symptoms and emotional wellbeing, including the restoration of self-esteem and renewed family engagement. C.P., a 37-year-old, Brazilian, dentist, was diagnosed with autoimmune dermatitis during childhood. Throughout her life, she had consulted over 100 physicians with limited results. At the time of the initial integrative evaluation, she presented with painful open skin lesions under her fingernails caused by glove talc, diffuse white patches on her legs and body exacerbated by sun exposure, pruritus in the nipple area (associated with fungal infection), and generalized skin vulnerability to bacterial and fungal agents. She reported persistent pain during work due to discomfort and skin fragility, affecting her self-esteem and motivation. Childhood to adulthood: Chronic dermatitis; multiple medical consultations with no remission. Months 02: Integrative consultation; Phase 1 of floral terapia initiated, along with topical creams (cleansing and protection, joy, and wellbeing). Rapid reduction in skin pain and itching; visible skin healing began. Months 34: Phase 2 of floral terapia initiated. Continued dermatological improvement and significant emotional and social progress. The diagnosis of autoimmune dermatitis was confirmed through dermatological history and clinical observation. Secondary fungal infections and cutaneous hypersensitivity were confirmed by biopsy, scraping, and fungal culture. Energetic assessment included analysis of chakra and elemental imbalances. The selection of flower essences in the Joel Aleixo system is more complex than in other floral systems. There are protocol formulas for cleansing feminine energy, representing the first phase, lasting 50 days, using essences of anthurium, bromeliad, tibouchina, geranium, lantana, pansy, plumbago, and calendula. The second phase, also lasting 50 days, uses essences of aloe vera, geranium, sunflower, azalea, bracatinga, mandacaru, amaryllis, geranium, and hibiscus. Significant clinical improvements were observed, including 100% resolution of pruritus, 100% healing of open lesions on the hands, and 80% improvement in hypopigmented patches on the legs within the first two weeks of tratamento. Self-esteem improved. The patient returned to work pain-free and resumed outdoor activities and sun exposure without efeitos adversos. Photographic documentation before and after tratamento confirmed substantial dermatological recovery and increased vitality. Although recognized by SUS since 2018, Joel Aleixo's floral terapia lacks robust scientific studies. This case suggests benefits for immunity, skin, and emotional balance. It is essential to expand research to validate its efetividade and fully integrate this practice into conventional clinical protocols.",

    "abstract": "Autoimmune polymyositis combined with cutaneous psoriasis presents diagnostic and therapeutic complexity, often requiring long-term immunosuppressive tratamento. This case explores the role of classical Ayurvedic intervençãos in managing such chronic inflammation, systemic degeneration, and drug-induced toxicity including Ayurvedic principles and Rasayana-based formulations. A 48-year-old female with a 15-year history of rheumatoid arthritis (RA-negative) and biopsy-confirmed polymyositis brought by relatives to clinic with debilitating joint pain, muscular weakness, and ulcerated psoriasis on palms and soles. Long-term methotrexate and corticosteroid usage prompted concerns about hepatotoxicity and systemic imbalance, despite relatively normal biochemical markers. Week 03: Oral administration of highly individualized herbal powders and other Ayurvedic preparations. Methotrexate was tapered and discontinued by the end of Week 3. Week 4: Visible drying of Stravi Vrana and improvement in appetite and energy levels. - Patient underwent a 10-day Basti Karma protocol - Week 7 onward: Continued recovery with restored mobility, normalized CRP and LFTs, and improved psychological well-being. Clinical Ayurvedic diagnosis included Vata-Kapha Pradhana Kushta, Twak Dushti, and Shotha, with underlying Gara Visha pathology. Symptoms matched classical descriptions from texts such as Charaka Samhita with clear signs of Sannipata involvement and also Jeerna vyadhi(Chronic status), weakened Dhatu Bala and Agni increase the challeges in tratamento. According to modern perspective patient was consuming Methotrexate 15mg and omnacortil for more than12 years. Which underlines metabolic disturbances and hepatotoxicity. Treatment was highly individualized including oral administration of a personalized Ayurvedic preparation of herbal powders and some standard Ancient Ayurvedic preparations such as Gandhak Rasayana, Panchatikta Guggulu Ghrita. The tratamento started with Pachana, Pitta- Kaphaghna medications and after that Shodhana(Detox tratamento) and finally Rasayana (Rejuvination). After 3 weeks, methotrexate was tapered and discontinued. Follow-up involved 10 days of Basti Karma using classical Shodhana and Rasayana formulations. Marked improvement in skin lesions- cessation of Stravi Vrana (wounds become healthy with no discharge), restored mobility, improved appetite, and normalized lab markers (CRP, LFTs). The patient reported better psychological well-being and regained independence in walking. No adverse events were noted. This case illustrates how individualized, Rasayana-based Ayurvedic tratamento can offer a viable alternative for autoimmune disease management.Identifying underlying causes, assessment of Dosha and Vyadhi Awastha (Staging of disease) is always a key. It calls for broader clinical validation and integration of traditional approaches into global health systems, especially in chronic, refractory conditions.",

    "abstract": "This study is relevant to the current Health System, because it approaches tools and different care outlooks, and considers the biopsychosocial and spiritual health, as is proposed by the World Health Organization¹. The convergence between Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and Nursing, by means of millenarian practices and the use of Energetic and Nursing Diagnosis, considers a Beings integrality. 68 year old woman, retired; carrier of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD), no hemodialysis; SAH and MTHFR mutation. Widow and mother of a son with intellectual and physical deficiencies. Aggressive family loss history. Main complaints: CKD symptoms; pain and distress. 04/03/24 - Anamnesis / Initial physical exam 06-15/03/24- Treatment - 10 sessions 26/03/24- Anamnesis / Final physical exam Medical diagnosis (CKD, SAH, MTHFR mutation). Complementary tratamento with acupuntura, moxibustion and bloodletting (auricular points). The study optimized kidney function (12-14%), interrupted 28,6% of physical symptoms and reduced 46,6% of physical/psychological symptoms. It also reduced 57% of the Energetic Diagnosis and 17,8% of Real Nursing Diagnosis (problems), and increased in 250% the Nursing Diagnosis of promoção da saúde. The study contributed to the field of Integrative Practices in Health, and used TCM tools. There was clinical improvement from the patient, that presented reduced physical and psychological symptoms, as well as Energetic and Nursing Diagnosis. Optimized kidney function confirmed by laboratorial exams. This record can contribute with the current conservative tratamento and the prorogation of future hemodialysis, safely, using acupuntura as a complementary tratamento to the conventional one². Limitations: emergence of new physical symptoms (patients fall) and non-alteration of psychological complaints, such as feeling helpless, distress (dementia, health risks, death, decreased functionalities) and fear. This proves the vulnerability of an elderly patient, with chronic disorders and challenging family dynamics. The psychic dimension needs more time to a professional/patient link and auto-perception. Its necessary to develop an amplified view of the health-disease process and the global promotion of human care, especially self-care³. However, sadness was reduced, revealing that acupuntura reduces damage, solves problems and favors qualidade de vida. Also, its extremely relevant in the context of preventive medicine, because energy renewal, aid in physical and emotional balance, and stimulus to self-care and self knowledge that change the perception of life, are other benefits associated with acupuntura4. Conclusion: the case study increased the patients qualidade de vida, and keeping the continuous acupuntura sessions favors her conservative tratamento of CDK. Acupuncture is a promotion of well-being5. Main lesson: clinical expertise gained by experiencing TCM contribution to a challenging reality of chronic disease and family dynamics. The possibility to prorogue future hemodialysis, safely, was a professional and personal accomplishment.",

It also has an aesthetic stigma for affected patients, occurring in women at a ratio of 2 in every 10 female patients. In this study, intramuscular and subcutaneous sessions of Traumeel injections (arnica montana plus others componentes) (tabela 1) were used to lipedema tratamento in a woman on early menopause in hormonal replacement terapia. Sessions of Traumeel injectables were carried out wekkly in both legs. Between local injectable sessions, manual massage terapia and lymphatic drainage were performed -two sessions. A total of three tratamento cycles were carried out over a sixty day period. The patient was advised to follow a Mediterranean low-carb diet and engage in regular exercise with the assistance of a physical trainer. D.S.C, 49 years old, early menopause at 46 years old, complained of worsening leg appearance after menopause, painful legs, especially at night, frequent bruising without a clear cause, and persistent fat accumulation in the legs despite diet and exercise. The only tratamento performed for lipedema before was locals massages  Lipedema Grade II, affecting hips, legs, and arms  Obesity Grade II Family History: mother, maternal aunt and grandmother  lipedema Woman - 49 years old in early menopause - 46 years old, complained of worsening leg appearance after menopause, painful legs, especially at night, frequent bruising without a clear cause, and persistent fat accumulation in the legs Diagnosis of lipedema performed by clinical examination in a doctor's office The therapeutic intervenção was the use of Traumeel - Arnica Montana subcutaneus and intramuscular Day 1/21/42: Traumeel injectables 0.3 mL per point, injected into hips and thighs using a 13.0 x 0.30 mm hypodermic needle Day 1/8/21/27/42/49: Traumeel IM injection A total of three tratamento cycles were carried out over a sixty day period. Excellent aesthetic result. Increased patient self esteem. Less local pain in affected areas. The clinical diagnostic is still lipedema grade II. The adverse efects were pain and transient bruising at the sites of subcutaneous applications Lipedema is an inflamatory disease and it could get worse after menopause, like in our patient. Lipedema tends to deteriorate during major hormonal fluctuations (doi 10.3390/ijms222111720) Components of Traumeel are of plant, mineral and other organicorigin, diluted to so-called low potencies. The exact mechanisms of action are not known, but a number of studies suggest anti-inflammatory , antioxidative, and chondroprotective properties, Inhibiting inflammation signaling genes, cell stress and damage markers, microRNAs, cell mobility indicators, extracellular matrix components, keratins, collagens and several previously uncharacterized genes (doi 10.1016/j.eujim.2017.07.005) The use of Traumeel may be a good option for lipedema tratamento thinking about de imminently inflamatory aspect of the disease, a painfull and chronical genetic disease",

    "abstract": "Ocular melanoma with adrenal and pulmonary metastases is uncommon and lacks clearly effective systemic options. This case describes a rare complete remission following integrative terapia that included a Pleurotus-based vibrational floral remedy and off-label immunoterapia. A 64-year-old woman with a history of metastatic ocular melanoma, previously treated with hepatic and lymph node resections (20092011), presented in early 2022 with nonspecific abdominal discomfort. She had no relevant family history or comorbidities. Physical examination revealed only mild tenderness in the right upper quadrant. Prior BRAF testing showed no mutations. She was functionally independent, with no systemic or neurological symptoms. - 20092011: Ocular melanoma with hepatic, abdominal wall, and cervical metastases; multiple resections and radioterapia - February 2022: MRI showed large adrenal mass (110 × 92 × 70 mm) invading liver, kidney, and vena cava - March 1, 2022: Initiated Floral de Yana (10 drops, four times daily) - March 2, 2022: PET/CT showed high uptake in adrenal (SUV 10.7) and pulmonary lesion (SUV 10.3) - April 20, 2022: Started Ipilimumab + Nivolumab - July 2022March 2023: Imaging showed gradual regression and stabilization - March 2024: Adrenalectomy revealed no residual tumor Initial imaging revealed a voluminous adrenal lesion with contiguous invasion. PET/CT demonstrated intense metabolic activity, suggesting active metastasis. Differential diagnoses included adrenal carcinoma and recurrent melanoma. Given the tumor size and vascular involvement, surgery was not indicated. Histopathology post-adrenalectomy in 2024 revealed only an organized hematoma. The prognosis at onset was considered poor due to metastatic burden and lack of standard therapeutic options. The patient initiated Floral de Yana, a vibrational terapia derived from the energetic signature of the Pleurotus genus. The remedy does not contain pharmacologically active compounds and was used with the goal of promoting systemic energetic harmonization. Immunoterapia with ipilimumab and nivolumab was initiated after 50 days, with no dosage changes. No additional oncologic therapies were administered during this period. Imaging performed from July 2022 onward showed progressive tumor shrinkage and partial cavitation, with eventual lesion stabilization. No new metastases were identified. The adrenal mass, previously considered inoperable, was surgically removed in March 2024 and confirmed free of viable tumor. Treatment was well tolerated with no adverse events. Patient adherence remained consistent throughout the follow-up period. The early tumor response, prior to the full expected effect of immunoterapia, raises the hypothesis of a synergistic or immune-priming effect from the vibrational terapia. While causality cannot be proven, this observation invites further research. The case highlights the potential of integrative therapies as adjuncts in oncology, particularly when conventional strategies are limited. Conclusion: In cases of advanced melanoma with limited therapeutic options, integrative vibrational therapies may provide additional clinical value and merit further investigation.",

    "abstract": "Chronic musculoskeletal pain is highly prevalent in primary healthcare, often resulting in excessive pharmacological tratamento, especially in saúde pública systems with high care demands. Integrative approaches such as auriculoterapia and dry needling have shown promising results for pain management, yet remain underreported in public atenção primária services. This relato de caso presents the application of both techniques in a Brazilian Family Health Strategy service. A 78-year-old woman presented with severe chronic dorsal pain, worsened over three months after the death of a close friend. She reported insomnia, emotional distress, and increased use of benzodiazepines and analgesics. Medical history included systemic hypertension and osteoarthritis. No relevant genetic conditions were reported. Three months before consultation: bereavement and pain worsening. First consultation: pain 10/10 (VAS), insomnia, and medication overuse. Weeks 16: weekly integrative sessions. Week 6: pain reduced to 3/10 (VAS), improved sleep, reduced medication use. Physical examination revealed paravertebral muscle tension, multiple trigger points in the upper thoracic and cervical regions, and restricted cervical spine range of motion. No laboratory or imaging exams were requested due to clinical criteria and resource limitations. The diagnosis was chronic myofascial dorsalgia associated with emotional distress. Differential diagnoses considered included osteoarticular degeneration and neuropathic pain, deemed unlikely based on clinical presentation. Weekly sessions combining NADA auriculoterapia protocol (Shen Men, Sympathetic, Kidney, Liver, Lung points) with dry needling in cervical and dorsal trigger points were performed over six weeks. Psychosocial support and health education complemented the approach. Progressive pain reduction and improved sleep were noted. By the sixth week, the patient reported a decrease in pain to 3/10 (VAS), reduced use of benzodiazepines and analgesics, and improved emotional well-being. No efeitos adversos occurred, and the patient expressed satisfaction with her qualidade de vida improvement. This case illustrates the feasibility, segurança, and clinical benefits of integrating auriculoterapia and dry needling into public primary healthcare. These low-cost, baseado em evidence practices contributed to effective symptom control, medication reduction, and increased patient autonomy, reinforcing their value in overburdened public services. Conclusion: Integrative practices proved effective and accessible for managing chronic musculoskeletal pain in public atenção primária, promoting rational medication use and comprehensive patient care.",

    "abstract": "This case describes the complementary use of papaya leaf tea to support recovery from post-dengue thrombocytopenia in an 18-year-old Jamaican athlete. Sourced from the GWG Organic Research Station, the tea was home-administered. While papaya has been studied in Southeast Asia and India, this case adds to the limited clinical documentation from the Caribbean. A previously healthy, national-level athlete, underwent routine blood testing on 23 June 2025. Initially asymptomatic, she subsequently developed a high fever. No relevant medical history, prior intervençãos, or physical exam findings were reported. Thrombocytopenia was noted on 23rd June 2025. Papaya tea was started 24 June and continued for four days. On 27 June, platelets reached 235 × 10/L. Labs showed platelets at 98 x10/L (150400 x10/L), white blood cell (WBC) count at 3.8 x10/L (4.011.0 x10/L), red cell distribution width (RDW) at 13.2% (11.514.5%), and a positive Dengue IgG. No diagnostic challenges were reported. Results suggested resolving post-dengue thrombocytopenia with favourable prognosis. Papaya tea was prepared by boiling 24 g of dried leaves in 500 mL water and straining. Doses of 3050 mL were given two to three times daily for 3-4 days. Prepared fresh each day, it was administered under parental supervision. Platelets increased from 98 to 235 x10/L and WBC count normalized from 3.8 to 6.8 x10/L within four days. Follow-up results showed slight elevations in mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration (35.8 g/dL) and RDW (13.4%), likely training-related. Adherence and tolerability were confirmed by parental report, with no adverse events noted. The strength of this case lies in the rapid platelet recovery observed in an active individual, though it is limited by its single-case design. Indian studies from 20162025, support the potential of papaya leaf tea to boost platelets. Phytochemicals in the tea may enhance thrombopoiesis post-dengue. While causality cannot be confirmed, the timeline and absence of co-intervençãos suggest a possible therapeutic effect. This case highlights the potential of this culturally relevant, plant-based remedy as an adjunct in dengue recovery. Papaya leaf tea may aid post dengue platelet recovery but should be used with medical oversight and evaluated through further study.",

This novel integrative approach mitigated withdrawal symptoms and improved core fibromyalgia symptoms, adding to scientific literature on Erythrina mulungu's segurança and efficacy in complex poly-symptomatic patients. A 50-year-old postmenopausal woman presented with chronic ansiedade, severe insomnia, and widespread fibromyalgia pain, significantly impacting her life. She had a five-year history of clonazepam (2 mg/day) and prior unsuccessful attempts at reduction. Validated assessments showed moderate ansiedade (GAD-7: 12), moderately severe insomnia (ISI: 16), and moderate fibromyalgia impact (FIQ-R: 50). Clonazepam (2 mg/day) initiated 5 years prior. Fibromyalgia diagnosed 3 years prior. At Month 0, clonazepam tapering began with Erythrina mulungu introduction. Clonazepam was gradually tapered (switching to liquid at Month 2). The Mulungu dose was carefully adjusted, with an increase at Month 3.5 during the final withdrawal phase to optimize symptom control, and a subsequent reduction in the morning dose to address daytime drowsiness. Clonazepam was completely discontinued at Month 4. Follow-up to Month 6 showed significant symptom improvements. Diagnosis relied on DSM-5 criteria for Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Chronic Insomnia, and ACR 2010 criteria for Fibromyalgia. Validated patient-reported resultado measures (GAD-7, ISI, FIQ-R) were used at baseline and follow-up. No significant diagnostic challenges were encountered. Prognosis for benzodiazepine cessation was initially guarded but improved with Mulungu. Intervention combined gradual clonazepam tapering (from 2 mg/day, transitioning to liquid) with titrated Erythrina mulungu tincture (1:5, Brazilian Pharmacopoeia). Initial Mulungu dose was 30 drops/day, adjusted to 45 drops/day during peak withdrawal, and subsequently modified for tolerability by reducing the morning dose to minimize daytime drowsiness. Patient education was also provided. Over six months, clonazepam was successfully discontinued. Significant improvements were observed: GAD-7 reduced from 12 to 5, ISI from 16 to 7, and FIQ-R from 50 to 15. The patient reported enhanced concentration, energy, reduced pain, and improved mood. Adherence was excellent, and Mulungu was well-tolerated, with transient drowsiness being the only adverse event, resolved by dose adjustment. This case demonstrates Erythrina mulungu's role as a safe, effective adjunct in managing ansiedade, insomnia, and fibromyalgia, particularly aiding benzodiazepine withdrawal. Strengths include detailed longitudinal follow-up and validated measures. Limitations include its single-patient nature, preventing generalization. Preclinical studies support Mulungu's anxiolytic, sedative, and analgesic properties. The case advocates for integrating TCIM for holistic chronic care.",

    "abstract": "Hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) is a viral infection caused by human enteroviruses or coxsackieviruses, usually self-limiting, characterized by low-grade fever, painful oral ulcerations, and a maculopapular or papulovesicular rash on the hands and feet (Saguil et al., 2019). Down syndrome (DS) is a genetic condition caused by the presence of a third copy of chromosome 21 (Mustacchi, 2020). Children with DS, or trisomy 21 (T21), present unique dermatological and immunological characteristics that can affect the progression and severity of infections (Bull, 2011). Since HFMD has no specific antiviral tratamento, this relato de caso explores the topical use of geranium essential oil (GEO) and tea tree essential oil (TTEO) as a complementary approach in a child with DS. According to the parents, the child had a history of atopic dermatitis, was clinically diagnosed with HFMD by the pediatrician, and Down syndrome was confirmed by karyotyping, revealing free trisomy 21. The 21-month-old male presented with typical lesions on the throat, hands, and feet, as well as legs, elbows, and diaper area, along with irritability, but without secondary infection. He remained afebrile and maintained good oral intake. The aromaterapia protocol was initiated following the clinical diagnosis. Between days 3 and 5, progressive improvement was observed. By the seventh day, the lesions were nearly completely healed. HFMD was clinically diagnosed based on typical findings. No laboratory or imaging tests were requested. The case progressed with a favorable prognosis. A topical blend was prepared using 1 drop of TTEO (Melaleuca alternifolia, steam-distilled from the leaves), and 1 drop of GEO (Pelargonium graveolens, steam-distilled from the aerial parts), both were diluted in 10 mL of cold-pressed grapeseed carrier oil (Vitis vinifera), resulting in a 1% concentration. The formulation was applied topically to the lesions three times daily for ten days. No changes were made to the protocol. The parents reported improvement in the lesions, including reduced erythema, decreased irritability, and improved sleep. The topical application was well tolerated, with no adverse events. Treatment adherence was complete, and overall well-being improved. In addition to DS-related features, a history of atopic dermatitis may have increased his susceptibility to more extensive viral skin involvement (Silverberg, 2003). While HFMD typically resolves spontaneously, aromaterapia may offer faster symptom relief and improved comfort. The blend followed pediatric segurança, with 1% dilution appropriate for this age group (Tisserand & Young, 2014), and scientific evidence: geraniol in GEO showed in vitro antiviral activity against Coxsackievirus B1 (Mileva et al., 2015), while TTEO, although ineffective against Coxsackievirus B1 (Garozzo et al., 2009), was included for its antimicrobial potential (Shao et al., 2021). Clinical reports on HFMD in children with DS are limited, especially in the context of aromaterapia. Further studies are needed to better understand therapeutic responses in this population.",

Thus, disharmonies of the heart can manifest signs and symptoms such as chest tightness, cyanosis of the lips and nails, and fear of losing control,1 which can appear subtly during pregnancy P. V., 41 years old, businesswoman, pregnant, secundiparous, IVF pregnancy, with chronic hypertension, ansiedade, and emotional trauma due to the loss of a previous pregnancy as a result of eclampsia. The patient was admitted to the hospital at 27 weeks' gestation to control her blood pressure and was prescribed antihypertensive drugs and anticoagulants. The aim was to help control blood pressure and ansiedade in a pregnant woman using TCM. TCM was chosen by the multi-professional team and started twice a week using Systemic Acupuncture and Auriculoterapia. The acupuncturist trained the husband to perform bloodletting at the apex of the ears whenever the pressure rose above (130 X 80mmhg). Acupuncture and auriculoterapia sessions with needles were associated with medical management, during the hospitalization of the pregnant woman, continuous medications were maintained. The resources of complementary medicine help in controlling blood pressure. The evaluation of the semiology of the tongue and measurement of blood pressure measured were used as an instrument to measure the clinical conduct during the sessions. The auriculoterapia acupoints with systemic needles used were: Shen Men, Kidney, Spleen-Pancreas, Heart, Hypothalamus and Neurasthenia. The systemic acupoints used during the sessions were: LV2, KI9, Yintang, LI11, HT7, LU9, PC6 and GV20. The tratamento, using integrative practices, was carried out for 4 consecutive weeks in conjunction with allopathic tratamento. lthough the patient maintained a blood pressure of 170x100 mmhg several times a day, evolving into Eclampsia-Help Syndrome at 31 weeks' gestation, there was an improvement in blood flow, verified through the measurement of blood pressure and in the control of ansiedade, through the patient's report and self-perception. These results were provided by MCT, which, although it doesn't rule out the causes, manages to minimize exacerbations, help the body, and balance it. In addition, it should be noted that the preterm birth was prolonged by 4 weeks, maintaining a controlled resultado for mother and baby, who had no neurological impairment in the postpartum period Although there is still a small sample of studies, the results recommend the use of integrative and complementary practices, which can reduce stress and ansiedade, thus helping to reduce blood pressure. We need to encourage the use of integrative and complementary practices to reduce blood pressure, one of the causes of maternal and infant mortality.",

    "abstract": "Perimenopausal symptoms complaints are frequent demands in reports from female patients. The perimenopause period involves hormonal fluctuations that may cause hot flashes, fatigue, mood swings, and insomnia. In TCM, this stage is seen as a natural decline of Jing (ancestral Qi), often resulting in Kidney Yin deficiency and relative Yang excessa pattern referred to as false fire. While there is no direct herbal equivalent to the Western diagnosis of perimenopause, TCM offers some formulas to address symptom patterns. Liuwei Dihuang Wan is commonly used to nourish Kidney Yin and Liver and reduce internal heat. A 46-year-old woman, during her perimenopausal phase, severe hot flashes, cold feet, fatigue, insomnia, irritability, poor concentration and itchy skin. Cholecystectomy in 2017 and bariatric surgery in 2018, procedures that may contribute to Qi deficiency. Contraceptives use. One year before consultation, she began experiencing fatigue, cold feet, and palpitations. Not menstruated for several years due to contraceptive, difficult to determine her menopausal status. Normal hormone levels, symptoms of perimenopause. Six months prior, reported increased irritability and insomnia with frequent nighttime awakenings. TCM uses tongue and pulse assessment as diagnostic tools. Through them we may identify alterations in the flow of Qi. At first consultation, the tongue was swelling, indicating phlegm and Qi stagnation; teeth marks on the sides, supporting the pattern of dampness accumulation and Liver Qi stagnation; petechiae, indicating blood stasis; and scant coating with a slightly yellowish color, pointing to a pattern of Kidney Yin Deficiency and the presence of internal heat. Weak and deep pulse on both sides, full in Spleen position, and tense in Liver the position: also indicates Qi Deficiency, with dampness accumulation and Liver Qi stagnation. Diagnosis: ascension of false heat due to Kidney Yin Deficiency and Liver Qi Stagnation, with Spleen Deficiencya pattern commonly in perimenopause. Prescribed Liuwei Dihuang Wan, 200 mg twice daily for 10 days. Increased to 200 mg three times daily for a total tratamento period of 45 days. Initial in-person consultation, followed by weekly remote follow-ups. After 30 days, a new in-person assessment was conducted, followed by additional weekly remote contacts. The patient adhered to the tratamento. The criteria for evaluating of perimenopause-related symptoms included the patients self-reports. reported menstrual spotting, sign of improved blood circulation, recovery of Kidney Deficiency, and unobstructed flow of Liver. After 45 days, extremities were warmer, suggesting possible improvement in Kidney Yin Deficiency. Also significant improvement in psychological symptoms, cognition and enhanced sleep quality. Benefits were maintained, with no adverse events. For Lo Der-Chen (2008) Liuwei Dihuang formula regulates energetic imbalances seen during perimenopause. Although there is no specific Chinese herbal formula to the Western diagnoses of perimenopause, TCM offers herbal tratamentos to the symptoms reported by patients. Results were positive, although it was a single case. Broader studies are needed to validate TCM efetividade for perimenopausal symptoms. Strengthening dialogue between TCM and Western medicine is crucial for advancing integrative care.",

The project's objectives include promoting a holistic approach to mental and physical well-being, fostering knowledge exchange, and training healthcare professionals with a broader and more humanized perspective. Activities and Methodology. The project's main activities include: Auriculoterapia: Treatments are offered twice a week, using a specific protocol of nine auricular points from Traditional Chinese Medicine: She Men, Sympathetic Nervous System, Kidney, Liver, Spleen, Pancreas, Heart, Occipital, Neurasthenia, and Anxiety. This approach aims to integrate ansiedade tratamento based on physiology and TCM diagnosis. Collective Body Practices: The project also offers practices such as Tai Chi Chuan, Qi Gong, Circle Dance, Yoga, and Meditation, which complement individual intervençãos. Acupuncture: Five acupuntura sessions are offered per shift, twice a week, performed by trained professionals. It is important to emphasize that the project does not aim to make clinical diagnoses of mental health problems. Rather, it meets the spontaneous demand of users seeking relief from physical and emotional pain, many of whom already have prior diagnoses and are referred by qualified health professionals. The project team includes the active participation of 10 students, who receive initial training on the principles of Traditional Chinese Medicine and auriculoterapia protocols for ansiedade. One of the challenges identified during the project's implementation is balancing outreach activities with the students' acadêmico lives. Data collection is conducted through Google Forms, administered after each session, with open- and closed-ended questions. The results are presented qualitativoly and quantitatively, with the qualitativo data interpreted based on Bardin's (2006) content analysis methodology. This outreach project represents an initiative to integrate TCIM into public and university health contexts, contributing to the dissemination of complementary practices and the training of professionals committed to a comprehensive approach to healthcare. The applicability of TCIM has increased as the world becomes increasingly fluid (BAUMAN, 2012), bringing a lot of instability and liquidity to affective, social, and professional relationships. This leads to the belief that the absence of solid and lasting structures can compromise and aggravate interpersonal and family relationships, resulting in conflicts in affective and professional relationships. This fact has contributed to ansiedade disorders, adding different problems to physical and mental health, demanding the integration of shared knowledge and specializations to meet the vicissitudes of the modern world. However, modernity has brought advances and proposals for innovation in the health field, which can also be understood as an expression of a movement that identifies with new ways of learning and practicing health, as these practices are characterized by interdisciplinarity and unique languages (TELESI JUNIOR, 2016).The project can be sustainable in the long term and potentially viable to serve a larger number of people. Furthermore, exploring possible partnerships with local health agencies or other institutions would ensure the strengthening and greater engagement of the community in adopting the practices. University outreach activities play an important role in the dialectical communication between academia and the community, contributing to knowledge and promoção da saúde in diverse contexts. This study describes outreach activities focused on integrative practices, carried out at two strategic locations in the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil: the Dr. Guilherme Romano Polyclinic and the Idomed Città Campus. A total of 161 auriculoterapia sessions were recorded, in addition to acupuntura and bodywork sessions, with proposed therapeutic interactions with the community. The results accumulated since the project's inception indicate a total of 161 auriculoterapia sessions, complemented by acupuntura and bodywork sessions. During data collection, participants reported predominant complaints of ansiedade, insomnia, muscle pain, and difficulty maintaining focus and concentration. Participant testimonials highlight the positive impact of the sessions on individual health, with emphasis on the promotion of self-care. The perception of improvement and the individuals' protagonism in their own health recovery reinforce the benefits of these intervençãos. At the same time, the project has contributed to the development of extension students. Increased autonomy and professional responsibility have been observed, as well as a deeper understanding of Traditional Medicine and integrative practices. The application of the Person-Centered Clinical Method, with the use of tools to establish effective communication and sensitive listening, has enhanced the students' ability to provide humane and comprehensive care. The patient-centered approach and integration with saúde pública policies reinforce the importance and impact of these initiatives. The project not only provides relief from ansiedade-related complaints but also empowers individuals to practice self-care, contributing to the development of professionals with a broader and more humane view of care. The following recommendations are proposed to strengthen and optimize the impact of the project: Continuous training, promotion of workshops and seminars for students and teachers, with the participation of specialists in Complementary and Integrative Health Practices, in order to deepen the theoretical and practical knowledge of the intervençãos. Strengthening training with revisão sistemáticas and evidence maps to deepen the theoretical foundation and scientific evidence for each specific practice. Documenting detailed case studies of participants with different profiles and responses to intervençãos, to illustrate the qualitativo impact of the project.",

    "abstract": "Since 2005, exactly 20 years ago, the Laboratory of Research in Epidemiology and Social Determination of Health of the Evandro Chagas National Institute of Infectious Diseases (ECNIID)/Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (Fiocruz) has been developing research that seeks to build new practices for promoção da saúde and forms of collaborative knowledge production among the most diverse health professionals, social sciences, education, arts, members and leaders of community groups, developing health actions of collective interest. Among the research developed is the Platform of Knowledge (PK): Promoting health and well-being through community involvement and participation in innovative actions for promoção da saúde and knowledge production, with emphasis on integrative and complementary practices (ICP), which enables active participation of society, also providing subsidies for the social emancipation of those impacted by its actions and contributions to the formulation of public policies. The PK is an initiative that promotes health, care for participants through actions that value and stimulate creativity, experimentation and interdisciplinary, that is, a form of social inclusion, improved self-esteem and reduced inequalities. Since music terapia is one of the 29 ICP institutionalized by the Brazilian Ministry of Health, this practice was used as an innovative proposal to contribute to the social transformation of the community, empowerment and healthcare. This manuscript aims to report the experience of implementing Music Therapy Workshops (MTW) within the scope of the PK and the impact of this collective practice on the health of its participants. We used the main music terapia methods (improvisation, recreation, composition and listening). The guests for the activity are people living with infectious diseases (e.g. HIV/Aids, Chagas disease), chronic diseases (e.g. breast cancer, other neoplasms), health problems (e.g. ansiedade, depressão), and their respective friends/family members also participate. The music terapia practices were developed in groups and in different spaces on the Fiocruz campus. All the MTW were preceded by a discussion group with an invited multidisciplinary team (epidemiologist, infectologist, physiotherapist, nutritionist, psychologist, among others) to carry out the activity according to each topic addressed. The project received financial support from Faperj, the INOVA/FiopromoS/Fiocruz Program and approval from the ECNIID/Fiocruz Research Ethics Committee. The Fiocruz is located in Manguinhos, in the northern part of the city of Rio de Janeiro, a conflict zone with limited and decreasing resources. Together with the communities surrounding Fiocruz, we have experienced that violence is exercised, above all, as a social process, although it is not limited to the health sector. Thus, we must exercise our ethical commitment as saúde pública professionals in developing strategies that contribute to strengthening the community and that enable people to help each other and develop their potential, autonomy, empowerment and improve their qualidade de vida. It is within this context that music terapia fits in, not only within the scope of interdisciplinarity and as one of the ICP, but also as a specialty. The use of music as a power of displacement (which represents how much of the apparent power is transformed into active power), of reinvention, of creativity, can act as a promoção da saúde device, that is, an effective tool to promote social transformation. We held five MTW from September to December 2024, with groups ranging from 15 to 23 participants per MTW. Topics covered (some held during months of health campaigns aimed at raising awareness and preventing diseases): 1) Long Covid from an interdisciplinary perspective; 2) Pink October: promoting care through art; 3) Discussion circle on autism with a technical visit to the Butterfly House at the Museum of Life/Oswaldo Cruz Foundation; 4) Blue November: Integrative Community Therapy; 5) World Aids Day. The guitar was the harmonic instrument used in the MTW, in addition to other percussion instruments (tambourine, afoxé, key chimes, castanets, rattles made from PET bottles with beads, and rattles made from PET bottle caps  providing the sound of rain/sea). The participants, predominantly (90%) women aged between 53 and 82, were able to handle and try out the percussion instruments. Some reports from the participants about the evaluation of the MTW: While you are having fun with the music you are not thinking about other things... music can help bring joy, to get rid of bad thoughts and negativity from your heart... I think that the music, the meetings... the development of the workshops is a great job... (61 years old, male, incomplete elementary education, living with HIV), Its really cool; it builds motivation inside of us... I was in that euphoria... my evaluation is positive, it has to continue [referring to the continuity of the MTW]... (63 years old, male, higher education living with HIV); I heard the doctors guitar [patient with hearing loss due to a previous history of meningitis], but I dont hear the voice... only when they speak really loudly, I hear the rattle, the tambourine... for me it was great! Even though I don't listen to it, I still like it. This is really good for me. I heard that little round thing that I don't know the name of with blue dots [afoxé] (79 years old, female, high school graduate, living with HIV), Wonderful, we wrote the lyrics!!! You have to play it for us whenever you have activities... give us the lyrics so we can practice at home and when we get here [to Fiocruz] we'll already know... to sing along with you... (57 years old, female, high school graduate, living with breast cancer). These are some opinions, the participants also expressed many others, but overall the activity encouraged their engagement and involvement in the music terapia process, motivating them to play, listen, improvise and compose collectively. We expect to continue the PK activities, promoting health and producing knowledge, as the data presented suggest how powerful MTW are for the physical, social, mental, emotional, spiritual and cognitive well-being of people in social vulnerability.",

    "abstract": "The anesthesiologist's role has long ceased to be restricted to the operating room itself. Patient care in the period leading up to and after surgery can have as much or even more impact than the anesthesia itself on the overall resultado of the entire process. By incorporating Ayurvedic principles into patient care in this setting, a unique opportunity is created to make management increasingly individualized, increasing segurança and reducing the rate of complications. There are three distinct moments in which Ayurveda is being incorporated into patient care. First, the patient is prepared for Ayurvedic Pre-Anesthetic care, which is performed on an outpatient basis at our hospital a few weeks before surgery. Patients are referred by the Oncology Service. Therefore, they all have oncological diseases that require surgery. We provide care in several specialties within Oncology, such as Mastology, Urology, Gynecology and Digestive System Surgery, including Proctology. In addition to conventional guidance on medication management and fasting, patients receive a prescription for a diet and individualized routines that focus on optimizing the digestive process and improving the immune system. The goal is for patients to arrive in the best possible physical, mental, emotional and spiritual state for the day of their surgery. Breathing exercises (Pranayama) are also prescribed and guided meditaçãos are offered as non-pharmacological tools for managing preoperative ansiedade. We treat an average of six patients per week. Secondly, the moment of the surgery itself. The Ayurvedic diagnosis of each patient makes it possible to make several predictions regarding the patient's behavior during the intraoperative period. These predictions range from the optimization of anesthetic doses, the need for thermal management, to the more stable or unstable response of the autonomic nervous system to surgical stimuli. Understanding the patient's functioning from an Ayurvedic perspective allows the anesthetist to act in a more individualized manner, including during anesthesia. Thirdly, another very important moment where the insertion of Ayurveda is essential is in the immediate postoperative period, carried out in the post-anesthesia recovery room. After several meetings with the Nursing and Nutrition teams, changes were made to some routines. The temperature control in the recovery room is more rigorous, in order to ensure that the environment is not cold for our patients. All patients receive blankets to help maintain body temperature. Hypothermia in the postoperative period is a frequent complication, and taking this precaution brings many benefits to patients. Early return to diet is another aspect that impacts favorable results. Patients receive a diet according to a flowchart developed and guided by Ayurveda. Initially, they receive small doses of warm water, then an herbal tea, and, before being discharged to the inpatient unit, they receive a soup broth. The method aids the process of rekindling digestive fire, known as agni in Ayurveda, which requires a gradual and systematic approach. This is achieved through a carefully curated diet that supports the process of digestion. Also, the inherent nature of food plays a crucial role in the process, as different foods possess different qualities that can either stimulate or hinder digestive function. Hence special emphasis is laid on selection of the ingredients, selection of the method of preparing and the portion size. Some patients receive a padabhyanga before being discharged from the recovery room. Padabhyanga is an Ayurvedic body terapia that consists of a foot massage with medicated and heated oil. The goal is to promote tissue nutrition, improve blood circulation, stimulate the nervous system, and provide relief from ansiedade, among other things. Initial observations of patients receiving this terapia in the recovery room have shown a decrease in pain scores. One of the biggest challenges faced in implementing Ayurvedic care in a hospital setting is the lack of information among professionals. Several workshops, lectures and meetings were necessary for these new routines to be effectively implemented. The next goal will be to conduct research that can demonstrate the high level of evidence of the benefits that integrative practices through Ayurveda have in reducing postoperative complications, improving patient segurança, reducing hospital stays and, above all, improving the quality of the entire experience for each patient.",

    "abstract": "This practice is being implemented at a large public psychiatric hospital in Saxony, Germany, situated in a rural area but serving a wide regional catchment. The institution operates close to full capacity and treats a broad spectrum of acute psychiatric conditions including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, severe depressão, substance use disorders, psychotic episodes, and dementia-related complications. Its multidisciplinary team includes psychiatrists, psychologists, nursing staff, social workers, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, and kitchen staff, all of whom are actively involved in the integrative process. The introduction of Ayurveda required careful alignment with existing workflows and tratamento standards. Educational sessions familiarized staff with Ayurvedic principles, focusing on nutrition and detoxification therapies as complementary intervençãos. With the rising prevalence of psychiatric disorders, innovative approaches are needed to enhance tratamento resultados while reducing side effects and institutional burden. Integrating Ayurveda into an acute setting addresses somatic symptoms, supports gutbrain communication, and optimizes psychotherapeutic intervençãos. However, psychiatric hospitals often operate at full capacity, making integration complex. Successful implementation requires interdisciplinary collaboration and structured education across all departments. Up to now, full Panchakarma therapies could not be implemented due to ongoing renovation works. Instead, individualized Ayurvedic intervençãos were delivered, tailored to each patients specific complaints. Treatments included Abhyangam with Mahanarayan thailam or Chandanlaxadi oil, Shirodhara with Brahmi tailam, Takra dhara, and nasal therapies (Nasya with Khadbindu tailam, Anu tailam, or Ksheerabala 101, combined with Triphala churna), alongside dietary counselling according to Vata-pacifying principles. Within the first four months, more than 500 inpatients received such individualized therapies, with consistently promising resultados. Patients reported improvements in relaxation, sleep quality, energy levels, and daily structure, while therapists observed greater openness and engagement in psychoterapia sessions. In one illustrative case of chronic tinnitus, the patient underwent 12 sessions over four weeks (Abhyangam with Mahanarayan thailam), head oil applications with Brahmi Tailam (Shiropichu, Thalam), and nasal therapies (Pratimarsha or Marsha Nasya with Ksheerabala 101 and Triphala powder), alongside dietary counselling, resulting in a marked reduction in symptom severity from 8/10 to 2/10. In addition, informal feedback polls from patients, family members, and healthcare professionals were consistently positive. Patients and relatives emphasized that they felt more supported through the holistic approach, while staff highlighted improved interdisciplinary collaboration and enhanced therapeutic engagement. Preliminary findings demonstrate that integrating individualized Ayurvedic therapies into acute psychiatric care is both feasible and beneficial. This approach enhances patient well-being, supports psychoterapia, and offers long-term clinical and economic potential. The guiding principle remains: 'Modern medicine leads, Ayurveda is lived. Key challenges include navigating complex institutional structures, overcoming initial skepticism, and aligning Ayurvedic methods with baseado em evidence psychiatric care. Financial investment for staff training and resources is required but is expected to be offset by long-term savings through reduced medication dependency, shorter hospital stays, and improved resultados.",

    "abstract": "Ayurveda, a 5,000-year-old system of traditional medicine, has long been revered in India for its comprehensive, personalized approach to health and well-being. Rooted in natural and holistic principles, Ayurveda offers a unique perspective on preventive healthcare, and disease management. In recent years, India has made significant strides in systematically integrating Ayurveda into its national saúde pública framework. In India, through supportive policies, institutional infrastructure, and strategic healthcare initiatives, Ayurveda is being positioned strengthens population health. Recognizing the significance of traditional medicine in promoção da saúde and disease prevenção, the Government of India established the Ministry of AYUSH (Ayurveda, Yoga & Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, and Homeopathy) in 2014. This ministry plays a pivotal role in overseeing the development, standardization, education, and regulation of traditional medicine systems across the country. It ensures that Ayurveda and related systems are not only preserved but also integrated meaningfully into the broader healthcare landscape. One of the cornerstone programs promoting Ayurveda within the saúde pública system is the National AYUSH Mission (NAM). Launched with the goal of revitalizing and promoting the AYUSH systems of medicine through cost-effective services and quality control, NAM focuses on improving access to AYUSH services in both urban and rural settings. It facilitates the establishment of AYUSH Health and Wellness Centers (AHWCs), which are integral to Indias Ayushman Bharat initiativea transformative política de saúde that aims to achieve Universal Health Coverage (UHC). AHWCs bring Ayurvedic doctors and community health workers together under one roof to provide comprehensive care that includes disease prevenção, lifestyle counseling, and traditional remedies. These centers offer services ranging from personalized diet and lifestyle plans to fitoterapia prescriptions, yoga sessions, and seasonal detoxification therapies. Not only do they reduce the burden on conventional medical systems, but they also promote culturally acceptable, affordable, and community-based intervençãos. This model has shown promising results in increasing health-seeking behavior and managing chronic conditions in rural populations. In addition to infrastructural expansion, integrative hospital models are being developed where Ayurvedic and allopathic practitioners co-manage patients. These institutionssuch as the All India Institute of Ayurveda (AIIA) in New Delhi and several AIIMS campuses with AYUSH departmentsoffer collaborative care protocols that draw on the strengths of both systems. Integrative tratamento approaches are being explored for conditions like diabetes, arthritis, gastrointestinal disorders, and even post-COVID rehabilitation. Case studies from these institutions demonstrate that blending traditional and modern intervençãos can lead to improved patient resultados, enhanced satisfaction, and reduced healthcare costs. A major area where Ayurveda has shown measurable impact is in the management of non-communicable diseases (NCDs), which include cardiovascular disorders, diabetes, cancer, and respiratory diseases. These diseases, driven largely by lifestyle factors, require a multidimensional management strategy. Ayurveda, with its emphasis on Dinacharya (daily routine), Ritucharya (seasonal routine), and Swasthavritta (principles of health maintenance), provides effective lifestyle intervençãos. Programs like AYUSH Lifestyle Guidelines for Prevention of NCDs promote dietary changes, herbal supplementation, stress management practices, and physical activity, aligning well with the WHOs strategies on NCD control. In the area of maternal and child health, Ayurvedic antenatal care packagesfocused on nutritional support, herbal tonics, and postnatal carehave been introduced in several government health facilities. These intervençãos aim to reduce pregnancy-related complications, improve maternal mental health, and enhance neonatal resultados. Research-backed intervençãos such as Garbh Sanskar (Ayurvedic prenatal education and rituals) are being revisited for their potential role in fostering early childhood development. Ayurvedas mental health intervençãos, especially its use of medhya rasayanas (cognitive-enhancing herbs) and techniques like Abhyanga (therapeutic oil massage), Shirodhara, and meditação practices, are increasingly relevant in managing stress, ansiedade, depressão, and burnout. The government has supported mental wellness initiatives through AYUSH-based atenção plena programs in schools and workplaces. These intervençãos are not only cost-effective but also culturally congruent with Indian communities. The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the institutionalization of Ayurveda within emergency health frameworks. The Ministry of AYUSH released official guidelines on immune-boosting Ayurvedic formulations like Ayush Kwath, Chyawanprash, and Guduchi, which were distributed widely across India. Additionally, integrative management protocols were developed for COVID-positive patients to include Ayurvedic therapies for improving immunity, reducing inflammation, and supporting respiratory function. These initiatives were backed by clinical studies and real-world data, which demonstrated the supportive role of Ayurvedic medicine in pandemic response and post-COVID care. Despite these achievements, several challenges hinder the full-scale integration of Ayurveda into the mainstream health system. Key concerns include the standardization of Ayurvedic formulations, scientific validation through ensaio clínicos, and interdisciplinary collaboration with biomedical sciences. Efforts are ongoing to bridge these gaps. Research institutions like the Central Council for Research in Ayurvedic Sciences (CCRAS) and AYUSH Research Portal are supporting large-scale ensaio clínicos, meta-analyses, and documentation of traditional knowledge. Digitization of Ayurvedic manuscripts and pharmacopoeias is improving access to classical texts. Moreover, initiatives like Ayurveda Bioinformatics and AI-powered diagnostic tools are being developed to modernize Ayurvedic research and diagnostics. Regulatory frameworks are also evolving to ensure quality control, ethical practices, and safe integration into public systems. The global interest in Ayurveda is steadily rising, especially in the context of preventive healthcare and personalized medicine. Many countries are exploring ways to incorporate Ayurveda into their wellness and healthcare offerings. The WHO has acknowledged Indias efforts by establishing the WHO Global Centre for Traditional Medicine in Gujarat, aiming to strengthen global baseado em evidence traditional medicine systems. Indias experience in mainstreaming Ayurveda offers valuable lessons for other nations seeking to diversify their healthcare systems. By emphasizing community-based care, preventive strategies, and holistic principles, Ayurveda serves as a low-cost, scalable, and culturally sensitive model for improving saúde pública resultados. As global interest in Ayurveda grows, India's model serves as a blueprint for integrating traditional medicine into mainstream healthcare. By leveraging Ayurvedas holistic principles, cost-efetividade, and community-centered approach, saúde pública systems worldwide can enhance preventive care and population health resultados. Public Health . This presentation aims to provide insights into Indias Ayurveda-based saúde pública framework, emphasizing policy advancements, implementation strategies, and its potential role in global health systems.",

    "abstract": "Aromaterapia is a complementary and integrative technique that uses essential oils, fatty oils and hydrolates as a terapia. The Evidence Map on Aromaterapia Clinical Effectiveness containing 126 revisão sistemáticas and meta-analyses demonstrates that this is a safe and effective terapia (https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/bireme/viz/aromaterapia-en/evidence-map). Essential oils are volatile substances extracted from botanical species, containing terpenic structures which have an action on the central nervous and biochemical systems. This protocol aims to provide immediate and emergency care to the population displaced from their homes due to the flooding climate disaster. It was developed by the author and applied to the flood that occurred in May 2024 in the southern region of Brazil, affecting more than 90% of the municipalities in the state of Rio Grande do Sul and more than 2 million people, becoming the largest disaster the region has ever suffered. The aromaterapia protocol was developed to be applied in public shelters, with families, elderly aged 75 to 95, and for women and their children. This protocol was awarded first place by the Fondation Gattefossé in the AromaShow Case 2024 Innovative Humanitarian Aromaterapia Protocol Competition (https://www.fondation-gattefosse.org/en/projets/winner-aroma-protocol-for-flood-victims-in-brazil/). OBJECTIVE: To provide emotional support, minimize emotional trauma, reduce symptoms of ansiedade and stress, sadness, fear, and improve sleep and well-being. POPULATION: 350 people was served, included children over 6 years old, teenagers, adults and seniors (CETE Shelter), seniors 75-95 years old (60+ Shelter), women and their children (Violet House Shelter). METHODOLOGY: First step: inhalation of 1 drop of sweet orange Citrus sinensis essential oil, on absorbent material (cotton or inverted adhesive-bandage), frequency 1x per week, duration 3 weeks (on average). Second step: inhalation of 1 drop of blend essential oil (1:1, sweet orange Citrus sinensis and tea tree Melaleuca alternifolia) on absorbent material (cotton or inverted adhesive-bandage), frequency 1x per week, duration 3 weeks (on average). EVALUATION: The following items were evaluated: emotional improvement, reduction of symptoms of ansiedade and stress, decrease in sadness and fear, improving sleep and promoting relaxation, improved well-being. The assessment was carried out by the aromatherapist and the multidisciplinary team at the shelter (responsible for integrative practices at the shelter, psychologist, physiotherapist, nursing assistant, nursing technician, social worker). It was asked the question to the sheltere: \"How are you feeling after using aromaterapia\". Other assessment tools and protocols were not used due to the emergency care situation in this calamity. RESULTS: 98 to 99% of responses were positive regarding the improvement of the items evaluated. RESEARCH BIAS: these were the identified biases: (a) the sheltered person begins to accept the situation, (b) the prospect of returning to the home, (c) positive effect of access to doctors, medicines and food, (d) getting new clean clothes and blankets from donations, (e) receiving other integrative practices. CONCLUSION: This aromaterapia protocol achieved the proposed objective: to provide emotional support, minimize emotional trauma, reduce symptoms of ansiedade and stress, sadness, fear, and improve sleep and well-being. Aromaterapia is a viable and effective tool to be used in cases of catastrophes, calamities and extreme suffering (collective in large populations or individual). This protocol can be used in saúde pública centers in cities and regions. The recommendation is that this aromaterapia protocol will be disseminated institutionally to national public policies and international non-profit organizations (NGOs) in order to make this service available to the population in cases of environmental disasters and tragedies, especially floods.",

    "abstract": "This is an relato de experiência about a music terapia intervenção carried out with adolescents in conflict with the law, who were serving restrictive socio-educational measures and depriving them of their liberty, admitted to a Socio-Educational Assistance Center (SEAC), linked to the National Institute for the Eradication of School and Social Deprivation (NIESSD) and the State Secretariat for Justice and Social Reintegration of Santa Catarina, Brazil. The intervenção aimed to promote personal well-being and psycho-spiritual comfort to the students. Music terapia is the use of music to help achieve a specific change in the behavior, feelings or physiology of human beings.1 Regarding the content of the intervenção, some songs were pre-selected by the researchers and others were suggested by the students themselves. It is worth noting that the songs had varied structures, comprising different styles, rhythms and tones, with moderate tempos and little variability; most were in major mode, simple harmony and consonance. The musical presentation method was live, at a pleasant volume. Regarding the intervenção materials, male and female human voices, digital piano and acoustic guitar were used. In some meetings, the students tried to play percussion instruments such as cajon or half-moon tambourine. The intervenção strategies were listening to and recreating music, organized in monthly interactive group sessions lasting an average of 60 minutes over a period of one year. It is important to emphasize that the first author (nurse, musician and researcher in the area of music terapia as a nursing intervenção) and the second author (musician) are responsible for the intervenção. The fidelity of the tratamento, which ensures control conditions, was attributed to the evaluation of seven professionals who monitored the socio-educators.2 Adolescents serving socio-educational measures that deprive and restrict freedom are subject to problems such as ansiedade, social isolation and spiritual suffering, given that the period of internment can vary from six months to three years, with assessments every six months. In this context, nursing can use Integrative and Complementary Health Practices (ICHP). In fact, within the scope of the Nursing Care Systematization (NCS), music terapia is suggested for nursing diagnoses such as ansiedade, social isolation and spiritual suffering, with the aim of achieving nursing resultados such as personal well-being and psycho-spiritual comfort.3 By valuing the human rights of socio-educational students, in an attempt to contribute to their overcoming process, promoting citizenship and achieving assisted freedom, the project converges with the Socio-therapeutic intervenção axis of the Intereducational Program for the comprehensive management of the resocialization and social reintegration of adolescents in conflict with the law4, which is fundamental for their success in the process of change and in the construction of a life project. During the project, ten music terapia sessions were held, involving 12 to 18 socio-educational students per session, all male, aged between 15 and 20. Gradually, the atmosphere of joy and relaxation took over the environment, noticeable through the exchange of glances, smiles and body posture, which became less rigid with each song; through the tapping of hands or clapping, following the rhythm of the music. It is important to record the interaction of the socio-educational students in the process of choosing the songs, respecting the collective appreciation, always choosing songs that the majority knew, liked and could sing along with the musicians. They chose songs that were peculiar to this phase of the life cycle, such as country songs, which talk about love or disappointments in love, or songs that portray their social reality (most of which were unknown to the musicians); songs that aroused emotions linked to past memories, when we could see eyes filled with tears; or gospel music, when they could express their spirituality and hope for better days. At the end of the sessions, they would thank us for being with them and for the music. They also asked for the sessions to be held weekly. According to the assessment of the seven SEAC professionals, music terapia can contribute to the process of achieving supervised freedom; reduce ansiedade; favor social interaction and integration; promote mental health and well-being; awaken self-esteem and self-knowledge; promote psycho-spiritual comfort; stimulate creativity, communication and expressiveness; favor overcoming the difficulties faced; increase the chances of supervised freedom being achieved and avoid reoccurrences; promote social inclusion, guarantee equal opportunities and reduce inequalities in results; expand access to art and culture; contribute to positive change in the behavior of socio-educational inmates. For one of the professionals, music makes them more sensitive and happy. This opens a path for positive thoughts and makes them better people, as it relieves stress and calms their minds. The professionals also believe that the project contributed to their own well-being. The results presented suggest that music terapia promoted personal well-being and psycho-spiritual comfort to socio-educators and professionals; they can stimulate other initiatives; and contribute to the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) such as Health and well-being, Reduction of inequalities and Art, Culture and Communication, which aim to ensure a healthy life and promote mental health and well-being for all; promote social inclusion, guarantee equal opportunities and reduce inequalities in results; and ensure plurality and cultural freedom, democratization of art and inclusive communication for all.5",

    "abstract": "RAVA is a semi-standardized method of ear acupuntura and was developed in the Department of Naturopathy and Integrative Medicine at the Hospital Essen-Mitte by Dr. Thomas Rampp and Jonas Vasmer. RAVA is delegable and can be used by doctors and nurses. We have more than 5 years clinical experience using the RAVA-method (the majority of our patients have dor crônica disorders) and a study to our new ear-acupuntura method will start at the end of this year/ in the beginning of 2026. We have been training doctors throughout Germany for over 2 years now and the feedback is tremendously positive. RAVA is now used in emergency rooms, pain clinics, private outpatient clinics and even in gynecology and pediatrics departments. Most ear-acupuntura protocols consist of 5 standardized acupuntura-points or have no system at all (just a rough order of selecting a few ear-acupuntura points). Therefore the RAVA semi-standardized method is new. It is to the patients and to the doctors satisfaction. The patients benefit from the ear-acupuntura tratamento and for in ear-acupuntura experienced doctors/ nurses it can be learned within one day. This is the advantage of combining 3 RAVA base-points with 2 individually selected ear-acupuntura points each ear. The causal principle for the regulation and vitalization of the three RAVA base-points is based on the theory of the Triple Burner (San Jiao). In fact, there are three theoretical concepts: The Triple Burner is either understood as one of the six hollow organs (6 Fu), as the Road of Primordial-Qi (Yuan Qi) or thirdly, as one of the three parts of the body. In all of the three theories, the Triple Burner ensures the correct direction of movement of all types of Qi in all parts of the body (hence also of blood and other body fluids) and thus supports all other organs in their functions (prevents stagnation). This means that if we treat the Triple Burner, we support every functional process of the body and that is why we are seeing a regulating effect. In addition, the Triple Burner positively influences the production, transport and conversion of Qi and therefore has a vitalizing effect. The RAVA-method combines three defined RAVA base-points of the ear with two individually selected ear acupuntura points. In the RAVA-protocol the Triple Burner is embodied/represented by the three base-points Shen Men, Sympathetic II and Liver. In terms of their location and function, the three RAVA base-points derived from the NADA-method and were correlated with the Triple Burner system. Shen Men (Fire, Heart) reflects the Upper, Sympathetic II (Earth, Spleen/Stomach) the Middle and Liver (Wood, Liver) the Lower Burner. Moreover, according to theory, all three base-points have an overarching effect on the body and mind. By combining three base-points as causal terapia for body and mind and optionally two additional customizable ear acupuntura points, both chronic and acute symptoms can be treated at the same time. RAVA is the combination of western physio-neurology of the ear with eastern TCM theory to create a new effective ear-acupuntura tratamento. In conclusion the RAVA-method is (didactically and clinically) a valuable addition to previously known ear acupuntura protocols.",

    "abstract": "The Program of Integrative and Complementary Health Practices at the Federal University of Viçosa (PPICS-UFV), established in 2021, develops actions focused on promoting mental health and qualidade de vida for both the university community and the local population. The project team is composed of three faculty members from the nursing program, one technical-administrative staff member, five masters students from the Graduate Program in Health Sciences, and 15 undergraduate nursing students. For the present report, the actions carried out by the project between July 2024 and February 2025 will be highlighted. PPICS-UFV provided periodic services in three areas: (I) Cupping terapia, for undergraduate students; (II) Guided meditação and breathwork, for undergraduate and graduate students, as well as university staff; (III) Auriculoterapia, offered to: individuals in a Prisoner Reintegration Association (APAC); patients and staff at a Psychosocial Care Center (CAPS) and a Psychosocial Care Center for Alcohol and Drugs (CAPS AD); and to the acadêmico community (undergraduate and graduate students). In addition, the project participated in health and mental promoção da saúde events organized by the university and by local health services. Furthermore, the program maintains an online social media platform that shares scientific posts about Integrative and Complementary Health Practices. During the period reported, 45 individuals received 85 cupping terapia sessions, and 60 individuals participated in 45 guided meditação and breathwork sessions. Regarding auriculoterapia, the number of people and sessions varied depending on the institution: at APAC, 404 sessions were conducted for 29 individuals; at CAPS, 15 individuals received 166 sessions; at CAPS AD, six individuals received 45 sessions; and among the university community, 344 individuals participated in 934 sessions. The program also took part in university events such as Ligas Day, UFV na Trilha, 1st National Health Week, 94th Farmers Week, Public Servant Week of Viçosa, Caring for the Caregivers: A Morning of Relaxation, University Showcase, and the Public Servants Day Celebration, offering auriculoterapia and cupping terapia sessions. On the programs social media, 70 posts were published addressing scientific evidence. In addition, 27 acadêmico works produced by project members were presented at scientific events, two of which received awards. Moreover, two master's theses were defended, and three undergraduate final papers were completed. Two scientific articles were published in indexed journals classified as Qualis A4 and A2 by The Brazilian Federal Agency for Support and Evaluation of Graduate Education (CAPES). Six informational brochures (on Auriculoterapia, Cupping Therapy, Medicinal Plants, Aromaterapia, Foot Baths, and Breathwork, including information on what each practice is and its benefits) were also produced. Committed to promoting mental health and qualidade de vida, PPICS continues to expand its activities in support of the university and local communities.

    "abstract": "Circular dance (CD) is one of the 29 Integrative and Complementary Health Practices (ICHP), established by ordinance of the Brazilian Ministry of Health. It is an expressive, traditional and contemporary body practice, through circle dancing. It has its origins in different cultures, which favors learning and harmonious connection between participants. In the dynamics, assistance is mutual, promoting human integration and equality, aiming at physical, mental, emotional and social well-being. The focus is not on technique, but rather on the feeling of unity, group and community. Impacts on physical and mental health are perceived, as dance works on balance and mobility. The psychological benefits point to the contribution of improving self-esteem and reducing symptoms of depressão, ansiedade and stress. This work aims to report the theoretical and practical experience of CD experienced by medical students, led by the Academic League of Integrative Medicine (ALIM) of a private Higher Education Institution (HEI). The League's goals include, for example, extending services to society arising from teaching and research activities and providing acadêmicos with a space to develop autonomy and leadership in the construction of scientific knowledge. The workshop took place in the IES auditorium on March 24, 2025. We began with a PowerPoint presentation (theoretical content) led by a trained and expert professor (focuser/facilitator), moderated by a university professor, which lasted approximately 40 minutes. The theoretical part addressed ICHP in general, as therapeutic resources that aim to prevent disease and restore health. The theoretical part covered ICHP in general, as therapeutic resources that seek to prevent diseases and restore health. The importance of listening attentively, developing a therapeutic bond and integrating human beings with the environment and society was emphasized. The definition of CD, its symbology, history, dancers positions and movements, among others, were discussed. The practical activity was then carried out, in which all 16 students participated and were able to experience two CDs. In the next 50 minutes we started the practical part of the DC, with the focalizer guided and explained the origin and meaning of each song and the respective choreography, and everyone positioned themselves in a circle. Then, everyone held hands and sat (CD in Chair) and danced Lode Alla Montagna, a song of Italian origin, whose intention was to awaken awareness of the journey through life, the need for help at certain times and the reconstruction with love and gratitude. Then, everyone stood, holding hands in a circle and danced Hear the Joy, a traditional Hebrew song, whose intention was hear the joy, celebrate the joy, share your joy of being here at this moment, all of us together. The daily acadêmico life of medical students is very demanding, so it is essential that they learn about and develop practices that help reduce ansiedade and maintain a balanced mental health. With adequate emotional support, it is possible to promote health, reducing exhaustion and even burnout syndrome. By acquiring knowledge of self-care strategies and practices, students expand the possibilities of providing comprehensive and humanized care to their patients. The integration of the management of a conventional model with other rationalities facilitates the understanding of the different systems or ways of understanding, diagnosing and treating diseases within the field of medicine. The concept of medical rationalities recognizes that there are several ways of thinking about and practicing medicine, each with its own internal logic, beliefs, techniques and forms of care. It is worth mentioning that the ICHP, and in this case CD, aimed to include a therapeutic approach to integrate and complement the health of students, pointing out another path towards the logic of humanized care. After the dynamic we developed the following guiding question for the feedback of the activity: How did you feel participating in the CD practice All 16 students who participated in the dynamic assessment responded by describing the impact of the experience. We selected some reports: This experience also helped me increase my body awareness and strengthen my mind-body connection...; The practical class was incredible, it was inspiring. I felt lighter and more connected to myself. I loved the way that the technique was not so much demanded, but rather the inclusion of everyone. I hope to take everything I learned today into my life and do my best to share it with other people, so that they feel exactly what I felt in this class. The CD made me feel close to my classmates. Today I was a little irritated and I felt very happy and excited, I even forgot about the stress...; I really enjoyed the class, and especially the practical part...; I think there was a nice exchange of energies. Medical school demands a lot of time from our day and a lot from our mental and physical health; I brought back a childhood memory. Today I felt happy and how this interaction away from social media makes a difference; Such practices always help to bring lightness to our daily lives. In addition to opening our eyes and horizons so that we can already introduce our future routine of medical practice. According to the reports presented, we believe that CD contributed significantly to awakening respect for others, affection for oneself and others, in addition to promoting improved self-esteem. Because it is performed in a group and with hands held, DC favored the circulation of positive energy, which, as pointed out in some testimonies, can even be perceived as therapeutic. The results suggest that CD promoted the students' physical, mental, emotional, and social well-being. Furthermore, reports indicate benefits in improving self-esteem and reducing symptoms of ansiedade and stress. To enhance these benefits, we recommend the active involvement of teachers and professionals in the field, integrating these practices into the acadêmico context on an ongoing basis. We also suggest creating shared spaces for exchanging experiences, allowing students to express their perceptions and enhance the positive impact of Circle Dance and other practices that stimulate body movement, relaxation and personal interaction.",

Auriculoterapia is a therapeutic technique that promotes psychophysical regulation of the individual through stimulation of specific points located on the auricular pavilion. Evidence has reinforced its high patient acceptability, segurança, and efetividade, with positive effects on physical, psychological, and mental disorders. It can be used both as a preventive and therapeutic intervenção. Aiming to increase the number of trained professionals in auriculoterapia within atenção primária and to expand the populations access to this therapeutic resource, the Municipal Auriculoterapia Protocol was published in November 2022. In January 2023, a partnership was established with the Federal University of Santa Catarina (UFSC) to provide professional training in auriculoterapia, designating the municipality as a Practical Training Hub. The practical stage was supported by the Center for Mindfulness and Integrative Therapies (CEMIT) of the University of São Paulo at Ribeirão Preto College of Nursing (EERP-USP), which provided logistical and structural support. The implementation of auriculoterapia in Ribeirão Pretos SUS revealed several challenges, such as the need for continuous and ongoing professional education, regular acquisition of materials, and adjustments in care routines to ensure the effective incorporation of the practice by municipal professionals. Service adherence required support from local management, team engagement, intersectoral articulation within SMS-RP, and dissemination of the practice to the community. Ribeirão Preto was designated as a hub for the practical activities of two editions of the training course, held in May 2023 and June 2024. The target audience included Primary Health Care professionals, multidisciplinary teams in basic care, home care, street clinics, and Psychosocial Care Centers (CAPS). A total of 463 spots were offered, with 245 reserved for professionals from Ribeirão Preto and the remaining 218 open to professionals from other regions of Brazil. All spots allocated to the municipality were filled; however, 165 professionals (67%) completed all training stages and were certified. After two years of training, the number of professionals qualified in auriculoterapia in the municipal network increased by 546%, from 37 in 2022 to 202 in 2024. The number of health units offering auriculoterapia grew by 700%, from 6 in 2022 to 42 in 2024, covering 66.7% of the 63 eligible units. The number of auriculoterapia procedures registered in the municipal information system increased by 430%, from 2,189 in 2022 to 9,417 in 2024. The practice began to be offered both individually and in group settings, benefiting people with diabetes, dor crônica and temporomandibular joint dysfunction (TMJ), smoking cessation needs, ansiedade, depressão, as well as healthcare professionals within the services. The experience in Ribeirão Preto demonstrates viable pathways for expanding PICS within the municipal SUS, emphasizing professional training, regulation of practice, intersectoral articulation, and financing. This initiative enabled expanded access to auriculoterapia in a safe manner, based on national guidelines and aligned with the 2022 Municipal Protocol, which served as a key facilitator of the process. Continuing education has proven to be a powerful tool for team engagement and for enhancing the quality of auriculoterapia care. Identified challenges include the need to sustain training actions, ensure the continuous acquisition of supplies, and improve monitoring and evaluation strategies, thereby promoting comprehensive, humanized, and interprofessional care within the territory.",

    "abstract": "Background: As integrative medicine advances, there is increasing recognition that effective promoção da saúde requires individuals to take an active role in shaping their own well-being. Consciousness-Based Integrative Preventive Medicine (CBIPM) offers a novel, evidence-informed framework that synthesizes insights from consciousness science, energy and information theory, quantum physics, neuroplasticity, and Antonovskys salutogenic model. This approach aims to cultivate multidimensional wellness by activating inner healing resources and fostering coherence, meaning, and self-directed health behaviors. Objective: To evaluate the feasibility, participant experience, and perceived impact of a pilot community-based educational program grounded in CBIPM principles, designed to enhance health literacy and promote holistic well-being. A seven-week online course was delivered to 63 adult participants, consisting of 14 sessions combining theoretical instruction and experiential learning. The curriculum integrated consciousness-based and salutogenic principles across the following core topics: 1. Introduction to CBIPM: Holism, wellness, self-regulation, and self-healing 2. Energy, Information, and Health: Bridging ancient wisdom and modern science 3. Quantum Physics, Consciousness, and Health: Exploring energyawareness interconnections 4. Redefining Health and Illness through a Consciousness-Based Lens 5. Life Events, Trauma, and Illness: Meaning-making and integration 6. The Nature of Healing in a Consciousness-Based Framework 7. Salutogenesis and Neuroplastic Reprogramming for Optimal Well-being Experiential components included guided meditação, breathwork, energy healing techniques(e.g., Emotional Freedom Techniques, gut, heart, brain coherence training), and practice in small group. Results: Quantitative course evaluations indicated high participant satisfaction: content value (mean score 4.7/5), professionalism (4.9/5), and overall satisfaction (4.7/5). Qualitative feedback revealed increased emotional clarity, spiritual growth, energy awareness, and empowerment. Several participants described the program as transformational, citing enhanced self-regulation, expanded perspective, and deeper connection to self and others. Notably, over one-third expressed interest in continuing group sessions to further integrate the material and practices. This pilot implementation of CBIPM demonstrates strong feasibility, high participant engagement, and positive short-term resultados in terms of self-perceived transformation across emotional, mental, physical, and spiritual domains. By promoting a proactive, consciousness-based model of preventive medicine, CBIPM shifts the focus from disease avoidance to the cultivation of vitality, coherence, and meaning. These findings suggest that CBIPM may serve as a scalable, community-centered approach to saúde pública education. Further research is warranted to evaluate long-term effects, optimize delivery methods, and assess applicability across diverse populations and cultural contexts. References: Almachavan, S. A.

    "abstract": "Cancer patients and survivors often face emotional, existential, and social challenges beyond physical illness. Emerging evidence suggests that group-based intervençãos can foster compassion, spiritual healing, and resilience, offering benefits beyond symptom reduction. Holistic practices such as group meditação, qi gong, and energy-based therapies may align participants within a shared biofield or collective consciousness, facilitating access to a more adaptive sense of identity and meaning. Resonance and neural entrainment between the biofield and the nervous system are proposed mechanisms underlying observed psychological and physiological improvements. Biofield therapies have been shown to reduce pain, ansiedade, fatigue, and distress in cancer patients, while enhancing emotional resilience, relaxation, and spiritual well-being. Considering this growing body of knowledge on the therapeutic potential of group energy work, we developed a consciousness-based group energy healing program (20202025) to support cancer patients and their communities through integrative, mind-body-spirit care. Each group formed around a patient with advanced cancerglioblastoma, osteosarcoma, metastatic breast cancer, B-cell lymphoma, or pancreatic cancerand included up to 13 participants, such as family, friends, and volunteers. The intervenção combined weekly Zoom-based sessions with twice-weekly synchronized distance healing, co-facilitated by a medical doctor trained in clinical EFT and energy healing, and an experienced energy healer. Unlike traditional support groups that primarily emphasize emotional expression and verbal processing, this consciousness-based group healing model is grounded in the premise that healing may emerge through the collective alignment of consciousness, intentionality, and subtle energy fields. Rather than focusing solely on narrative sharing, the group experience is designed to cultivate a resonant energetic environment that supports transformation on emotional, physical, and spiritual levels. Each session began with mindbody practicessuch as conscious breathing, Emotional Freedom Techniques (EFT) tapping, and Qigongto promote somatic awareness, relaxation, and energetic balance. These were followed by participant-led creative contributions, including poetry readings, group singing, and the sharing of meaningful visual media. These elements served to foster emotional connection, cultivate positive affect, and create a sense of shared humanity and joy within the group. The central component of each session involved the co-creation of healing intentions that were individually tailored to the specific needs of the patient for whom the group was formed. These intentions were then woven into guided meditaçãos, offered both during the live online sessions and through remote group practices conducted synchronously twice a week. This multidimensional process allowed participants to engage with the field of healing not only through presence and empathy, but through a sustained, intentional energetic connection. The combination of group coherence, spiritual focus, and sustained attention to healing intentions provided a unique therapeutic container that appeared to support deep inner shifts among both patients and participants. Participants reported reduced ansiedade, enhanced emotional resilience, and improved self-regulation of tratamento side effects, alongside greater trust in their holistic healing process. Many noted heightened sensitivity to the shared energy field and a deeper sense of bodymindspirit integration. Clinical improvements were observed in several patients, including three documented remissions. Notably, the glioblastoma centered group has continued for over five yearsremarkable given the average survival of 1218 months. Increased creativity, emotional openness, and interpersonal connection among all the participants were also frequently reported. This model demonstrates the potential of group-based intentional energy healing to complement conventional oncology care. It offers a reproducible, consciousness-based framework for integrative practitioners, with promising implications for addressing psychoneuroimmunological dynamics and the biofield in chronic and oncologic conditions.

    "abstract": "The Municipal Week of Integrative and Complementary Health Practices (PICS) was established in Ribeirão Preto-SP through Law No. 14.745/2022, aiming to promote, value, and disseminate integrative and therapeutic practices. This initiative aligns with the National Policy on Integrative and Complementary Practices (PNPIC), published on 3 May 2006, and is celebrated annually in May, encouraging participation from civil society organisations and specialised institutions through lectures, workshops, and therapeutic experiences. In 2023 and 2024, the PICS Coordination I of the Municipal Health Department of Ribeirão Preto, in partnership with civil society sectors and local institutions, organised a month-long programme in May focused on workers health. The activities included therapeutic intervençãos, workshops, experiential sessions, and dialogue circles, offering support and self-care spaces for healthcare professionals. Studies have shown that PICS not only support improvements in the physical and mental health of professionals but also play a crucial role in reducing stress, increasing resilience, and improving qualidade de vida in the workplace. This experience reaffirms the municipal administration's commitment to integrative public policies and to valuing SUS workers, pointing towards the strengthening of comprehensive healthcare within the local territory. Attention to workers health is a continuous and increasingly essential demand, particularly in light of prolonged exposure to stress, workload, and emotional impact, which compromise individual well-being and qualidade de vida. Over the course of these two years, the activities held during the month of May reached a total of 795 participants, with 1,477 PICS procedures performed. The services offered included Reiki and energy healing, meditação and atenção plena, aromaterapia, flower essence terapia, discussion circles on myths and truths in fitoterapia, massage, reflexology, foot soaks, systemic acupuntura, auriculoterapia, biodanza, circle dancing, yoga, tai chi chuan, and systemic constellations. In addition to activities held in health units, the schedule also included external theoretical-practical events such as a roundtable on The Integration of PICS in Public Health, the launch of the Reiki Protocol of SMS-RP, a live broadcast on Salutogenesis: reclaiming your human health potential, a webinar on the Implementation of PICS in Different Municipalities in São Paulo State, and a photo exhibition titled Gardens of Health, showcasing green spaces within the citys health units. Noteworthy is the articulation with partner institutions such as the Centre for Mindfulness and Integrative Therapies of EERP-USP, LAEPIC  Academic League of PICS of EERP-USP, and the Reikilibra USP Project  EERP-USP. There was also broad participation from civil society, with over 40 hours of voluntary services, therapeutic kits, and workshops donated. Care actions directed at healthcare professionals make this population more visible and promote their integration and health, even through punctual intervençãos. The experience of the 2nd Municipal Week of PICS demonstrated that providing such activities in the workplace can be a powerful strategy for promoting health and well-being, fostering integration among healthcare workers, civil society, and educational institutions, while disseminação these practices, broadening access, and increasing healthcare professionals knowledge about PICS. It also offers new perspectives on healthcare. Moreover, incorporating these practices into the work environment strengthens the sense of self-care and encourages a healthier, more collaborative organisational culture.",

    "abstract": "Most people dont realize their brain is dysregulated. Its not a diagnosisits not even abnormal. Its human. We all experience brainwave dysregulation at some point: during stress, after trauma, through burnout, illness, or simply living in an overstimulated, always-on world. The difference is this: some brains return to balance. Others get stuckand when dysregulation becomes persistent, it silently disrupts everything else. Thats the missing layer in most integrative models. Many systems address trauma, sleep, nutrition, and nervous system support. But supporting the nervous system often means using indirect inputslike breathwork, manual therapies, or supplementsthat dont measure or directly shift the dysregulated brainwaves. This model uses qEEG brain mapping and neurofeedback to bring those patterns into focusthen shift them. Its not terapia. Its not pharmaceutical. And it doesnt require a diagnosis. Its a measurable feedback system that helps the brain learn to better regulate. In this model, we start with a quantitative EEG (qEEG)a brain map showing real-time patterns in brainwave activity. These arent guesses or symptom checklists. Were looking directly at how the brain functions. The maps often match what clients already know in their bodies: I feel anxious but cant shut it off, Im tired but wired, Ive done all the work and still feel stuck. When the brain map confirms what theyve been feeling, they move from self-blame to directionand thats when the shift begins. With data in hand, we create a custom training protocol that helps brainwaves shift out of stuck patterns and learn to better regulate. Most wellness systems do meaningful worksupporting nutrition, sleep, trauma recovery, and lifestyle. But many miss the deeper, electrical patterns running silently beneath it all. Brainwave dysregulationtoo much fast activity, too little alpha, hemispheric imbalancegoes unmeasured in most care models. As a result, clients do everything right and still feel stuck. They try new diets, see new therapists, commit to healing practicesand still dont shift. Not because theyre doing something wrong, but because their brain is still running a survival pattern that none of those tools can touch. Without looking at brainwaves, the real issue remains hidden. When we dont see it, we cant help improve negative symptoms. The process is gentle and non-invasive. Clients sit quietly while their brain receives feedbackthrough visual or audio cuesbased on its own activity in real time. No performance. No overthinking. Just feedback, session by session, rhythm by rhythm. Because the feedback is tied to what we saw in the brain map, the brain learns to shift in exactly the way it needs to. This model is implemented in multiple settings: In-Person Intensives: High-frequency, 5-day retreats begin and end with qEEG maps. Visible shifts in brainwave function often correlate with improved sleep, mood, clarity, and emotional regulation. Virtual @Home Programs: Clients train remotely using portable systems with structured case management, check-ins, and progress tracking. This model increases access while maintaining data integrity. Functional Wellness & Coaching Practices: Practitioners integrate neurofeedback to move clients past blocks talk-based or lifestyle intervençãos cant fully address. Across all formats, the results are consistent: when brainwave regulation improves, other strategies begin to work better. We've seen clients whove tried everything finally experience meaningful shiftsphysiologically and cognitivelyonce they began better regulating their brainwaves. One remote user client, a 15-year-old male with absence seizures and attention challenges, experienced a 57% improvement in brain function with major reductions in impulsivity and a drop in his metabolic score from 36 to 1indicating better neurological and systemic regulation. During an intensive experience (neurofeedback combined with Shamanic Energy Work in 4 day period), a 53-year-old woman with a history of ansiedade, depressão, and chronic fatigue showed a 38% shift in brain function, with improved attention, emotional regulation, and a drop in her metabolic score from 272 to 37. Another participant, a 60-year-old woman dealing with inhibition and impulsivity, completed an intensive and showed a 40% improvement in her qEEG with notable shifts in mood regulation, attention, and overall metabolic health. These results are measurable, meaningful, and often correlate with improved emotional flexibility, better sleep, and increased clarity. Not because neurofeedback solved everything, but because it shifted the internal state that was blocking progress everywhere else. This model solves four core problems in integrative and wellness care: 1. Dysregulation Goes Unseen When brainwave activity isnt measured, providers often miss one of the most foundational contributors to lack of progress. qEEG makes the invisible visible and offers a measurable training path forward. 2. Clients Are Doing the WorkBut Still Struggling When the brain is dysregulated, even the best strategies dont work. It helps the brain shift into a more flexible, stable, and integrated stateso clients can access what they already know. 3. Generic Care Misses Whats Actually Needed Most intervençãos are built around symptomsnot brain function. Each protocol is based on a persons brain map and adapts as they progress. 4. Not Enough Providers Know How to Use It Even as awareness grows, access remains limited. Too few practitioners are trained, equipped, and confident in how to measure and support brainwave regulation. It offers a scalable, non-clinical way to bring brain-based support into real-world carewithout requiring a diagnosis or prescription. This model supports TCIM values: self-regulation over suppression, adaptability across modalities, and empowerment through real-time feedback. It doesnt compete with other approaches. It stabilizes the system so everything else can work better. When we finally measure whats going on in the brain, we stop guessing and we start shifting.",

    "abstract": "The project \"Knowledge Platform (KP): Promoting health and well-being through community involvement and participation in innovative promoção da saúde and knowledge production actions, with an emphasis on Integrative and Complementary Health Practices (ICHP)\". This is an initiative developed by the Research Laboratory in Epidemiology and Social Determinants of Health of the Evandro Chagas National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID) at Fiocruz, in Rio de Janeiro. The objective of this work was to describe the implementation of the \"1st Reiki Level I Training Course for Community Health Promoters.\" The aim was to generate knowledge on promoção da saúde strategies and, simultaneously, document the experiences and impact of the active participation of citizens in situations of social vulnerability. The motivation for the design and implementation of this course lies in the commitment to Well-Being and Health, directly aligned with the 3rd Sustainable Development Goal of the United Nations 2030 Agenda. It is believed that the promotion of comprehensive health is a fundamental pillar for social development. A qualitativo, descriptive, and exploratory methodology was used to present the Reiki technique, a practice recognized by the Brazilian Ministry of Health since 2017, which aims to achieve energetic balance. A Reiki master led the activities, and 13 community members and leaders, designated as Community Health Promoters (CHPs), attended the course. This group consisted of people living with HIV, Chagas disease, breast cancer, other neoplasms, ansiedade, and depressão. In addition to the CHPs, two healthcare professionals also participated in the course, enriching the exchange of experiences. The diversity of participants contributed significantly to the richness of the discussions and experiences provided by the course. The course was designed in response to the significant social and health challenges faced by the communities where the participants live. The intervenção takes place in a context of social vulnerability, which justifies its relevance and impact. The CHPs who participated in the course live in communities frequently marked by territorial conflicts and high rates of violence. This environment of constant insecurity has a profound impact on individuals' health and well-being, contributing to chronic stress, ansiedade, and other mental health conditions. Continuous exposure to risky situations compromises qualidade de vida and the ability to self-care, making it essential to develop strategies that promote resilience and well-being amidst adversity. The population served by the project faces a considerable burden of psychological distress. Anxiety and stress disorders are prevalent, affecting the ability to cope with illness, tratamento adherence, and overall qualidade de vida. A contemporary and relevant problem is the spread of fake news, including ICHP, such as Reiki. This misinformation can generate skepticism and resistance, preventing citizens from seeking or benefiting from complementary therapeutic approaches that could improve their health and well-being. The successful implementation of the course was ensured by the institutional support of Faperj and the INOVA/FiopromoS/Fiocruz Program, which provided the necessary resources and adequate infrastructure for the implementation of the proposed activities. Therefore, the course flowed satisfactorily, without incidents or difficulties in its implementation. The course was held in May 2024, lasting a total of 16 hours, in the classroom of the NIID's Vice-Director of Education. The training followed Mikao Usui's traditional Reiki system, considered the decoder of the practice, covering the fundamentals of Reiki, self-application techniques, application positions, and the internalization of the five Reiki principles: \"Just for today, do not be angry, do not worry, be grateful, work honestly, and be kind to all beings.\" One of the key indicators of this intervenção's success was the full adherence of the 15 participants, who accepted and completed the Reiki Level I training. This demonstrates the group's high level of interest and engagement with the course. The 100% completion rate attests to the perceived relevance of the content and methodology applied, as well as the commitment of the CHPs to their personal development and promoção da saúde within their networks. Self-application and Reiki exchange practices were conducted among the participants, allowing everyone to experience the Reiki energy and develop their practical skills. At the end of the training, we received reports that verbalized the positive impact of the experience. The narratives converged on feelings of \"balance,\" \"harmony,\" and \"energetic strengthening\" promoted by Reiki. One of the most important lessons learned from this experience is the power of practical experience and direct community engagement in promoting health. The results of this course suggest the continuation and expansion of similar initiatives. The experience reinforces the potential of Reiki not only as a self-care tool but also as a catalyst for community empowerment and the promotion of a culture of well-being. To maximize the impact of Reiki training, it is recommended that this model be replicated in other community groups. Involving community groups in disseminação the technique helps expand Reiki's reach and visibility, as well as promote knowledge. This dissemination, based on real experiences and the testimonies of beneficiaries, is a powerful way to produce and build new knowledge. It is emphasized that reporting this experience can contribute to the improvement of public policies and contribute to the effective integration of Reiki into atenção primária. The potential of newly trained Reiki practitioners as a tool to strengthen mutual aid networks among members of the PSC communities is recognized.",

    "abstract": "This study explores how atenção plena micro-practices serve as catalysts for self-perception, a prerequisite for developing self-awareness. The intervenção was structured as an eight-week program with short atenção plena exercises, such as conscious breathing and mindful eating, applied in diverse work environments in São Paulo: a fast-food restaurant, an elementary school, a luxury hotel, and a law firm. Open-ended questions were applied to qualitativoly assess the reported resultados. Results indicate increased self-awareness, stress reduction, and improved workplace interactions. Findings suggest that integrating short, accessible atenção plena practices into daily routines can foster personal and professional well-being. The \"Projeto Respira\" introduced brief atenção plena exercises into the routines of employees and educators across four settings. Conducted in the city of São Paulo, state of São Paulo, Brazil, the sessions were held weekly, lasting 30 minutes, and combined micro-practice with a socio-emotional reflection. The program was intentionally designed to fit into busy schedules, addressing the common challenge of lack of time for self-care and emotional development. Participants practiced conscious breathing, mindful eating, and body awareness, aiming to enhance self-perception and emotional balance.  High stress and emotional reactivity.  Difficulty in maintaining focus and self-awareness due to time constraints.  Desafios in emotional regulation and interpersonal relationships.  The prevalence of \"autopilot mode\" in daily activities.  Well-being improvement: Participants reported an average 44% increase in well-being after the sessions.  Emotional recognition: An average 44% improvement in the ability to identify emotions through micro-practices.  Social interaction: An average 23% increase in patience and tolerance toward oneself and others.  Awareness of surroundings: An average 50% increase in environmental awareness and present-moment experience.  Adaptability: Practices need customization for different professional settings.  Engagement: Initial resistance was observed, requiring strong facilitation.  Sustainability: Long-term adherence remains a challenge.  Further Research: More studies are needed to quantify the long-term effects.",

    "abstract": "The National Policy on Integrative and Complementary Health Practices (PNPIC) advocates the incorporation of these practices into the healthcare network, highlighting Primary Health Care (PHC) as a strategic axis for their implementation (BRASIL, 2006). This level of care, due to its attributes of longitudinality, comprehensiveness, care coordination, and low technological density (STARFIELD, 2002), combined with its emphasis on promoção da saúde and disease prevenção, offers a fertile ground for Integrative and Complementary Practices (PICS). In 2022, with the implementation of a new multidisciplinary team at Walter Elias Primary Health Care Unit, located in the Northern Zone of São Paulo, the cross-cutting incorporation of PICS into care plans began. This initiative aligned with the concept of the Expanded Clinical Approach (CAMPOS, 2003), aiming to broaden the therapeutic scope beyond the traditional biomedical model, address the complexity of health needs in a complementary manner, and strengthen users' autonomy through supported self-care practices (WHO, 2013). Currently, the Walter Elias PHC Unit has a multidisciplinary team (e-multi) composed of a physical therapist, psychologist, nutritionist, and social worker, in addition to the medical, nursing, and dental teams. Among the collective care offerings, PICS stand out in group activities such as: \"Introduction to Homeopathy\", led by a homeopathic doctor; \"Integrative Health Workshop\" (featuring Integrative Community Therapy - ICT for adults and older adults, as well as Circle Dances, led by the physical therapist, the psychologist and the nutritionist); Tai Chi Pai Lin, led by a nurse; Meditation led by the nutritionist and the physical therapist; Body Practices and Self-Massage led by the physical therapist; ICT Circles for adolescents, and ICT Circles for children, both led by the psychologist. In addition to group practices, the unit also offers individual PICS modalities, such as Homeopathy consultations, by the homeopathic doctor, and Auriculoterapia, by the physical therapist, the psychologist and the nutritionist. Access to these practices varies: while groups like Introduction to Homeopathy, the Integrative Health Workshop, Tai Chi Pai Lin, Meditation, and Body Practices and Self-Massage are open to all users in the territory, access to other ICT Circles (for adolescents and children) and individual practices occurs through prior assessment and referral by a health professional, based on the users specific health needs at the time. Even for open practices, the health team may refer users to one or more specific PICS based on their health conditions and needs, so these can be integrated into their therapeutic and care plans in PHC. Thus, the access pathway combines spontaneous demand with qualified referral, ensuring that PICS are integrated into care plans in a personalized manner, in line with the principles of comprehensive care (MATTOS, 2004). The implementation of PICS at Walter Elias PHC Unit focused on the main health needs identified in the territory, particularly those sensitive to atenção primária. With a predominance of elderly residents, the main care demands include chronic conditions such as hypertension and diabetes, dor crônica, mobility preservation, fall prevenção, physical inactivity, mental distress, encouragement of social participation, and reduction of social isolation. In child and adolescent care, issues related to mental suffering, depressão, ansiedade, and socialization also stand out. Following the inclusion of PICS in Primary Health Care plans, two main resultados emerged at the Walter Elias PHC Unit. In terms of user profiles, there was significant engagement from the elderly population, with a noticeable improvement in socialization, reduction of isolation, and the strengthening of social bonds that extended beyond the health unit into the broader community. Involvement in PICS also enhanced user engagement with their self-care and other health initiatives offered by the unit. In contrast, for children and adolescents, participation was limited, mainly due to their dependency on the availability of parents or guardians, who are often engaged in work routines during service hours. Finally, the integration of PICS into the care routines of the unit has also led to a gradual cultural shift within the serviceboth among users, who have started to see the PHC unit as a place for health creation, rather than just a source of consultations, referrals, and prescriptions, and among professionals, who are increasingly recognizing the value of non-biomedical therapeutic approaches for both patient care and their own self-care. This experience, ultimately, represents a successful example of the practical implementation of the PNPIC principles, by articulating traditional and scientific knowledge (FILICE, 2018), and demonstrates how Primary Health Care can operationalize this public policy in everyday practiceespecially in urban settings. This experience revealed important structural and cultural challenges in fully implementing PICS within atenção primária. The care culture of the PHC unit still reflects a predominantly biomedical model. Without structured institutional support, the process relied heavily on the leadership of the multidisciplinary team, whose work is grounded in interdisciplinarity and the Expanded Clinical Approach. However, limited team communication, few opportunities for matrix support, and the absence of regular interprofessional meetings made it difficult to coordinate care flows and shared therapeutic plans. Most PICS training was acquired through individual effort and self-funded. The psychologist, physical therapist, and homeopathic doctor obtained various certifications independently, while the municipal health department supported training in Meditation, Tai Chi, and Auriculoterapia for the nutritionist, nurse, and physical therapist. Initial user expectations also posed a barrier, as many were unfamiliar with PICS and expected conventional approaches. Overcoming this required ongoing health education and dialogue. There were also infrastructure limitations, especially for group activities. As a response, the team partnered with community spaces outside the PHC unit to carry out some practices. While the initiative and engagement of the multidisciplinary team were crucial for the initial implementation of PICS, their long-term consolidation and expansion across the health network require greater institutional support. Advancing in this direction involves investing in ongoing professional education on integrative practices, strengthening internal communication and care coordination among health workers, and supporting interprofessional collaboration. These efforts are essential to ensure the effective and sustainable incorporation of PICS into routine care, as outlined in the PNPIC, and to promote a broader transformation of healthcare within Brazil's Unified Health System.",

    "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Anthroposophic External Therapies (TEAn) are integrative practices that aim to promote health and well-being through external therapeutic stimuli, such as compresses, baths, massages and glide techniques. This project aimed to implement the service and train professionals (staff and volunteers) to apply TEAn in health units in the Federal District, integrating them into the Unified Health System (SUS). The initiative sought to expand the population's access to complementary practices, strengthen the training of health professionals and promote the humanization of care. METHODS The project was developed along four main axes: 1. Training: Conducting a theoretical-practical-experiential course, with a workload of 80 (eighty) hours, taught by guest professors specialized in Anthroposophy (TEAn). 2. Implementation: Introduction of TEAn was implemented in 11 (eleven) health units, with the acquisition of materials, audiovisual recording of the practices for future dissemination and publication of 04 (four) textbooks. The initial strategy focused on the application of TEAn to the staff of the units involved, aiming at engagement and sustainability. 3. Dissemination: Publication of educational materials (books and videos), making it possible to replicate in other units and regions. 4. Research: a qualitativo research was designed, which is underway, in the implemented units to evaluate the efetividade of the practices and the perception of professionals and users. The project was a partnership between Fiocruz-Brasília, the State Department of Health of the Federal District (SES/DF) and the Chamber of Deputies, for the research we also had the partnership of the Brazilian Academic Consortium of Integrative Practices (CABSIN). DISCUSSION The implementation of TEANs in the SUS-DF proved to be viable and beneficial, both for users and for health professionals. The partnership with institutions such as Fiocruz-Brasília, the Chamber of Deputies and CABSIN was fundamental to the success of the project. The ongoing qualitativo research will provide valuable insights for the expansion and improvement of practices. The availability of thematic videos and books will contribute to the dissemination of knowledge and the sustainability of the project. The project rescued the possibility of a natural and integrative tratamento for human beings. It was observed that the number of visits by users to the different specialties reduced the demand for medical appointments, reducing the burden on the Unified Health System, and also reducing the travel of these patients. The experiential part of the training, for both staff and users, provoked commitment from the participants, which was initially low, at times. The participation of volunteers in the training course allowed the involvement of the community, producing autonomy, involving them and increasing this partnership, giving sustainability to the project and practice. We are well aware of the difficulty management has in maintaining a new service. Volunteers were also given a three-month financial aid to strengthen the implementation of the practice and the maintenance of the service in the units involved. With the formation of the support network - composed of all employees and volunteers, teachers and coordinators of the Integrative Practice in Health: Anthroposophy Applied to Health of the SES-DF - it was possible to strengthen implementation actions, find solutions in the work of the TEAn, involve the community and unit staff, materials, difficulties with patients, issues with local or regional management. This was done through the exchange of experiences, preparation of documents, calling of meetings, etc. Greater humanization of care was provided, improving the user-server relationship, whether in individual care or in the implementation of awareness-raising and instruction workshops for TEAn. There was an increase in user awareness and responsibility in their health-disease process, resulting in greater participation in self-care and commitment to the entire tratamento. Last but not least, there was a recovery and empowerment of traditional practices known to the population, now systematized and based on Anthroposophy. Thought not lived is thought dead Rudolf Steiner RESULTS 1. Training: 43 (forty-three) professionals were certified by Fiocruz, demonstrating high satisfaction with the course and increased theoretical and practical knowledge, confirmed by self-assessment and evaluation of the course by participants. 2. Implementation: The TEAn were successfully integrated into 11 (eleven) health units, at the three levels of care, two of which were in rural areas, with reports of improved user well-being and greater engagement by professionals. 3. Dissemination: The four published books are being used as reference material, and the videos of the practices are in the editing phase to be made available to employees (all practices) and users (the simplest practices to perform), and also for ongoing training. 4. Qualitative Research: Preliminary results indicate that the TEAn are well accepted by users and professionals, standing out as an effective and low-cost complementary approach. CONCLUSIONS The project showed that the training and implementation of TEAn in the SUS-DF are effective strategies to promote the integration of complementary practices in the saúde pública system, with the potential to improve the quality of care and reduce costs. Continuity and replication in other regions can strengthen the provision of integrative care, improve the qualidade de vida of the population and strengthen public policies for integrative health. The implementation of integrative therapies in public services faces multidimensional challenges: management turnover compromises the continuity of projects, while lack of knowledge and prejudice about TCIM lead to the deprioritization of these practices. Managers often reallocate qualified professionals to other areas, interrupting consolidated services and depriving the population of humanized therapies that have been proven to improve health and self-care. This institutional instability, combined with the lack of appreciation for integrative practices, results in wasted resources already invested in training and weakens the comprehensiveness of care. Overcoming these obstacles requires strategies for continuous awareness-raising among managers, systematic documentation of results, and the creation of institutional mechanisms that protect these initiatives from political discontinuity.",

    "abstract": "This project is a partnership between the Nursing Department of UFPR through NEPES (Teaching, Research and Extension Center in Health) and LIPVISA (Laboratory of Innovation and Promotion in Health Surveillance), and the Massage Therapy Board of IFPR. The services are provided in the Nursing sector of UFPR, and the information is publicized through social media, email and posters spread throughout the university. It is implemented by students in the final period of the technical and technology courses in Massage Therapy at IFPR. Abstract The Brazilian Network of Health-Promoting Universities (REBRAUPS) began in 2018 and is formed by public and private higher education institutions, including the Federal University of Paraná. REBRAUPS is part of a global movement called Health-Promoting Universities (UPS) that began in the late 20th century, resulting mainly from the developments of the Health Promotion Charters. This movement encourages actions for a healthy acadêmico environment, considering the different lifestyles and health needs of individuals who live in the same space. In the context of a UPS, institutions are expected to commit to the qualidade de vida and well-being of the community, acting through training, education and promoção da saúde services, in a pleasant physical and social environment, where skills and behaviors focused on self-care are encouraged. The National Policy for Integrative and Complementary Health Practices (PNPIC), in force since 2006, enables multidisciplinary services focused on promoção da saúde in healthcare settings and also advocates the importance of research and training of new professionals in this area, encouraging partnerships with educational institutions. Massage terapia is a practice with a strong preventive component, helping to manage conditions such as muscle tension, dor crônica, and stress-related disorders. The integration of integrative practices into saúde pública reflects a paradigmatic shift in the approach to care, moving away from focusing exclusively on curing diseases to adopting a more preventive and comprehensive model. This paper reports preliminary data from an intervenção with massage terapia carried out on the community that passes through the spaces of a Health Promoting University. This is a project in partnership between two federal public institutions, the Instituto Federal do Paraná (IFPR) and the Universidade Federal do Paraná (UFPR), in the city of Curitiba. In the proposal, students of the technical and technology courses in Massage Therapy at IFPR practice some of the massage techniques included in the course curriculum, such as Quick-massage (chair massage), Shiatsu, Manual Lymphatic Drainage and Foot Reflexology, in the community linked to UFPR. The services began in 2024, during the second acadêmico semester. The services, carried out in the Nursing and Occupational Therapy sector of UFPR, took place in the evening, from 7:15 pm to 10 pm, twice a week, over the course of 5 months. As a preliminaryl results, in terms of quantitative aspects, a total of 298 services were recorded, with 190 people served and 119 are part of UFPR and others 71 are from the external community. This project points out that the assignment of integrative practices in the context of UPS can strengthen the assumptions of promoção da saúde policies in the country, as well as the objectives of UPS, increasing the number of services if we consider the number of people involved in acadêmico spaces, thus expanding the network of services to the population in a space that educates, raises awareness and, above all, promotes health. Aspects considered relevant in this short period of the project were the participants' positive reception of the techniques, the significant number of sessions, and the opportunity to promote health in practice while mobilizing the professional development of massage terapia students. Furthermore, the compatibility between principles of the REBRAUPS and the National Policy for Integrative and Complementary Practices (PNPIC) indicate that initiatives like this one is a good practice to mobilize in the Brazilian promoção da saúde context. Massage terapia as an integrative practice for promoção da saúde in the acadêmico context The inclusion of integrative practices in the acadêmico context is encouraged, considering the convergence with health policies and promoção da saúde practices observed in the UPS guidelines.",

    "abstract": "This experience was implemented in a peripheral urban territory marked by high social vulnerability, historical inequalities, collective psychological suffering and fragmentation of community ties. In this context, the SIID ERA civilizational model operates as a horizon for rebuilding health  not merely as the absence of disease, but as a dynamic state of vitality, consciousness and human dignity. Adopting an ecology of knowledge, the initiative integrates both biomedical approaches and ancestral/energetic wisdoms, enabling regenerative integrative care experiences. Health is approached as a broad process encompassing physical, emotional, mental, social, spiritual and planetary dimensions. The practice articulates local atenção primária networks (Brazilian SUS), popular knowledge, vital-energy-based therapies (therapeutic touch, pranic healing), conscious nutrition, accessible biohacking and active listening methodologies, aimed at restoring trust in ones own body and human relationships. Through the SIID ERA approach, each action is a civilizational act: rescuing autonomy, nurturing dignity, sowing care networks and expanding consciousness  not simply treating symptoms, but reprogramming realities. The initiative contributes to the SDGs related to health and wellbeing, gender equality, reduction of inequalities and resilient communities. 2) What is SIID ERA SIID ERA is an applied civilizational model and innovation institute (Scientific and Innovation Institute for Development  Eco Regions of Abundance). It acts simultaneously as a methodology and an organization. Nature: Think tank + open-innovation lab focused on regenerative futures and deep-health. Structure: Organized as a social innovation network connecting universities (e.g., PUC-Campinas, USP), governments, communities, private investors and ancestral knowledge holders. Financing: Works through blended finance (public grants, philanthropic capital, ESG-innovation investments, community crowdfunding, cooperative revenues). Methodology: Integrates health, ecology, education, spirituality and technology to produce micro-ecosystems of abundance, especially in vulnerable territories. 3) Context / Geographic & Socio-demographic Situation Country: Brazil City/Region: Western urban periphery of São Paulo Territory characteristics: High population density, low HDI, poverty concentration, domestic violence reports, weak community networks, food insecurity and limited access to care. Predominance of women caregivers and Black/Brown populations historically excluded from mainstream health infrastructures. 4) Background of the Experience Implementation started: 2021 (postpandemic) Human resources involved: ~20 people (1 coordinator SIID ERA, 4 integrative therapists, 2 nurses, 1 popular educator, 1 nutritionist, 1 psychologist, 10 community-based volunteers) Number of people impacted: ~1,000 individuals Integrative practices used: therapeutic touch, pranic healing, auriculoterapia, mindful nutrition, phytoterapia, group breathing, body-listening circles, biohacking with hydrogen water and solar energy. Professionals involved: nurses, psychologists, traditional healers, educators, therapists, SUS community health agents. Initial focus: not a single clinical case, but a broader community-based intervenção. 5) Note on Case vs. Experience Report Although one patient was described to illustrate context, this is not a clinical relato de caso, but rather an experience-based community report with collective results. The abstract should therefore focus on overall impacts, rather than on an individual case.",

    "abstract": "Clinical Auriculoterapia (CA) is a tratamento that uses the stimulation of points and areas of the ear to provoke reflex effects on the Central Nervous System (Nogier, 2021). This method is applicable to a wide range of conditions, including various organic dysfunctions, pain, insomnia, and psycho-emotional issues, and has demonstrated efetividade in supporting the tratamento of addictions (Nogier, 2014). This report aims to evaluate changes in the physical and emotional conditions of visitors at Health events, to identify the prevalent complaints among these individuals and promote the efetividade of CA as a valuable therapeutic resource. This relato de experiência refers to the Clinical Auriculoterapia Workshops conducted at three events in 2024: the USP 60+ Booth during the Expo-Longevidade; the Healthy Aging Symposium at USP 60+; and the International Congress of Gerontology at EACH-USP. Participants were visitors to these events. The CA workshops featured an average of nine auriculotherapists working for nine hours daily over five days. Visitors voluntarily approached the CA workshop booth, where they were offered a CA session. Initially, they responded to the question: \"If you could change something about your health today, what would it be\" If they mentioned pain, the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) was applied before and after terapia, ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (intense pain). The ears were examined and treated based on the complaints presented, utilizing electrostimulation and needle insertion in the external ear at the identified altered points. These tratamentos followed the recommendations of Resolutions 466/2012 and 510/2016 of the National Health Council. The sample included 644 participants, consisting of 581 women and 93 men, with an average age of 64 years. The most common prevalent complaint was musculoskeletal pain, reported by 430 participants. Additionally, there were complaints of ansiedade/depressive symptoms (135), insomnia (50), and other complaints in smaller numbers. Among the 430 participants who reported pain, 426 experienced immediate improvement, with a predominant difference of five points in the VAS when comparing initial pain levels to final evaluations. Furthermore, 114 participants reported zero pain, indicating a complete absence of pain as a final effect of the terapia. Notably, some participants contacted us in person or by phone to share improvements in undesirable signs and symptoms in the physical and emotional aspects that were treated during the sessions. CA has proven effective in reducing chronic musculoskeletal pain, emerging as an efficient therapeutic option for promoting health and recovery (Morais et al., 2020; Nassif, 2020). The reviewed articles demonstrated that auriculoterapia is an effective method for reducing chronic musculoskeletal pain and is well accepted by patients. This evidence is highly relevant for healthcare, considering that auriculoterapia represents an easy-to-apply therapeutic resource with relatively few side effects, supporting promoção da saúde and recovery (Morais et al., 2020). A systematic literature review by Nassif (2020) found a positive effect on pain relief in 69% of the analyzed studies, with a 100% success rate when applied with laser. Regarding psycho-emotional effects, Correa et al. (2020), reported that auriculoterapia proved effective in most studies across various clinical situations involving stress, ansiedade, and depressão, including conditions such as multiple sclerosis, substance abuse, dementia, headache associated with traumatic brain injury, insomnia, and pain. In addition to its efetividade, CA has shown to be minimally invasive, safe, low-cost, and requires little time for application. Notably, the use of CA in patients with depressive symptoms resulted in significant improvements, bringing benefits in health, social, and economic aspects, as found by Crespo (2018) in a study involving 206 patients treated with CA for ansiedade-depressive syndrome. Participants also reported that auriculoterapia contributed to improved sleep quality, corroborating findings by Cordeiro, Kuba, and Turrini (2023), who studied sleep quality in 80 nursing professionals experiencing stress and observed that auriculoterapia significantly contributed to the improvement of insomnia. The results demonstrated immediate pain relief in the majority of participants, along with improvements in various signs and symptoms that were affecting their overall well-being. These findings underscore the significance of integrating Clinica Auriculoterapia into both public and the private healthcare settings, highlighting its potential as a valuable therapeutic option for enhancing patient care and promoting health.",

    "abstract": "Clinical Auriculoterapia (CA) is a diagnostic and tratamento method developed in the early 1950s by French physician Dr. Paul Nogier (Nogier, 2021). This tratamento is grounded in the theory of somatotopic representation, which posits that the external ear reflects the body's regions as a whole. When this tratamento is applied to specifically identified areas, the corresponding body part responds with a homeostatic reaction (Nihashi et al., 2001; Nogier, 2021), resulting from the modulation of the Central Nervous System (Rabischong and Terral, 2014). Both the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Brazilian Ministry of Health recognize Auriculoterapia as an integrative practice due to its efetividade in treating multiple disorders, including dor crônica, gastrointestinal issues, emotional disturbances, and enhancing athletic performance. Despite being recognized and utilized in the Brazilian's Unified Health System (SUS) and by some professional councils, training in this field still lacks comprehensive federal regulation to establish minimum standards and ensure quality and consistency in the training of auriculotherapists nationwide. In response to the existing gap in undestanding the foundations of auriculoterapia and with the goal of enhancing the quality of auriculotherapist training, ensuring their professional recognition, and providing legal security for both practitioners and patients, the Escola Raphaël Nogier de Auriculoterapia Clínica (ERNAC) was established in Brazil in 2014 in partnership with the Groupe Lyonnais dÉtudes Médicales (GLEM). From 2014 to 2020, training was conducted through in-person courses, during which 88 auriculotherapists were trained. Since 2020, the complete course, comprising over 380 hours, has been offered in a Distance Learning (EAD) format. During this period, an exclusive course focused on musculoskeletal pain, known as \"DMSK\", was created, training 153 students. Beginning in 2023, a technical cooperation partnership was established with Focus University, transforming the course into a lato sensu postgraduate program recognized by the Brazilian's Ministry of Education (MEC), now offered in EAD format, with a total workload of 500 hours. All classes are conducted remotely with simultaneous recordings, facilitating students' access for content review and accommodating any absences. The curriculum encompasses a variety of subjects that cover both the theoretical and clinical aspects of Auriculoterapia, including opportunities for supervised in-person practice conducted by monitors trained by ERNAC, currently available in seven major cities across Brazil. Additionally, the course includes close monitoring through synchronous mentoring conducted via videoconferencing platforms, both by the representative in Latin America and by Dr. Raphaël Nogier, WHO advisor on Auriculoterapia. Students also have access to the most comprehensive and up-to-date written materials on Auriculoterapia, consisting of brochures (BookWorks) delivered weakly, totaling 591 pages. The course is exclusively designed for health professionals seeking to enhance their skills and knowledge in this complementary integrative practice. This report aims to share eleven years of teaching experience in Clinical Auriculoterapia in Brazil, following the principles of Dr. Paul Nogier and to raise awareness among health professionals about the importance of proper training to use this practice competently and respectfully with the individuals they assist. ERNAC, in the distance learning format, has trained 684 Auriculotherapists in Brazil, including 161 physiotherapists, 143 nurses, 76 pharmacists, 56 physicians, 26 dentists, 27 psychologists, 18 physical education professionals, seven occupational therapists, and two gerontologists, among many other health professionals, totaling 25 different specialties. Most of these professionals reside in the state of São Paulo, but there are auriculotherapists distributed throughout Brazil and abroad, a fact resulting from the ease of the course being offered almost entirely remotely, with the possibility of monthly in-person practical supervision. ERNAC also has international students residing in Portugal, Spain, Peru, El Salvador, Argentina, Paraguay, and Japan. To date, 50 auriculotherapists trained by ERNAC have had the opportunity to travel to Lyon, France, to complete an advanced course at GLEM. It is noteworthy that, despite the lack of a specific number of individuals claiming to be auriculotherapists in Brazil, some professional councils in the health field, such as the Federal Council of Physioterapia and Occupational Therapy (COFFITO) and the Federal Nursing Council (COFEN), recognize Auriculoterapia as a practice that can be utilized by their professionals, provided that proper training is demonstrated. However, they are often unaware of the difference between Clinical Auriculoterapia (CA) and auricular acupuntura derived from Traditional Chinese Medicine. The commitment of ERNAC to the competence of these auriculotherapists is immense, which is why there is a continuous effort in the education and learning of these professionals through the Community of Essential Professionals, a sector where only the 684 professionals trained at ERNAC are accepted for case discussions and the development of strategies for Auriculoterapia in various dysfunctions and/or pathologies. Furthermore, in November 2025, 28 auriculotherapists will have the opportunity to enhance their professional competence in the birthplace of Auriculoterapia, at GLEM, where theoretical and practical improvement classes will be taught, especially on Vascular Sign and Nogier Frequencies, by the world reference in Auriculoterapia, Dr. Raphaël Nogier, with simultaneous translation provided by his representative in Portuguese and Spanish, Dr. Larissa Bachir. The data presented highlight the critical importance of quality education in Clinical Auriculoterapia (CA) and the need for health professionals to be aware of the value of postgraduate studies that teach authentic Auriculoterapia. It is essential for the Ministry of Education (MEC), along with the Federal and State Councils of Education and the resolutions of health professional councils, to take responsibility for CA and establish clear criteria for the competent practice of these professionals. By doing so, we can ensure that practitioners are well-equipped to provide effective and respectful care, ultimately benefiting the individuals they serve.",

    "abstract": "Raphael Vasconcelos Balboni is a Brazilian integrative health practitioner, educator, and researcher dedicated to holistic healing through the fusion of voice, nature, and body movement. He is the creator of Dynamic BioSinging, a unique therapeutic approach that integrates vocal expression, music terapia, and body awareness, inspired by both ancestral traditions and contemporary health practices. His work is deeply rooted in rural and peri-urban communities of Brazil, particularly in regions where access to traditional health services is limited. In these settings, Raphael combines Singterapia, Agroecological principles, and music as powerful tools for collective healing and community resilience. These environments provide fertile ground for reconnecting individuals with their natural rhythms, cultural roots, and inner vitality. Raphaels approach emphasizes not only personal well-being but also social and environmental regeneration. He facilitates workshops, healing retreats, and community-based projects that engage participants in self-discovery, land-based practices, and sound exploration. Over the years, he has represented his work at several international integrative health conferences across Latin America and Europe, contributing to global dialogues on the role of art, ecology, and indigenous wisdom in healthcare. His vision continues to inspire a broader understanding of healing as a dynamic, creative, and grounded process. The Dynamic BioSinging approach addresses a range of interconnected challenges in health and well-being, particularly in underserved and rural communities: - Emotional and psychological distress: Many individuals face ansiedade, depressão, trauma, and emotional blockages due to social isolation, economic hardship, and lack of access to mental health services. Dynamic BioSinging offers a non-verbal, embodied form of expression and healing through sound, movement, and vocal liberation. - Disconnection from nature and community: Modern lifestyles often lead to a sense of alienation from the natural world and collective cultural identity. Through the integration of Agroecological practices and group vocal experiences, the method helps restore this vital connection. - Limited access to integrative health practices: In many parts of Brazil and Latin America, especially in rural or marginalized areas, alternative health modalities remain inaccessible. This practice brings low-cost, community-based intervençãos directly to those who need them most. - Suppression of personal expression: Cultural and social norms can discourage open emotional expression and creativity. Dynamic BioSinging empowers individuals to reclaim their voiceliterally and metaphoricallyfostering greater self-awareness and self-worth. - Lack of interdisciplinary health models: The method proposes a new model that bridges voice terapia, music, somatic awareness, ecological health, and community resilience, offering a more complete and sustainable approach to well-being. The implementation of Dynamic BioSinging in various contexts across Brazil and other parts of Latin America has generated meaningful and observable resultados, both on individual and collective levels: - Emotional Release and Regulation: Participants frequently report a significant reduction in symptoms of ansiedade, emotional tension, and internalized stress. The vocal practices provide a safe and expressive outlet for emotions, promoting inner balance. - Improved Self-Confidence and Communication: The vocal and body-centered dynamics help individuals to strengthen their self-expression, leading to increased confidence, improved interpersonal communication, and greater public speaking abilities. - Enhanced Community Bonding: Group practices foster cooperation, empathy, and collective awareness, helping rebuild trust and cohesion within fragmented or marginalized communities. - Greater Connection with Nature: Integration with agroecological environments enhances participants' relationship with the land, food, and cycles of life. Many report a deepened sense of belonging and ecological consciousness. - Cultural Revitalization: By valuing ancestral knowledge, traditional songs, and local cultural expressions, Dynamic BioSinging helps preserve and renew community identities and strengthens intergenerational dialogue. - Low-cost, Replicable Model: The practice has shown potential as a scalable and accessible health intervenção that can be adapted to various cultural, economic, and educational contexts. Recomendações and Desafios While Dynamic BioSinging has shown positive resultados in diverse contexts, its continued development and integration into broader health systems present both valuable insights and important challenges: Recomendações - Incorporate into saúde pública and educational programs: Governments and institutions should consider integrating voice-based and nature-connected therapies into mental health, education, and community resilience strategies. - Create interdisciplinary training opportunities: To ensure safe and effective application, it is recommended to develop training programs for facilitators that combine knowledge in music terapia, somatics, agroecology, and integrative health. - Promote research and documentation: Further scientific studies and case documentation are encouraged to validate and disseminate the resultados of Dynamic BioSinging, supporting its recognition as a legitimate integrative health practice. - Support community-led adaptations: Empowering local communities to adapt and lead *Dynamic BioSinging* sessions ensures cultural relevance, sustainability, and long-term engagement. Desafios - Lack of institutional support: Despite its potential, integrative and artistic practices often face marginalization within formal healthcare systems. - Limited funding and resources: Financial support for grassroots health initiatives remains a barrier, particularly in low-income or rural areas. - Need for more facilitators: The expansion of the practice requires trained professionals who are both skilled and culturally sensitive, which calls for investment in education and mentorship. - Balancing tradition and innovation: Respecting ancestral knowledge while adapting to contemporary needs is a continuous challenge that requires careful listening and ethical engagement.",

    "abstract": "Fibromyalgia is a chronic and increasingly prevalent rheumatic syndrome worldwide, primarily affecting women. It is characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain, with specific tender points, significantly impacting patients' qualidade de vida. Common symptoms include sleep disturbances, intense pain, mood changes, and reduced mobility. Although its etiology is considered idiopathic, studies suggest that oxidative stress is one of the most likely contributing factors, leading to alterations in the immune system, neuroprotection mechanisms, and pain perception pathways. In this context, ozone terapia has emerged as an innovative and effective complementary tratamento, acting in an integrated manner within the body. This terapia promotes oxygen regulation in the organism for several days, aiding in the healing of infectious processes, reduction of oxidative stress, and alleviation of pain. It also stimulates the immune, circulatory, and neuroendocrine systems, contributing significantly to improved qualidade de vida for patients. Studies show that individuals diagnosed with fibromyalgia seek medical services more frequently than the general population, especially for pain management. It is estimated that this condition accounts for approximately 15% of rheumatology consultations worldwide. Thus, in light of the structural limitations of the Brazilian Unified Health System (SUS), it is increasingly necessary to invest in integrative and complementary practices that offer therapeutic efficacy, resolution of symptoms, and enhance the well-being and qualidade de vida of patients. GENERAL OBJECTIVE: To offer ozone terapia to women diagnosed with fibromyalgia in the municipality of Toritama. SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES: To implement ozone terapia as a pioneering practice in the State of Pernambuco; To reduce pain levels and pain perception; To improve the qualidade de vida of women diagnosed with fibromyalgia. METHODOLOGY: The initiative was developed at the Medical Specialties Unit in the city of Toritama, Pernambuco, targeting women aged 20 to 65 years, with a sample size of N=112 patients. Participants were actively recruited by Community Health Agents, covering both rural and urban areas. The inclusion criterion was the presentation of a medical report confirming the fibromyalgia diagnosis, within the specified age range. The experience posed no risk to the involved population. The intervenção was carried out once a week, in a comfortable environment, where ozone terapia was applied both systemically and locally, according to each patient's individual needs and clinical profile. The tratamentos were reassessed after 10 sessions, in patients who completed the terapia without interruption. Additionally, all patients were monitored every 5 sessions by a rheumatologist from the Municipal Outpatient Clinic. For evaluation purposes, several questionnaires were applied: 1. A socio-cultural questionnaire to identify the profile of each patient; 2. The FIQR (Revised Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire), aimed at assessing the various domains and overall impact of fibromyalgia; 3. The VAS  Visual Analogue Scale, used to measure the intensity of pain and to monitor the patients progress; 4. The SF-36 (Short Form Health Survey 36), a key tool used to evaluate qualidade de vida and widely employed in public policy assessment studies. RESULTS This practice is innovative, withToritama being the first city in Brazil to implement ozone terapia for the tratamento of fibromyalgia in women, and it is easily replicable by municipalities of any population size. The patients underwent 10 sessions of ozone terapia, with systemic applications via rectal insufflation and/or minor autohemoterapia, in addition to localized applications according to the pain site. Based on the sociocultural questionnaire, the typical patient profile was female, with an average age of 40, low household income, no personal income, and chronic use of prescription medication for more than one year. Regarding the FIQR (Revised Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire)which assesses the global impact of fibromyalgia on a patient's lifean initial median score of N=91 was recorded, indicating a very high level of impairment. After the terapia sessions, the reassessment showed a median score of N=39, reflecting a 64% improvement in the patients' qualidade de vida. For the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), the initial average pain score was 8.9, which decreased to 4.2 after tratamentoa low level of pain for patients with this condition. Finally, in the SF-36 (Short Form Health Survey 36), an average 71% improvement in overall qualidade de vida was observed among all evaluated women. The incorporation of ozone terapia into the municipal health system has proven to be an innovative tratamento with significant impact, making this municipality the first in the country to adopt this PICS (Integrative and Complementary Health Practices) modality for women with fibromyalgia. The initiative achieved strong adherence from the selected population and yielded exceptional results in improving qualidade de vida and promoting integrated care for women living with this condition. The experience can be applied across all levels of healthcare, whether in primary or specialized care, and is adaptable to small, medium, or large municipalities, given its low cost to the Municipal Health Fund and its requirement for only a structured care flow and qualified professionals. Thus, with reduced pain levels, improved qualidade de vida, and enhanced functionality in daily living activities, the initiative has restored joy and biopsychosocial well-being to its participantsfulfilling the primary goals of the project: to provide integrated care and create a significant and positive impact on the lives of women with fibromyalgia.",

    "abstract": "Arterial hypertension is one of the leading risk factors for cardiovascular diseases and is closely associated with chronic stress, sedentary behavior, and inadequate lifestyle habits. Non-pharmacological intervençãos are increasingly being incorporated into healthcare practices, particularly those aimed at stress management. Forest bathing (Shinrin-yoku) is a therapeutic practice involving conscious and prolonged exposure to natural environments, promoting mental and cardiovascular health. This relato de caso describes the application of a forest bathing intervenção within the Brazilian Unified Health System (SUS) in the municipality of São Bento do Sul, Santa Catarina, in 2024. This relato de caso describes the application of a forest bathing intervenção within the Brazilian Unified Health System (SUS) in the municipality of São Bento do Sul, Santa Catarina, in 2024. The objective was to assess changes in blood pressure (BP) levels among adult participants undergoing the practice. The relato de experiência included18 participants aged between 20 and 72 years, with 16 women and 2 men, all registered in the SUS. The intervenção took place at the Ecoparque do SAMAE, along an 800-meter trail through a dense rainforest. The activities comprised respiratory exercises, stretching, mindful walking, and focused listening to natural sounds. BP measurements were taken 10 minutes before and 5 minutes after the intervenção using a calibrated aneroid sphygmomanometer. The high prevalence of arterial hypertension as a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases highlights the urgent need for innovative approaches in healthcare. Chronic stress has been shown to exacerbate blood pressure levels, contributing significantly to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Despite this evidence, there remains a limited availability of non-pharmacological, nature-based intervençãos within public healthcare systems, particularly those that could complement traditional medical tratamentos. Furthermore, there is a lack of structured integration of forest bathing practices into public promoção da saúde strategies, which represents a missed opportunity to leverage accessible, low-cost, and effective intervençãos to address chronic diseases such as hypertension. The forest bathing intervenção demonstrated a hypotensive effect in most participants. On average, systolic blood pressure decreased by 15 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure decreased by 10.5 mmHg after intervenção. Most participants exhibited reductions in both systolic and diastolic pressures, suggesting a beneficial cardiovascular response to the nature-based practice. A few individuals showed slight increases in blood pressure levels; however, all of them had baseline readings below the standard normal range (120/80 mmHg), indicating a potential adaptive bioregulatory response. Based on the results of this relato de experiência, it is recommended that forest bathing practices be integrated into saúde pública strategies as complementary intervençãos for the promotion of cardiovascular health and stress management. Given the accessibility and low cost of nature-based intervençãos, forest bathing can be an effective adjunct to conventional care, particularly within primary healthcare settings. Further studies with larger sample sizes, experimental designs, and longitudinal follow-up are necessary to confirm the observed benefits and to better understand the physiological mechanisms underlying the cardiovascular effects of forest exposure. Special attention should be given to developing standardized protocols for forest bathing practices adapted to different population profiles, including individuals with normotension or hypotension. It is also recommended that healthcare providers receive specific training on the application of nature-based intervençãos, in order to promote their safe and effective incorporation into integrative and complementary health programs. Public policies should encourage the preservation of natural environments and the creation of accessible green spaces to support the expansion of such therapeutic practices.",

    "abstract": "Forest bathing is a therapeutic practice based on the Japanese concept of Shinrin-Yoku, which utilizes sensory connection with nature to reduce stress and promote well-being. This practice aligns with the principles of Planetary Health and the One Health concept advocated by the World Health Organization (WHO), which highlights the interdependence among human, environmental, and animal health. Grounded also in the concept of Biophilia  the innate human tendency to connect with nature  forest bathing integrates integral health by addressing physical, mental, and social dimensions while fostering environmental awareness. Implemented in 2024 by the Municipal Center for Integrative Practices (CEMPICS) of São Bento do Sul, the forest bathing program was developed as a collective therapeutic activity, combining conscious breathing exercises, atenção plena practices, meditação, body movements, and environmental education. The initiative aimed to address contemporary challenges related to the pursuit of integral health and the impacts of climate change on individual and collective health. Fourteen weekly sessions were conducted at the Ecoparque do SAMAE, an urban area containing native forest, and were registered in the e-SUS system as collective health activities. Lack of integrative and community-based mental health strategies in saúde pública services  Particularly those that involve non-pharmacological, preventive, and nature-based approaches within the SUS. Limited environmental awareness and disconnection from nature among urban populations  A factor contributing to stress, lifestyle-related illnesses, and environmental neglect. Absence of structured therapeutic protocols using nature exposure in atenção primária  Despite growing evidence of the health benefits of such intervençãos. Need for holistic approaches aligned with Planetary Health and One Health principles  Emphasizing the interdependence between human well-being, biodiversity preservation, and climate change mitigation. Insufficient incorporation of biophilic practices in collective promoção da saúde  Undermining the potential of sensory and emotional reconnection with the environment to foster healthier behaviors and ecosystems. After the 14 sessions, the CEMPICS/Farmácia Viva team distributed an electronic questionnaire through the forest bathing WhatsApp group, containing questions on promoção da saúde, perception of nature, and personal environmental impact. Results indicated that 100% of respondents found forest bathing important for their mental health; 84.6% reported perceiving a positive change in their well-being after participating; 92.3% stated that their perception of the environment and nature had changed; and 92.3% felt more impacted by environmental issues following the experience. Additionally, participants were asked to describe the forest bathing experience in a single word. Reported terms included: \"connection, \"relaxing\", \"essential\", \"therapeutic\", \"re-energizing\", \"magical\", \"wonderful\" and \"peace\". Throughout the sessions, the professional team observed progressive changes in participants' relationships with the natural environment. Over time, participants reported developing a sense of care and affection for the trail, feeling a sense of belonging. These narratives reinforced the effects of forest bathing in stimulating biophilia and highlighted the importance of nature-based therapeutic practices for fostering this connection. The experience of the 14 forest bathing sessions organized by CEMPICS/Farmácia Viva demonstrated the reach of the practice in promoting integral health and environmental awareness. Beyond individual benefits, forest bathing stood out as a strategy aligned with the \"One Health\" concept currently advocated by WHO. This integrated approach is relevant in times of climate crises, reinforcing the intrinsic link between planetary health and the health of people, plants, and animals. The participants' chosen words to describe forest bathing reflect the reach of the practice and its ability to foster environmental awareness and self-care. This intervenção model represents an advancement in promoção da saúde strategies within the SUS, uniting integral health and environmental consciousness. Implementing nature-based intervençãos emerges as a feasible strategy to address contemporary challenges related to human and planetary health. Expanding this initiative to other municipalities and conducting long-term impact studies are recommended to consolidate nature-based practices as strategic tools for promoting individual and planetary health within the SUS framework",

    "abstract": "The Gestational Center Harmony for Life in São Sebastião, situated on the coastline of the state of São Paulo, is an initiative born out of the confluence of the Waiting Room Florescer and the Health Center II. This pioneering service in Brazil, and in the world, was conceived by obstetrical nurse and doula Carla Bruço, and inaugurated on March 2020. It offers humanized prenatal activities based on pre- & perinatal psychology, as well as integrative health practices. Situated in a picturesque place, this Gestational Center is welcoming, joyous and harmonious, thus fostering well-being and health for women during their pregnancy as well as their postpartum period. When a pregnant woman arrives at the Gestational Center, she is seen by an obstetrical nurse who assesses her needs. Then, she has a consultation with a naturopath who counsels her as to which practices to choose. A wealth of integrative therapeutical practices offers to the mother-baby dyad a holistic integration that favors mutual empathy, understanding and respect, thus fostering physical and mental health. A multidisciplinary approach cultivates the physical and psychological integrity of mother and baby, as they delight under the guidance of experts in naturopathy, aromaterapia, Ayurveda, chromoterapia, phytoterapia, stone terapia, meditação, yoga and relaxation techniques, floral terapia, reflexology, Reike, Shantala, thalassoterapia, acupressure, acupuntura, relaxing massage, circle dancing, belly dancing, pilates, integrative community terapia, pelvic physioterapia, art terapia (belly painting, cloth painting, crocheting, belly plaster), music terapia, choir singing and psycho-embryology. High-risk gestational monitoring is a great challenge for the municipality, inserting therapeutic practices as an adjuvant tratamento offers a welcoming and humanized tratamento where pregnant women, postpartum women and babies are received every week. The Gestational Center also offers classes, workshops and meetings, to transmit essential information about the importance of pregnancy and the mind of the prenate, labor, birth, breastfeeding and newborn care. The aim is to inspire women to experience a harmonious pregnancy, birthing, postpartum and breastfeeding  transformative experiences  while valuing natural childbirth, their emotional universe, their social and spiritual impact on their family and community at large. Toward the end of the pregnancy there is a celebration in honor of the pregnant woman, to strengthen and empower her to live fully her experience of birthing a child and taking care of this newborn. Such celebration is called a Blessing Way and it includes a relaxing warm feet-bath that allows for the pregnant mother to welcome some of her most deep-seated emotions and embrace the mothering that awaits her with trust and hope. About 18 couples per month get dedicated attention, so as to strengthen their family bond and promote responsible co-parenting. Fathers are welcome and have the opportunity of joining conversation groups, receive specific guidance and, when necessary, have individual or group terapia sessions. They gather information about fetal and child development, their parenting role, the importance of lending emotional support to their partner, and strategies to face the familys challenges due to new dynamics. Such inclusive approach seeks to help building a solid base for conscious parenting and fosters family well-being. About 500 mothers  pregnant or in their postpartum period , visit per month of mothers who are pregnant or in their postpartum period. The official team in charge of the Gestational Center is composed of 01 obstetrical nurse, 01 servant and 01 administrative person, all the others who work there are volunteers  registered at the municipality. They see to the womens health and well-being. There are also 08 doulas who accompany the women when they are in labor at the Hospital das Clínicas of São Sebastião. The women are seen every week by the obstetrical nurse, enjoy a naturopathy consultation and afterward are sent to several activities, according to their needs. There is a WhatsApp group in which most appointments are scheduled. The Gestational Center Harmony for Life represents an innovative model of prenatal and postpartum care that combines integrative healing practices and the tenets of pre- & perinatal psychology, thus promoting the womens agency, as well as their sense of segurança and plenitude. The aim is for them (and their families) to experience their pregnancy and postpartum feeling valued and respected. This kind of fulfilment has a positive epigenetic impact on the developing prenate and the newborns psychoneurophysiology and brings forth the profound beauty of this fecund cycle life.",

    "abstract": "A recovery-oriented approach is the goal of government funded mental health and addiction services in Alberta, Canada [1]. The Recovery Model adopts a recovery-oriented approach for addiction and mental health to establish a recovery-oriented system of care with a coordinated network of personalized, community-based services for people seeking tratamento for substance use disorders (SUD). This approach is intended to provide access to a continuum of services and supports, from prevenção and intervenção to tratamento and recovery that is free, public, and holistic in practice. A holistic approach means the development of new sustainable, practical and evidence informed innovations focused on the multidimensional aspect to recovery that considers a persons wellbeing, physically, mentally, spiritually, and culturally. Recovery from SUD is multifaceted, often complicated by underlying mental health issues making tratamento challenging and complex. For some individuals living with SUD, a more holistic approach to treat the underlying mental health issues is required. Reliance on current tratamentos has been met with varying or limited success [2], and relapse has been associated with underlying mental health problems. A holistic approach would benefit from integrating non-pharmacological options, collectively known as Traditional Complementary Integrative Medicine (TCIM) [3]. Evidence suggests some TCIM modalities such as yoga [4], meditação [2], and acupuntura [5-8] may be beneficial in the tratamento of SUB and underlying mental health issues. In fact, growing evidence on acupuntura as a tratamento option for SUB and studies of its mechanism of action [9] are relevant to translational medicine [10] to inform an integrated approach to SUB tratamento and recovery. Integration of diverse modalities and practices is limited in biomedicine within North America. To fully achieve a holistic approach, we needed to explore models of integration from other regions. Two current models of integrating diverse modalities are the Integrated Chinese-Western Medicine (ICWM) Pilot Programme in Hong Kong and the Integrated Framework from Singapore. The goal of this Experience Report is to present the development of a translation plan of the integrated models from Hong Kong and Singapore to the Canadian context, and to determine how best to translate the application of the integrated models in Hong Kong and Singapore (using dor crônica as a reference condition) to the integration of tratamento for mental health issues in the context of SUD in Canada. What strategies can be learned from the Hong Kong and Singapore models of integration to inform the development of holistic care approach to treat individuals with mental health issues to recover from SUD in the Canadian context A review of Hong Kongs Integrated Chinese-Western Medicine (ICWM) Pilot Programme and Singapores integration framework provided key procedures and process to the translational plan to integrated acupuntura as a component of recovery tratamento in Alberta Canada. Hong Kongs ICWM, launched in 2014, integrates Traditional Chinese Medicine with Western care in public hospitals. Initially at 8 sites, it expanded to 26 hospitals and 53 service points by 2024 [11]. The programme supports multidisciplinary collaboration, with over 58,000 attendances and 3,560 patients by March 2023 [12]. ICWM complements standard care without disrupting tratamento plans. It enhances multidisciplinary collaboration and has been associated with enhanced clinical insight and improved patient resultados [11]. This model offers a scalable and sustainable framework for delivering holistic, patient-centred care to those in need. Singapore is taking several steps to integrate Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) into its healthcare system, particularly through the Healthier SG initiative [13]. The Ministry of Health is developing collaborative models where TCM practitioners and Western doctors can partner. This collaboration aims to ensure patients receive both TCM and Western medical tratamentos, enhancing overall care quality [14]. They also introduced the TCM Information System (TCMIS) as part of its efforts to integrate TCM into the broader healthcare system and facilitates the digital integration of TCM practices with mainstream healthcare systems. This includes electronic health records that allow for seamless sharing of patient information between TCM practitioners and Western medical professionals. To explore the adaptation of integrated care models for substance use disorder (SUD) tratamento, it is critical to establish an effective, culturally relevant, and sustainable system that enables integration across sectors and disciplines. To extrapolate from the models of Hong Kong and Singapore into the Canadian context, the key considerations include strong clinical governance, collaborative practitioner training, equitable access to services, and the cultivation of public trust [15]. A review of international experiences on the integration strategies for conventional and TCIM healthcare practices identified 1) areas of agreement were leadership to integration, patient demand, and filling efetividade gaps in conventional medicine, while ensuring quality and segurança of TCIM services as a priority; 2) barriers included referral mechanisms due to diverse practice contexts, guidelines on responsibilities across professionals/disciplines, and interprofessional education to establish mutual trust and understanding [16]. The review also identified the strategies to integration must involve patient chart sharing, instant information exchange, and dedicated time for face-to-face interactions. According to Chung and colleagues (2021), learning from condition-specific referral protocols that are evidence based with detailed integrative tratamento planning will inform interprofessional communication as a key to successful integration. Several challenges must be considered from the Canadian context in adapting an integrated healthcare plan for Western conventional care with TCIM. First, establishing rapport and trust among distinct practices and philosophies of care, creating effective communication routes, determining a sustainable payment model for TCIM practitioners within the healthcare system, and streamline processes to avoid duplications and redundancies. Despite these challenges, given the WHOs strategy of integrating TCIM [17], it is to the benefit of the Canadian healthcare system to work towards integration of modalities and offer a breadth of tratamento options.",

    "abstract": "The search for natural well-being has become increasingly important in the face of social and mental health demands. Meditative practices are important strategies for connecting with the natural environment, with oneself, and with others in a loving and peaceful way, and are found within personalized health and tourism itineraries to improve health through this ancient integrative practice. This article describes the impact on health and well-being of meditação experiences and meditative trails in a tourist resort in the state of Sao Paulo in 2024. Case report of meditação and meditative hiking experiences in a resort town in the interior of Sao Paulo in 2024. Resort towns with natural beauty and riches in the state of Sao Paulo are important allies for nature-supported therapies. The search for and offers of tourism for relaxation, connection, rest, and care are becoming increasingly sought after by people in the state of Sao Paulo. Nature-based practices such as meditative trails and meditação in the woods were carried out in the Climatic Resort in the Municipality of Analandia in 5 meetings with 26 participants. Activities planned by an occupational therapist trained in Suseonjae Meditation, a South Korean method that focuses mainly on a breathing process and natural way of life that promotes the balance of the five movements of the body's meridians to ensure health and well-being. Meditative walks in nature are practices offered on site during meditative meetings and, according to participants' final reports, they have fostered processes of self-knowledge, a sense of belonging, sharing of feelings and emotions, as well as improved environmental awareness. Authors such as Figueiredo and Printes (2025) highlight the positive impact of meditative walks in the cerrado (a Brazilian biome in the region) on socio-ecological resilience and social capital due to the collective process experienced by participants.Participants in meditative activities in Analandia demonstrate the impact on their process of relieving stress, ansiedade, improving sleep, and changing perspectives centered on personal problems and experiences for better awareness of the whole and a flexible and expanded vision in the face of challenging life processes at the end of the activities. The evidence of meditação on self-cognition, self-transformation processes and connections is in fact corroborated by science and increasingly shows possibilities for responsible insertion and with qualified professionals within tourism contexts as a way of changing patterns and societal awareness of forms of self-care and planetary care",

    "abstract": "The Brazilian National Policy on Integrative and Complementary Practices (PNPIC), implemented through the Unified Health System (SUS), currently recognizes 29 Integrative and Complementary Health Practices (PICS). These practices have demonstrated growing evidence of efficacy and efetividade, prompting recommendations for their inclusion in the education and training of health professionals. Incorporating PICS into undergraduate curricula, especially in Nursing and other health disciplines, supports a paradigm shift from a disease-centered model to a more holistic, person-centered approach to care, aligned with the principles of integrality and complexity in health. The objective of this work is to report the experience of teaching Auriculoterapia in an undergraduate program at a public university. This is an relato de experiência on the implementation of Auriculoterapia and the training of facilitators linked to a community extension project. A descriptive narrative was chosen, based on theoretical and practical activities developed since the introduction of the first undergraduate discipline in 2021. The project began in 2018, offering five short courses on the basics of Auriculoterapia to nursing and health-related students, with the participation of 179 students. Due to the high demand for Auriculoterapia tratamentos at the projects clinic, undergraduate courses were created to train new Auriculotherapists. The courses are open to any undergraduate student at the university. Three courses are offered throughout the acadêmico year: 1) EN928 - Auriculoterapia I - 45 hours, with 15 hours of Extension Practice. Offered every semester, starting in the second semester of 2021, with 4 offerings: in 2021 (online) with 61 enrolled students, 2022 with 47 students, 2023 with 31 students, and 2024 with 17 students; 2) EN929 - Auriculoterapia II - 45 hours, with 15 hours of Extension Practice. Offered every semester, starting in the first semester of 2022, with 3 offerings: in 2022 with 21 students, 2023 with 21 students, and 2024 with 14 students; 3) EX031 - Auriculoterapia Practice I - 45 hours of extension, with 1 offering in 2023, enrolling 10 students. Over the years, there has been increasing interest from students in other fields, beyond health-related courses. Offering the courses in the evening has enabled nursing studentswhose full-time curriculum prevents them from attending at other timesto participate. As for students from other programs, interest has come through prior contact with PICS or from students who had previously taken the course. To facilitate access to the practices, students work alongside scholarship holders at the Auriculoterapia Clinic maintained by the School of Nursing, providing tratamentos to the internal and external community. An average of 40 tratamentos are carried out weekly. The teaching of Auriculoterapia provides health students with a different approach to care, broadening their perspectives on well-being and tratamento practices. For students from other fields, regardless of their background, training in Auriculoterapia enables access to a care model that integrates body, mind, and emotions. This approach breaks away from the traditional biomedical model and promotes health from a new, more holistic paradigm centered on the individual. Desafios in Integrating PICS into Undergraduate Health Education: - Integration into Traditional Curricula: One of the main challenges is integrating PICS into traditional health education programs, which often follow a biomedical model. This requires overcoming institutional resistance and adapting the curriculum to incorporate more holistic and integrative practices. - Lack of Familiarity with PICS: Many students may not be familiar with PICS. This poses an educational challenge, as students first need to experience these practices in order to become interested and motivated to pursue further training in the area. - Perception and Acceptance of Holistic Practices: There may be skepticism or resistance toward PICS. Auriculoterapia has shown potential to break down these barriers. However, overcoming such skepticism among health students and professionals remains a significant challenge.",

    "abstract": "Throughout the history of medicine, the concepts of health and well-being have undergone profound transformations. From magical-religious rituals, the use of rudimentary tools and reliance on the benefits of nature, to all the scientific and biomedical advances centered on the scientific method, to the segmentation by medical specialty, following the Flexner report in 1910, according to the organs and systems primarily related to the patient's condition. The consolidation of these segmented health systems worldwide today also directs education and research, focusing primarily on diagnoses, pharmacological tratamentos, and hospital-level recovery, rather than on the patient themselves, their multiple interrelated dimensions, and, above all, without the desired preventive-promotional approach, which considers the restoration of functional balance or holistic well-being. This report addresses issues related to the approach to health, requiring a restructuring that complements all the progress made to date. However, it considers a more integrative and functional vision, aimed at restoring the healthy habits necessary to preserve health and even reverse disease. It also seeks to delve deeper, at an acadêmico and scientific level, into the therapeutic potential of nature and its biodiversity, as well as into all ancestral therapies worldwide. For this paradigm shift in health sciences education, more integrative approaches are needed that link all dimensions of the human being, with greater proximity to social reality and a neuroscientific approach that allows for the development of new teaching strategies. Furthermore, these aspects are promoted and complemented by new approaches in scientific research, reoriented toward natural medicine and complementary and integrative therapies, allowing us to understand and demonstrate the human being as a complex and interrelated being in search of balance or homeostasis. The study doesn´t present results The authors' recommendations focus primarily on restructuring the approach to health, considering various actions and challenges in the process: 1. Expand acadêmico training through undergraduate and graduate training, courses, and education in topics such as fitoterapia, ancestral therapies based on worldview, functional medicine and nutrition, and body-mind-spirit therapies. 2. Create a healthcare service at all levels of healthcare, in addition to a medical specialty in integrative medicine, based on a holistic view of health and integrating natural and complementary therapies. 3. Increased interest, through financial and non-financial incentives, in research into natural, complementary, and integrative therapies to promote the development of scientific evidence and motivate students. The implementation of these actions faces multiple challenges, centered primarily on a lack of interest in understanding this integration of medical specialties with the true dimensions of the human being, in addition to the financial interests, often personal, of officials or government agencies that prefer to continue with a system that seeks to make us sick through food, and then keep us chronically on medication, when the solution, through this restructuring, could lead us to true healing or holistic well-being.",

    "abstract": "Uruguay, a South American country of 3.5 million inhabitants, has progressively integrated Traditional, Complementary, and Integrative Medicine (TCIM) into its health system. Since 2001, a series of legal and institutional milestones have laid the foundation for the safe practice and regulation of various TCIM techniques, including acupuntura and homeopatia. The Ministry of Public Health (MSP) plays a central role in the implementation of educational strategies and policy development, with support from acadêmico institutions and international partners. These actions reflect a commitment to equity, interculturality, and integrative health. The initiative is implemented nationwide, targeting both urban and rural health settings. Actions Taken and Resources Used: 1. Legal and Institutional Framework: - 1985: Law No. 15.703 - 2001: Decree 31/01 regulates acupuntura as a medical technique. - 2004: Creation of the Advisory Commission on Traditional Medicines at the Ministry of Health. - 2009: Recognition and regulation of homeopatia as a medical technique. - 2016: Decree 404/016 regulates homeopathic, herbal, and phytotherapeutic medicines. - 2023: Ordinance 2665/023 sets administrative and technical criteria for homeopathic products. Regulatory updates are published on the Ministry of Health. website: https://www.gub.uy/ministerio-salud-publica Regulatory Advances Uruguay has made important strides in the legal regulation of herbal and homeopathic medicines. Key developments include:  Law No. 15.703 (1985), known as the Pharmacy Law, which categorizes homeopathic pharmacies (Category IV) and herbalist shops (Category VI), defining their operational scope and requirements under Ministry of Health oversight. IMPO link: https://www.impo.com.uy/bases/decretos-ley/15703-1985  Decree 404/016 (Homeopathic Medicines): Establishes requirements for the registration, manufacturing, quality control, labeling, distribution, and pharmacovigilance of homeopathic medicines. IMPO link: https://www.impo.com.uy/bases/decretos-originales/404-2016  Decree 403/016 (Herbal Medicines): Updates regulations for the commercialization and segurança of fitoterapias and phytotherapeutic products. It includes best practices aligned with WHO guidelines. IMPO link: https://www.impo.com.uy/bases/decretos/403-2016 These regulatory efforts support patient segurança and market transparency while promoting innovation and access 2. TCIM Techniques in the Health System: - Acupuncture is currently offered by 30% of public and private providers. - Homeopathy is regulated and practiced professionally. - Ayurveda and Traditional Chinese Medicine are practiced primarily in the private sector. 3. Training and Education Strategy (2016Present): - Baseline Mapping: A national survey (20162017) identified training needs and perceptions. - Curriculum Design: Collaboratively developed with universities and the TCIM Americas Network. - Initial Trainings: Hybrid courses delivered to health professionals on acupuntura, phytoterapia, homeopatia, and mind-body techniques. - Trainer Development: Certification of national TCIM trainers and creation of modular, context-specific materials. - Naturopathy education in Uruguay has traditionally been self-taught. Since 2013, the Naturopathy School of Uruguay, registered with the Ministry of Education and Culture, has offered a structured program based on WHO benchmark criteria. - Institutional Integration: Launch of the first university diploma in acupuntura (CLAEH, 2021). 4. International and National Engagement: - Participation in the 2023 WHO Global Summit on Traditional Medicine. - Contributions to the new WHO Global Strategy on Traditional and Complementary Medicine. - National provider survey (2024) to map the scope of TCIM use in health services. - Technical exchanges with China via the Uruguayan Agency for International Cooperation (AUCI). 5. Ongoing Advancements: - Drafting of new regulations for additional TCIM practices. - Development of a national registry of certified TCIM practitioners. This initiative addresses multiple gaps in Uruguays health and education systems: - Lack of formal training and institutional knowledge in TCIM. - Absence of unified curricula and competencies for healthcare professionals. - Limited integration of TCIM in conventional healthcare services. - Weak regulation of herbal and homeopathic products prior to 2016. - Rising public demand for baseado em evidence integrative therapies. - More than 1,000 healthcare professionals trained nationwide. - Strengthened national and regional collaboration. - Institutional recognition of TCIM within the Ministry of Health. National Leadership and Strategic Alignment Since 2021, the Ministry of Public Health, has taken decisive steps to strengthen the role of TCIM in national política de saúde. Uruguays leadership has aligned with PAHO/WHO strategies, participating in high-level meetings such as the WHO Global Summit on Traditional Medicine held in Gandhinagar, India, in 2023, and the Ibero-American Intergovernmental Initiative for the articulation of policies in TCIM. Uruguays inclusion in the TCIM Americas Network and WHO Global Network of Focal Points further reinforced its institutional commitment. Development of Human Resources and Education From 2022 onwards, Uruguay implemented continuous training for healthcare professionals through initiatives such as: The national TCIM virtual course, with more than 400 professionals from various health subsectors trained in foundational concepts and baseado em evidence practices. In-person national TCIM training workshops, implemented with support from PAHO, which included lectures, practical exercises, and interdisciplinary dialogue, targeting atenção primária teams across the country. Exchanges with acadêmico institutions such as the University of the Republic (Udelar), University CLAEH, and Catholic University of Uruguay, contributing to curricula development and interprofessional engagement. Participation in the acadêmico exchange session with Henan University of Chinese Medicine, held at the Ministry of Health in November 2023, with three Uruguayan universities. This session addressed the integration of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) into national health systems, focusing on its role in disease prevenção, tratamento, and rehabilitation. These actions were aimed at sensitizing, informing, and strengthening the skills of healthcare professionals in the use and referral of TCIM in clinical practice. Intersectoral and International Cooperation Uruguay has strengthened collaboration with international and regional stakeholders through: Active participation in WHO and PAHO technical networks and regional cooperation initiatives. Engagement in the TCIM Americas Network, including technical contributions to research, virtual platforms, and policy dialogue. Collaboration with Indias Ministry of AYUSH and acadêmico entities for knowledge exchange. Hosting a bilateral acadêmico exchange between Henan University and three Uruguayan medical universities (Udelar, CLAEH, and Catholic University), fostering future South-South cooperation. - Institutionalization: Include TCIM within health and education policies at a strategic level. - Sustainability: Secure funding and staff for the long-term continuation of TCIM programs. - Monitoring and Evaluation: Implement indicators to evaluate segurança, efetividade, and quality. - Scientific Research: Foster national research on TCIM to inform policy and practice. - Cultural Shift: Continue engaging the biomedical community to reduce stigma and build trust.",

    "abstract": "This review explores the application of Ayurvedic principles and protocols to support womens health at every stage of lifefrom infancy through menopause and elder care. It highlights structured approaches from classical Ayurveda such as Bla Saskra (child development), Garbha Saskra (prenatal care), and Rasyana terapia (rejuvenation), integrating them within the global Traditional, Complementary, and Integrative Medicine (TCIM) landscape. The work is grounded in the need for gender-sensitive, preventive, and culturally congruent healthcare systems and aims to contribute to policy and practice discussions globally. The need for sustainable, culturally aligned, and gender-specific healthcare for women across different life stages. Limited integration of Ayurvedic womens health protocols in mainstream or TCIM policy frameworks. Gaps in preventive care for menstrual health, reproductive longevity, and menopausal wellness. Fragmented maternal care systems lacking holistic prenatal and postnatal approaches. The underutilization of traditional developmental practices in early childhood and elder care. Ayurvedic life-stage-specific protocols show promise in enhancing reproductive health, cognitive and emotional development, hormonal balance, and graceful aging. Integrative implementation may reduce the chronic disease burden, improve qualidade de vida, and empower women through personalized preventive care. The inclusion of Ayurvedic maternal and postnatal care protocols (e.g., Masnumsika Paricharya, Sutika Paricharya) can complement biomedical care with dietary, psychological, and physiological support. Recomendações: Encourage policy-level integration of validated Ayurvedic protocols into maternal and women's health programs. Promote interdisciplinary training of healthcare providers in Ayurveda-based women's health. Support longitudinal research and clinical validation of Ayurvedic intervençãos for diverse life stages. Include Garbha Saskra and Rasyana-based strategies in community health initiatives for reproductive and menopausal care. Desafios: Need for stronger institutional support, funding, and international collaboration for clinical research in Ayurvedic women's health. Limited awareness and accessibility of structured Ayurvedic guidelines among general public and health professionals. Regulatory and legal frameworks in some countries still restrict the formal integration of traditional practices.",

    "abstract": "Southern California University of Health Sciences (SCU), located in California, USA, is undergoing a comprehensive institutional transformation through its Whole Health University initiative. This effort embeds a Whole Health framework not only across acadêmico and clinical programs but also into the fabric of the universitys cultureredefining how health professions education is conceived, delivered, and experienced. Objectives The initiative aims to: 1) Integrate Whole Health principles into acadêmico and clinical training as well as institutional culture; 2) Prepare graduates to deliver whole-person, value-based care; 3) Align university systems with the quadruple aim and global health priorities. Motivation U.S. healthcare systems face escalating costs, worsening resultados, and a provider burnout crisis. Education models have struggled to evolve in step with the need for integrative, prevenção-focused care. SCU addresses this gap by adapting the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) baseado em evidence Whole Health modelshown to improve satisfaction, reduce opioid use, and enhance workforce well-beingto a university-wide setting. Methodology & Participants This submission qualitativoly describes the methods of an institutional initiative currently in progress. SCU is implementing a three-year, staged plan involving: 1) Whole Health training for students, faculty, and staff; 2) Integration of Whole Health into curricula, clinical workflows, and campus systems; 3) Mixed-methods evaluation of feasibility, acceptability, and early impact. Participants include students, faculty, and staff across interprofessional acadêmico programs (e.g., Chiropractic, Acupuncture, Ayurveda, PA, OT, Genetic Counseling, Whole Health Leadership), SCU Health clinical teams, and operational leaders across campus. In 2023, U.S. healthcare spending reached $4.8 trillion, yet resultados remain poor relative to peer nations. Chronic disease, inequities, and provider burnout persist. Traditional health professions education has largely remained reactive and fragmented, failing to prepare practitioners to address these systemic challenges. SCUs initiative responds by embedding Whole Health principles into all levels of training and care. Drawing from the VA modelshown to improve patient engagement, reduce opioid use, and enhance workforce satisfactionSCU aims to shift acadêmico culture and build a workforce equipped for whole-person care. The initiative also responds to priorities set by the World Health Organization and the NIH, including person-centered, integrated, and preventive care. It supports development of a resilient, community-engaged workforce trained to deliver care aligned with patient values, purpose, and well-being. SCU has encountered several challenges during early implementation: 1) Cultural resistance and change fatigue: Some faculty and staff are skeptical or concerned about added workload; 2) Competing priorities: Institutional bandwidth is limited, and clear incentives are needed for sustained engagement; 3) Resource limitations: Ongoing investment in training and coordination is needed, especially without external funding; 4) Operational complexity: Embedding Whole Health into curricula, policies, and clinical workflows requires cross-departmental collaboration; 5) Evaluation constraints: Building a meaningful evidence base will take time, and early skepticism can arise without immediate results. Despite these challenges, SCUs approach provides a framework for addressing foundational barriers in health professions education. SCUs Whole Health University initiative is in early implementation. Completed activities include: 1) Leadership alignment across acadêmico, clinical, and administrative areas; 2) Campus-wide awareness-building through forums and introductory presentations; 3) Development and launch of a three-year Whole Health training program; 4) Design of a research framework to evaluate feasibility, resultados, and institutional impact. Evaluation aims include: 1) Assessing feasibility and acceptability of Whole Health training; 2) Tracking changes in satisfaction, engagement, and performance among faculty, staff, and students; 3) Monitoring policy and procedural changes at the institutional level; 4) Measuring self-efficacy, well-being, and qualidade de vida indicators; 5) Exploring stakeholder perceptions of Whole Health and its future applicability. Mixed-methods data collection includes institutional surveys (e.g., HERI, Great Colleges to Work For), retention/absenteeism metrics, and qualitativo interviews and focus groups. Baseline measurement and initial training activities are launching in the current acadêmico year. SCUs early experience offers guidance for institutions seeking to implement similar transformations. Key recommendations include: 1) Secure leadership support early, and engage faculty and staff through transparent communication and staged participation; 2) Establish a structured evaluation framework at the outset to track adaptation, progress, and impact; 3) Anticipate cultural and operational resistance, and proactively address concerns through workload planning, incentives, and cross-functional collaboration; 4) Embed Whole Health into institutional systemsonboarding, professional development, and student supportto promote sustainability. While measurable resultados are still in development, SCUs structured, staged approach has fostered early alignment and engagement. This model may offer a roadmap for other institutions seeking to cultivate healthier campus cultures and prepare graduates for the future of healthcare.",

    "abstract": "This study is an relato de experiência, approved by the Research Ethics Committee, opinion number 7.498.693, which describes the use of yoga classes as an integrative tool in the tratamento of obesity through hospitalization with multidisciplinary support, low-calorie diets (5001000 kcal/day) and supervised physical exercises, between 2016 and 2023. Data such as sex, age, weight and length of hospitalization were collected from electronic medical records. Yoga classes were held daily, lasting 40 minutes, based on the principles of Hatha Yoga. The structure of the sessions prioritized breathing techniques (pranayama), adapted postures (asana), meditação (dhyana) and atenção plena, respecting the physical and emotional limitations of the participants. Patients with reduced mobility participated in the classes, with adapted movements, using their wheelchairs. The environment was prepared with tatami mats, mattresses and ergonomic chairs with high load capacity, as well as natural lighting, promoting relaxation and concentration. Conducting yoga classes for hospitalized obese patients required constant adaptation of practices to meet motor limitations. The postures were adjusted individually, prioritizing cardiorespiratory segurança and physical comfort. From a psychosocial point of view, initial resistance to the practice was observed on the part of some patients, who often had a history of ansiedade, low self-esteem, depressão and difficulty in dealing with introspection. The professional approach needed to be sensitive, gradual and focused on welcoming, using accessible language and building a therapeutic bond. The study included 350 patients with grade I, II and III obesity, aged between 12 and 90 years, of both sexes, with no clinical contraindications for the practice. The majority were female (68%), with an average age of 46±17 years, average BMI of 43±6 kg/m², average weight of 117±22 kg and average length of hospital stay of 118±47 days. The experience indicated that the inclusion of yoga in the hospital environment was feasible and enabled, throughout the sessions, greater adherence by patients to the practice, with spontaneous reports of well-being, reduced ansiedade and improved body perception. Regular experience of breathing techniques, accessible postures and atenção plena contributed to strengthening the bond with one's own body and to developing self-care attitudes, essential aspects in processes of lifestyle change. The progressive engagement of patients signals the potential of yoga as a complementary resource in promoting self-regulation and body awareness in individuals with obesity in hospitalization. Implementing yoga classes in hospital settings requires the instructor's technical knowledge and experience to adapt the techniques to the patients' conditions. Experience has shown that introducing hospital yoga can be a complementary strategy in the fight against obesity, as it helps to strengthen the body-mind bond and acts as a therapeutic tool to combat ansiedade, food urges and low self-esteem, which are aspects frequently present in this patient profile and relevant to tratamento adherence.",

    "abstract": "This is a qualitativo study characterized as a narrative relato de experiência by a Family and Community Medicine resident during an elective internship in the city of João Pessoa, focused on health services offering Integrative and Complementary Practices (PICs) in June 2024. It´s objective is to describe the learning and critical thinking developed by a medical resident from the city of Rio de Janeiro during and after the internship in João Pessoa. The research was made prioriting articles published between 2020 and 2024, collected from the BVS, Pubmed, and Oasis Br platforms. In addition, it was included papers from Brazilian authors who are references in the context of the topic addressed: Madel Luz, Charles Tesser, Marilene Cabral do Nascimento, and Gustavo Tenório Cunha. The National Policy on Integrative and Complementary Practices (PNPIC) was established through Ordinance No. 971/2006 in response to the increasing availability of medical therapies derived from Traditional, Alternative, and Complementary Medicine in Brazils saúde pública services. Currently, these practices are most commonly found in Primary Health Care. In João Pessoa, capital of Paraíba state, implementation began in 2007, and in January 2008, Municipal Law No. 1655 officially integrated PICs into the municipal health system. In this context, PICs are offered in Basic Health Units, Ambulatory Centers, and two high-complexity institutions, wich Traditional Chinese Medicine is notably used for pain management. According to documents provided by the PICs management group of the João Pessoa´s Health Department, various practices are implemented in Secondary Care. The most frequently recorded in the first quarter of 2024 were auriculoterapia, acupuntura, flower terapia, and meditação. During this period, a total of 8,819 procedures were recorded across four outpatient centers. The rotation included placements in secondary and primary healthcare units, two PICs centers, one outpatient clinic, and one Primary Health Unit, where professionals such as physiotherapists, acupuncturists, massage therapists, and other health professionals provide care. It was a four-week elective rotation in PICs services in the capital of Paraíba. The resident observed practices from Traditional Chinese Medicine, such as acupuntura and auriculoterapia, as well as myofascial pain management techniques including massage terapia, cupping terapia, and dry needling. The units also offered groups in Family Constellation Therapy; Mens and Womens Groups; Self-Esteem Management; and Yoga. As in other Brazilian cities, João Pessoa faces both strengths and challenges regarding the services that provide integrative care in the city of João Pessoa. Primary Health Care (PHC) is the gateway for users of Brazils Unified Health System (SUS). PHC is tasked with providing comprehensive care with a family and community focus, which aligns with the goals of integrative and complementary practices. However, biomedical care tends to be prioritized, often due to a lack of knowledge among PHC professionals and mistrust among users. In this case, greater encouragement from managers and institutional support would be necessary so that culture and technology standards are decoupled and new PICS are accepted. The lack of knowledge among health professionals reflects the limited promotion and inclusion of these therapies in university curriculum. Studies show that many medical and health training programs fail to incorporate PICs education, contrary to the goals of the PNPIC. Among already graduated professionals, especially those in atenção primária, some seek PICs training independently, often funding it themselves. This highlights a lack of investment and institutional support from health managers. Another issue is that secondary care clinics tend to serve fewer patients. This may be due to territorial access, users living closer to the services are more likely to attend and also due to referral processes and waiting lists. Furthermore, due to the smaller number of places available, there is a socio-familiar distance, where it can be thought that, even in community approaches, practices tend not to be implemented in family approaches. These practices are associated with longitudinal care and stronger patient-provider relationships. In the PHC setting, there is an ideal environment for implementing complementary therapies. At the same time, PICs have been integrated into secondary and tertiary care services, especially when supported by PHC to ensure continuity and comprehensiveness of care. In situations where PHC may not be providing adequate care, services can be better integrated, for instance, by incorporating PICs into routine health unit operations. One strategy is to allocate specific time slots or shifts for PHC professionals to incorporate PICs into their consultations. In units where professionals introduce PICs to users, strategies are often used to ensure they are included in care plans. These typically take three forms: shifts dedicated solely to PICs; integration with other PHC activities; or both approaches combined. However, these activities often occur outside of the standard institutional schedule and lack formal support. Studies justify these strategies by pointing to challenges such as insufficient physical space, limited resources, and rigid scheduling, which are the main factors that make it difficult to practice PICS in atenção primária. This elective rotation demonstrated that, when considering physical, economic, and social aspects, PICs allow a broader understanding of users needs. When we consider Family and Community Medicine, the care provided includes beyond treating illness, unique communication skills and continuity of care for the person, their family and social environment. Understanding the PICs policy and services in João Pessoa as simple, cost-effective, and somewhat intimate forms of care made this a significant and enriching experience during medical residency training. It could be suggested that residents in this external internship understand PICS management in terms of financing and organization, so that it can be used as a tool in the process of improving projects for the healthcare system.",

    "abstract": "The ComTato Yoga Therapy Program, developed by the Yoga Therapy Center of the ZENcancer Institute, is an innovative and sensitive initiative operating at the intersection of integrative health practices and oncological care. Since 2021, it has aimed to offer a holistic and humanized approach focused on qualidade de vida and the physical, psycho-emotional, and spiritual well-being of groups of patients facing cancer. The ZENcancer Institute (IZC), founded in 2018 by Luciana Loboa yoga teacher and master in Microbiology from UFRJemerged from her personal experience with cancer. This journey inspired the creation of a project dedicated to promoting yoga as a complementary practice in oncological care, aiming to support patient well-being. Today, the Institutes core mission is to provide care through a range of integrative and complementary health practices, improving qualidade de vida and fostering balance between body, mind, and spirit, in alignment with saúde pública policies. Within this context, the Yoga Therapy Center was established in 2020 through the initiative of Lilian Aboim, an integrative yoga teacher and yoga therapist. She invited a group of yoga therapistsher students trained in Integrative Yoga Therapyto develop what became the ComTato Program. The name reflects the programs emphasis on sensory awareness, bodily connection, balance through care and atenção plena, and the importance of human relationships. Currently, the center has nine volunteer yoga therapists residing in the states of Rio de Janeiro, Santa Catarina, Espírito Santo, and Goiás. The first edition of the program was held in 2021 in an online, synchronous formatan approach that continues todayallowing participation from various regions of Brazil and other countries where IZC is active. Offered annually, the program is exclusively available to registered IZC patients, regardless of cancer type or stage of tratamento. It provides practical tools and strategies to help manage symptoms, reduce side effects, and strengthen emotional well-being. According to the International Association of Yoga Therapists (IAYT, 2025), yoga terapia is the process of enabling individuals to progress toward improved health and well-being through the application of the teachings and practices of Yoga. The methodology of Integrative Yoga Therapy is rooted in traditional yogic principles and is adapted to meet the specific health conditions of each individual or group. It is a gradual process of harmonizing body, breath, mind, and emotions, guiding participants back to their inner essencecharacterized by fullness and wholenesseven in the face of lifes polarities. The ComTato Program was developed in alignment with this methodology, designed specifically for groups of cancer patients. It respects individual limitations and requires no prior yoga experience. Its structure encourages the sharing of experiences among participants, a fundamental element of the program. For this reason, group size is limited to ten participants per cycle. Each edition includes eight weekly thematic sessions, lasting 1 hour and 45 minutes, led by two yoga therapists. The themes are progressively interconnected, encouraging participants to incorporate the values explored in class into their daily lives through simple home pleasures. Sessions are organized to address the dimensions of body, breath, mind, emotions, and spirit, promoting integrated self-awareness and self-care. The techniques used include gentle, mindful movements that stimulate circulation, support joint mobility, and relieve muscle tension, thereby reducing pain. Comfortable postures promote stretching and strength, improving posture and balance. Breathing exercises help expand lung capacity, counteract restrictive patterns, and reduce ansiedade while enhancing vitality. Relaxation practices at the end of each session offer calm, inner peace, and connection to subtle aspects of the self. Affirmative phrases, hand gestures (mudras), and visualizations are used to support emotional balance and foster self-esteem and confidence. Cancer is a chronic non-communicable disease with major saúde pública implications. Studies show that cancer patients often experience low self-esteem, fear, frustration, and difficulty coping with loss and change. The disease leads to neurological and physiological changes that can result in chronic stress, sleep disturbances, fatigue, poor concentration, and hopelessness. These emotional impacts, often underdiagnosed, highlight the need for supportive intervençãos that enhance emotional resilience and qualidade de vida. Research indicates that stress, ansiedade, and fatigue negatively affect tratamento response and recovery (Sadja & Mills, 2013). The Scientific Evidence Map of Yoga Practice (CABSIN; BIREME/PAHO/WHO) (BVS, 2021) provides further support for yoga as an effective practice for chronic conditions, including cancer. Systematic reviews have shown that yoga intervençãos reduce fatiguea common side effect of cancerand promote improvements in both physical and mental energy (Sadja & Mills, 2013). A study conducted by USP and Hospital Albert Einstein demonstrated that yogic breathing techniques can foster brain changes associated with reduced ansiedade and increased positive emotions (Novaes et al., 2020). From 2021 to 2024, the program has served four patient groups, totaling 31 participantsmostly women. Outcome analysis is based on pre- and post-program self-perception questionnaires. Preliminary results show that nearly 40% of participants reported improvements in how rested they felt upon waking and in their vitality at the end of the day. Around 30% indicated better breathing, reduced ansiedade, greater emotional flexibility, and increased joy in daily life. Decreases in fatigue, improved sleep, and enhanced mental clarity were also observed. Participant feedback reinforces these results, often highlighting increased serenity and self-confidence. Testimonials include: With deep gratitude, as it was a moment of deepening and reflection on my relationship with myself and with everything that surrounds us. The program was wonderful and allowed me to dedicate myself more to my body, mind, and breathing. It was exceptional! Yoga terapia certainly made me blossom again. I thought I would never find contentment and balance again. The program faces expected challenges, including managing differences among participants and limitations inherent to the online synchronous format. A future goal is to expand in-person offerings in cities where IZC is present and where yoga therapists reside. By participating in this congress, the team aims to broaden the visibility of the Institutes volunteer-based health initiatives, foster new partnerships and sponsorships, and welcome more participants to benefit from the programs integrative care. Another key objective is to encourage students and researchers to engage in studies based on the data already generated by the program.",

    "abstract": "In Brazil, Integrative and Complementary Health Practices (PICs) have contributed to strengthening the core principles of the countrys saúde pública system. In Higher Education Institutions, social responsibility is expressed through the universitys triad mission: Teaching, Research, and Extension. Since 1996, the Center for Studies and Research in Homeopathy and Phytoterapia (NEPHF), in partnership with the Department of Biomedical Sciences at the Federal University of Paraíba, has carried out actions involving various integrative therapies. Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs), digital tools, and social media have been used to broaden access to this knowledge. This current initiative is an relato de experiência from the extension workers engaged in the Path of PICs project, which began on August 1, 2024, and aims to increase access to activities and knowledge related to PICs developed within NEPHF/UFPB, through the dissemination of audiovisual content on digital platforms, such as Instagram. A working group was formed to recover, develop, and publish content and activities related to PICs on NEPHF's website and across social networks. Extension workers were trained both in the theoretical foundations of PICs and in the technical aspects of digital platforms and audiovisual production. Additionally, open-access lectures have been held online and are available on the YouTube channel Cinema e Cuidado. In-person experiential sessions with various PICs were also conducted, primarily involving extension students. The implementation team includes professors, technical staff, and students from health-related programs (dentistry, medicine, and biomedical sciences), with the estimated audience comprising students from Brazilian and international health education institutions, healthcare professionals, holistic therapists, and the general population interested in learning about the practical application of PICs in promoção da saúde and well-being. A survey of NEPHF/UFPB documents and archives has been conducted to catalog PICs-related actions. As a result, historical content has been compiled and made available to the university community and the public. This extension initiative emerged in response to several challenges. First, access to knowledge about Integrative and Complementary Health Practices (PICs) remains limited, both within acadêmico settings and among the general population. There is also a gap between technical health training and the holistic, humanized approach required for comprehensive care. Many students enter their professional paths without exposure to alternative therapeutic perspectives that value the individual as a whole. Additionally, the limited use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) by health extension projects hinders broader dissemination of knowledge. The project also responds to the lack of institutional visibility and recognition of PICs, aiming to recover and highlight their historical contributions through NEPHF/UFPB. Finally, it seeks to strengthen the universitys social responsibility by bridging the divide between acadêmico knowledge and community engagement, offering students tools for more empathetic and interdisciplinary professional development. Our question was in what ways does the involvement of extension students influence their professional development and the advancement of comprehensive healthcare through Integrative and Complementary Health Practices (PICS) The students testimonials are shared below: Throughout this journey, I realized that beyond technical knowledge, it was possible to embrace the human being in their wholeness, acknowledging the multiple aspects of well-being. This experience became a turning point, opening a new horizon full of meaning and hope. Participating in The Path of PICs enriched my acadêmico journey, enhancing my awareness of the imbalances that affect human beings and the diverse therapeutic approaches available for self-care and care for others. Furthermore, the project played a key role in shaping my professional decisions regarding the care practices I intend to adopt in my future career. The experiences, lectures, and studies on PICs were fundamental not only in building the professional I will become. I especially highlight the study of the Saint Germain Flower System and Usui and Tibetan Reiki, two practices to which I developed a strong connection. I had the opportunity to be initiated into Reiki I. I feel deeply grateful for everything I experienced through this extension activity. It is more than new knowledgeit is a life-changing journey, a shift in worldview and personality. It is a path of evolution from which the traveler no longer wishes to return. The Path of PICs project was and continues to be a great discovery. More than replicating these practices in educational settings, it seeks to understand the meaning and foundational roots that make PICs so significant. My experience in the project was strongly marked by the historical role of NEPHF in disseminação PICs to both acadêmico and non-acadêmico audiences. Looking at its past, one can see how much the center has contributed to increasing public awareness about the importance of PICs, evoking a strong sense of institutional pride. Promote broader integration of PICs into the formal curriculum of health education programs. Encourage the continued training of students not only in technical health content but also in humanized, interdisciplinary care approaches. Expand the use of digital media and ICTs to enhance outreach and public education regarding integrative practices. Strengthen institutional recognition and support for PICs within acadêmico environments. Continue recovering and preserving the historical memory of PICs initiatives within universities as a foundation for future innovations in care and education.",

    "abstract": "The post-COVID-19 condition, also known as long COVID (LCO), was classified by the WHO as a disease in October 2021. This condition is characterized by the development or persistence of symptoms after three months of initial infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, lasting at least two months, and without an alternative diagnostic explanation. Although symptoms such as fatigue, difficulty breathing, and cognitive problems are common, there are more than 200 persistent symptoms. Since these symptoms can vary widely among individuals, the tratamento of LCO requires personalized and multifaceted approaches. Given the impact of LC on lifestyle and mental health, non-pharmacological strategies that are already known are crucial in managing some of the manifestations. In this context, Yoga, an ancient practice that originated in India around 5,000 years ago, has been gaining popularity worldwide for years as an integrative approach to physical and mental well-being. Although it encompasses several styles, the practice involves postures (asanas), breathing techniques (pranayama) and meditação (Dhyna). There are many research and clinical practice challenges in the post-COVID-19 condition, particularly related to effective tratamentos. Therefore, it is essential that health professionals obtain detailed information about the patient's experience with Yoga classes, during and after tratamento, in order to improve the understanding and management of the post-COVID-19 condition. General objective: To offer a weekly group Yoga practice that provides physical and mental care for post-COVID-19 conditions and to analyze patients' perceptions after the intervenção. Specific objectives: To analyze the perceptions of patients with post-COVID-19 conditions about the general benefits achieved with the practice of Yoga;  To analyze patients' perceptions about the benefits of practicing Yoga in managing post-COVID-19 conditions;  To identify the barriers that hinder patients' adherence to Yoga classes. The action returned at the UBS in Arroio Trinta - SC, refers to a collective Yoga practice that began in 2013, with reference to the practice and work on the Ministry of Health website. The data in this summary refer to the period from 03/23/2022 to 11/30/2022. Participants were recruited through active search. Individuals with a laboratory or clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 were included, without stratification regarding the severity of the disease, age 18 years, after the infection phase. Hatha Yoga is a practice that seeks to balance body and mind through postures (asanas), breathing and meditação. This line of Yoga works not only the physical body, but also the mind, emotions and the spiritual aspect. Classes were held at the UBS on Wednesdays from 5:30 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. The equipment used included mats, mats, sound equipment, and a room with adequate space. Breathing techniques (pranayamas) were performed, followed by guided and oriented sequences of postures, ending with meditação on topics relevant to self-knowledge, interpersonal relationships, and connections with nature. The practice was adapted so that students could respect their physical and mental limitations. In addition, information about integrative health was shared during classes. After the intervenção, participants were interviewed by telephone or in person at the UBS regarding their perception of benefits and barriers through a semi-structured interview. Twenty-five Yoga classes were offered from March 23, 2022 to November 30, 2022, totaling 178 sessions. Sixteen patients with an average age of 51 years participated in the classes, of which 14 (87.5%) were women. In total, 40 benefits of practicing Yoga in managing the post-COVID-19 condition were described, grouped after analysis into 10 subgroups. The subgroup improved breathing was the most prevalent (n=11), followed by improved mental and emotional health (n=8), described by patients as improved ansiedade; emotional well-being; ansiedade control; emotional improvement; mood; control of ansiedade and post-COVID depressão. Regarding patients perception of the general benefits achieved through the practice of Yoga, a total of 37 benefits were cited, grouped into 11 subgroups. The most frequent subgroups were increased flexibility (n=7) and improved mental and emotional health (n=7), described respectively by patients as improved elasticity, stretching and flexibility and improved ansiedade and depressão; emotional relief; improved psychological state; more balanced emotional state; increased tranquility and calm; joy. Regarding the perception of barriers to the practice of Yoga, 8 patients reported barriers related to work and 8 reported that the schedule made participation difficult, followed by health problems (of the participant and family) (n=5) and travel problems (n=1). Only one patient did not report any barriers. This action aimed to offer a weekly group Yoga practice and analyze patients' perceptions after the intervenção. In 2022, 178 Yoga sessions were offered to patients with post-COVID conditions; All patients perceived and reported benefits of practicing Yoga in general and in managing the post-COVID-19 condition; The most frequent perception of the benefits of practicing Yoga in managing the post-COVID-19 condition were improved breathing and improved mental and emotional health; In general, increased flexibility and improved emotional aspects were the most reported benefits; The main perceptions of barriers to participation are related to work and class schedule.",

    "abstract": "Abstract: This report presents the implementation of Integrative Community Therapy (ICT) circles at the Health Sciences Center of UFES  Maruípe campus (Vitória/ES), conducted by an interdisciplinary team from the iPICS research group. The initiative aims to offer ICT as a collective care practice to graduate students in Public Health, as well as Nursing and Medical students. The experience highlights the potential of this integrative practice in promoting mental health, especially when used complementarily to institutional services that provide psychosocial, pedagogical, and health support to students at this university campus. This report presents the experience developed by an interdisciplinary team composed of a psychologist, a physician, and a nurse  all trained in Integrative Community Therapy (ICT) and members of the research group Investigation in Integrative and Complementary Practices in Health (iPICS), affiliated with the Graduate Program in Public Health (PPGSC) at the Health Sciences Center (CCS) of the Federal University of Espírito Santo (UFES). This team implemented ICT circles in available classrooms at the center. The initiative emerged as part of the activities of the course Positive Mental Health, offered in the second semester of 2024 as part of the PPGSC. ICT was used as both a pedagogical and therapeutic tool for welcoming, integrating, and strengthening bonds among students. The course, offered for the first time in UFESs graduate program, deepened the concept of positive mental health, addressing it holistically  as the presence of well-being, autonomy, and resilience, and not merely the absence of mental disorders (Jahoda, 1958). Initially, ICT participation was limited to graduate students within the program. However, from 2025 onwards, the circles also began to welcome undergraduate Nursing and Medical students, thereby expanding their reach within the university community. ICT was developed in 1987 by Brazilian psychiatrist and anthropologist Dr. Adalberto Barreto, during visits to the Pirambu community in Fortaleza, in collaboration with residents from the Social Medicine program at the Federal University of Ceará. Since 2017, ICT has been included in the National Policy on Integrative and Complementary Practices (PNPIC) by the Ministry of Health (ABRATECOM, 2019). It is also worth noting that this initiative is part of a broader and multicenter project titled Promotion of Positive Mental Health in Health Students, which involves institutions from Brazil, Portugal, and Colombia. Entering higher education marks a period of intense transformation, often involving distance from family and friends, and the need to adapt to new acadêmico and social demands. This context can contribute to the onset of psychological distress, affecting acadêmico performance and personal development. Studies indicate that university students have a higher prevalence of mental disorders compared to the general population, with estimates ranging from 15% to 25%, underscoring the urgent need for mental healthcare strategies in university settings (JUNIOR et al., 2022). In this scenario, Integrative Community Therapy (ICT) emerges as a promising practice, capable of fostering a space for dialogue, attentive listening, exchange, and connection  structured by clear rules. From a presented problem, ICT facilitates the emergence of coping strategies for everyday challenges in an atmosphere of compassion and freedom, free from projections and manipulation. ICT strengthens self-esteem, resilience, empowerment, and social bonds, enabling a sense of belonging to a solidarity network (Barreto et al., 2020). The implementation of ICT in the university setting revealed significant dilemmas and challenges. Among the dilemmas are tensions with the dominant biomedical model in health-related courses, the lack of institutional training for ICT facilitators, and the dependence on political and structural support for its sustainability. Without such support, the initiative risks remaining a one-off action, rather than becoming integrated into the universitys mental política de saúde. Among the challenges is the need for UFES to implement ICT training programs for faculty, staff, and students, aiming to expand the availability of circles to students from other health-related courses. Moreover, it is crucial to integrate this complementary practice into the conventional mental health services offered at the university, including Psychology, Psychiatry, and Nursing  recognizing that ICT is not intended to replace these services, but to act as a complementary care strategy. Finally, it is recommended to expand scientific research evaluating the potential benefits of ICT in promoting mental health in university contexts. References JAHODA, M.

    "abstract": "Pediatric palliative care (PPC) prevents, identifies, and treats the suffering of children and adolescents with life-threatening and life-limiting illnesses. The needs of patients in palliative care include tratamentos to alleviate physical, emotional, spiritual and social suffering. In this scenario, it is important to think of new approaches that contemplate the complexity of care with the integration of other therapeutic models. Integrative and complementary practices present a dialogue with palliative care because they focus on the patient and not on the disease, address the physical, emotional, spiritual and environmental aspects involved in the illness; and place the patient and family at the center of the therapeutic relationship1. We report the experience of an interdisciplinary pediatric palliative care outpatient clinic that treats patients with difficult-to-control symptoms secondary to multifactorial causes. Working in an interdisciplinary manner, a doctor and a physiotherapist jointly develop a care plan and, through a multimodal approach2, pharmacological and non-pharmacological strategies are used to control symptoms by combining medications, physioterapia guidelines and Traditional Chinese Medicine techniques. Through interconsultations, patients are monitored by the psychology service. The outpatient clinic, opened in March 2023, is located in a federal university pediatric hospital that treats children with complex chronic conditions and disabilities. The purpose is to follow up patients who have been hospitalized at the institution or who are referred by other outpatient clinics. The main problems addressed are dor crônica, including neuropathic, somatic, and visceral pain; nausea, constipation, insomnia, ansiedade, and irritability. In addition to pharmacological management and physioterapia guidelines, patients receive tratamento based on Traditional Chinese Medicine. The main techniques used are Tuina, auriculoacupuntura, and Shonishin (Japanese pediatric acupuntura). Although we are in a hospital, a space very marked by Western medical rationality, we observed institutional support for the outpatient clinic. The use of integrative practices has been well received by families and patients, who recognize the benefits of combining other forms of tratamento in addition to pharmacological tratamento. The main challenges, in agreement with data in the literature3, are the team's recognition of the indications for follow-up in the outpatient clinic, lack of knowledge about the use of integrative practices in pediatrics, and coordination with other services in the institution that use integrative practices.

    "abstract": "The climacteric is a transitional period in a womans life, marked by the cessation of fertility and the onset of symptoms such as hot flashes, insomnia, mood swings, and musculoskeletal pain, all of which can significantly affect qualidade de vida. Menopausal Hormone Therapy (MHT) is an effective tratamento for alleviating these symptoms, but it is not suitable for all women due to contraindications and potential side effects. As a result, many women seek safer, accessible alternatives, with traditional, complementary, and integrative medicine approaches gaining popularity. Among these, yoga stands out as an ancient practice that promotes relaxation, reduces stress, and enhances overall well-being. In light of these benefits, the \"Yoga for Women in the Climacteric\" extension project was launched by the Federal University of Ouro Preto (UFOP) with the aim of providing yoga sessions to climacteric women in Ouro Preto and evaluating the effects of this practice on climacteric symptoms. The project began in 2015 and continues to evolve at UFOP. Participants are recruited through active outreach, including referrals from doctors, nurses, community health agents, and members of the research team, as well as direct invitations from friends and family of current participants. Yoga classes are held twice a week for sixty minutes, incorporating physical postures (asanas) to improve strength and flexibility, breathing exercises (pranayamas) to reduce ansiedade and enhance breathing patterns, and relaxation and meditação techniques to alleviate stress and promote better sleep. To assess the effects of yoga, we use the Kupperman Index (KI), which evaluates eleven common climacteric symptoms: hot flashes, paresthesia, insomnia, nervousness, depressão, dizziness, fatigue, joint/muscle pain, headache, palpitations, and tinnitus. Participants rate each symptom as absent, mild, moderate, or severe. The total score reflects the overall intensity of symptoms, with categories defined as mild (119), moderate (2035), and severe (above 35), based on a maximum score of 51 points. A score of zero indicates the absence of climacteric symptoms. Additionally, participants complete annual evaluation forms assessing their overall experience as very good, good, fair, or poor. Climacteric symptoms can severely impact womens qualidade de vida and are associated with an increased risk of developing chronic conditions such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, neuropsychiatric disorders, and osteoporosis. In addition, conventional tratamentos like Menopausal Hormone Therapy (MHT) are not suitable for everyone due to risks and contraindications. This creates a pressing need for safe, effective, and accessible non-pharmacological alternatives. To address this need, the Yoga for Women in the Climacteric project was initiated in 2015 at UFOP to offer yoga as a complementary terapia for this specific population. The initiative tackles the challenge of providing integrative health options within saúde pública settings, supported by partnerships with local health authorities who refer women to the program. Despite challenges such as limited instructor availability and adaptations during the COVID-19 pandemic, the project has successfully expanded access to yoga, aiming to improve symptom management and overall well-being in climacteric women. Outcomes of the project show a notable reduction in both the frequency and intensity of climacteric symptoms throughout the development of the initiative. After six months of yoga practice, the most pronounced improvements were seen in palpitations (12.3% decrease), fatigue (18.0% decrease), and nervousness (25.9% decrease). Other symptoms, such as hot flashes, headaches, insomnia, and paresthesia, also showed meaningful reductions, ranging from 3.4% to 10.1%. The severity of symptoms improved significantly, with the percentage of participants reporting moderate or severe symptoms dropping from 26.7% to just 3.3%. Additionally, the proportion of women with mild symptoms increased from 65.6% to 86.7%, while those with no symptoms rose from 6.7% to 8.9%. These results suggest a substantial enhancement in overall qualidade de vida among participants. The success of the project is also supported by a strong partnership with the local Health Department. Health professionals from public clinics frequently refer women to participate in the program. Due to the growing interest and the positive impact observed, efforts are currently underway to expand the number of classes and reach even more women in the community. The project has demonstrated that yoga can be a valuable tool in enhancing the qualidade de vida for women during the climacteric phase. High participant adherence reflects the significant acceptance of integrative practices, especially when provided in a supportive environment with active listening. The projects objectives were successfully achieved, leading to a noticeable positive impact on participants qualidade de vida. These resultados highlight the value of yoga as an effective complementary practice in womens health during this phase. It is recommended that public policies actively support the implementation and expansion of such practices. Moving forward, expanding the project to include more groups and fostering stronger institutional partnerships will be crucial for extending its benefits to a larger population.

    "abstract": "Keywords: Integrative Practices, Equity, Resolution, Desafios Introduction: Integrative and Complementary Health Practices (PICS) have been gaining ground in the Unified Health System (SUS) as strategies that promote comprehensive, person-centered care, valuing traditional knowledge and therapeutic approaches that increase the resoluteness of care. This article aims to outline the implementation profile of Integrative and Complementary Health Practices in the state of Paraná, identifying its main weaknesses and potentialities, in light of the principles of equity and resoluteness in care. The aim is also to discuss the challenges faced by managers and professionals in consolidating these practices within the scope of Primary Health Care. Descriptive study with a qualitativo approach, based on documentary review and analysis of secondary data available in the official systems of the Ministry of Health and the State Department of Health of Paraná.Regulations, ordinances and management reports that address the implementation and provision of PICS in the state were considered. The analysis was guided by the critical reading of documents and thematic categorization, with an emphasis on aspects related to equity, resoluteness, weaknesses and potential in the process of implementing practices. Conclusion: Despite the growing movement to value integrative practices, especially in Primary Care. However, in the state of Paraná, weaknesses persist related to professional training, financing, and regional inequalities that compromise equity in access. The resoluteness of actions is strongly associated with the articulation of PICS with other care strategies and the institutional recognition of these practices. Among the potentialities, the growing interest of professionals and the population stands out, in addition to the possibility of inserting PICS as strategic tools for promoção da saúde and humanization of care. Overcoming the challenges requires investment in effective public policies, continued training and integration of practices into the SUS care model. This article aims to outline the implementation of PICS in the state of Paraná, highlighting its main weaknesses and potentialities, based on the principles of equity and problem-solving capacity in care. It also seeks to discuss the challenges faced by managers and health professionals in consolidating these practices in the context of Primary Health Care. The research presents a descriptive character and qualitativo approach, based on documentary review and analysis of secondary data extracted from the official systems of the Ministry of Health and the State Health Department of Paraná. Regulations, ordinances and management reports related to the implementation and provision of PICS in the state were examined. The analysis was conducted based on a critical reading of the documents, with thematic categorization, emphasizing the aspects of equity, resolution, limitations and potential in the process of implementing these practices. Significant challenges persist, such as the lack of professional training, funding limitations and regional inequalities, which compromise the principle of equity. The efetividade of these actions is directly linked to the articulation of PICS with other care strategies and their institutional recognition. Among the positive points, we highlight the increased interest of both the population and health professionals, in addition to the potential of these practices as tools for promoting health and humanizing care. Facing these challenges requires strengthening public policies, offering continuing education and integrating PICS into the SUS care model. To strengthen the implementation of Integrative and Complementary Health Practices (PICS) in the state of Paraná and promote their consolidation in the Unified Health System (SUS), it is necessary to adopt a series of strategic actions that contemplate both the identified challenges and the observed potential. Strengthen professional training and qualifications  Invest in continuing education programs aimed at atenção primária professionals, focusing on PICS, ensuring technical qualifications and raising awareness of the importance of these practices in person-centered care. Increase funding and resources for PICS  Ensure adequate allocation of financial resources to enable the structuring of services, acquisition of materials and hiring of specialized professionals, especially in regions with less coverage. Reduce regional inequalities  Encourage public policies that promote territorial equity in the provision of PICS, focusing on areas of greater social vulnerability, through the decentralization of actions and technical-operational support to municipal administrations.Integrate PICS with other care strategies  Promote coordination between integrative practices and other services and programs of the Health Care Network, strengthening comprehensive care and promoting a more effective and humanized model. Strengthen the institutionalization of PICS  Ensure institutional recognition and support through clear regulations, inclusion of practices in health plans and systematic monitoring of implementation and results obtained. Promote social participation and community engagement  Stimulate the involvement of the population and health councils in the development and monitoring of actions aimed at PICS, valuing popular knowledge and promoting co-responsibility in care. Expand systematic research and evaluations  Invest in studies that assess the efetividade, impact and acceptance of PICS in different contexts of the SUS, providing support for the continuous improvement of the policies and practices adopted. These recommendations aim not only to overcome the obstacles currently faced, but also to enhance the benefits that PICS can offer, promoting more comprehensive, equitable care focused on the well-being of SUS users.",

    "abstract": "The Sophia Vercelli Institute (ISV) is a Civil Society Organization (CSO) founded in 2017, focused on the habilitation and rehabilitation of children with disabilities and support for their families. Grounded in a biopsychosocial view of disability, its mission is to include and care without barriers. The institute is located in Osasco (São Paulo, Brazil), a region characterized by high population density, social inequalities, and low family income. The project Creative Dialogues and Self-Care Practices was initiated by an atypical mother, founder of ISV, who recognized the importance of including herself within the care network. Motivated by the desire to share knowledge about the biopsychosocial view of disability with other mothers and caregivers, the proposal emerged. Arising from the need to care for the caregiver, Integrative Community Therapy (ICT) became the foundation of the project's central objective. This objective was structured by a pedagogical coordinator and certified trainer in ICT, which ensured that the approach was more inclusive and aligned with the biopsychosocial model of disability. ISV structures its program focused on family-centered practices. The project reaffirmed the fundamental role of family members and caregivers in the therapeutic development of children with disabilities, providing safe spaces for qualified listening and for the re-signification of pain and suffering. Through ICT circles, the project promoted emotional support, restored self-esteem, and stronger support networks. Over a period of 18 months, more than 600 ICT circles were held, totaling 7,241 individual attendances. Throughout the implementation, evaluation questionnaires, surveys, attendance lists, and other instruments were applied, enabling continuous monitoring of resultado indicators. From the listening processes conducted during the ICT circles, it was possible to identify the socio-emotional profile of the participants  predominantly mothers  as marked by caregiver invisibility, social isolation, emotional overload, paternal abandonment, lack of support, ableism and social judgment, and the erasure of the personal identity of caregiving mothers. This mapping corroborates existing studies on the reality of people with disabilities in Brazil, highlighting the central role of caregiving mothers in the inclusion process. The Brazilian Law for the Inclusion of Persons with Disabilities (Law No. 13,146/2015) recognizes people with disabilities as subjects of rights and assigns to the State, society, and the family the responsibility for ensuring these rights (Art. 8). Article 28 of the same law emphasizes the need for public policies that provide support to caregivers. The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, ratified by Brazil, reinforces this commitment (Art. 23). Studies such as Sólcia (2004) and data from IPEA (2017) indicate that approximately 85% of caregivers are women  mostly mothers  deeply involved in caregiving and rights advocacy. However, this role is marked by emotional overload, with high rates of depressão, ansiedade, social isolation (USP, 2021; ABRAz, 2019), and stress levels comparable to those experienced by soldiers in combat (Diament, 2009). Although the Brazilian Occupational Classification (CBO 5162) formally recognizes the caregiver profession, available support resources remain scarce. International research (University of Miami, 2018; Journal of Family Issues, 2019) also reveals intense psychological distress and suicidal ideation among these mothers. The Caregivers Practical Guide (2020) highlights contradictory feelings that often permeate their lived experience. In light of this reality, it is urgent to invest in public policies that acknowledge and support these women, ensuring dignified conditions for the exercise of their caregiving roles and positively impacting their families. The project had significant impacts: 80% of participants reported a reduction in feelings of loneliness and social isolation; 70% stated they received emotional support from other caregivers, discovered new emotional resources to cope with and care for their children's disabilities, and began to focus on their own potential. Additionally, 60% reported adopting self-care habits, improving communication skills, building support networks, learning to listen, to celebrate, to name their feelings, and to share knowledge and experiences within the disability rights agenda, alongside peers facing similar stories and challenges. The ICT circles proved to be fundamental in creating a sense of belonging, connecting participants with shared experiences and fostering empathy and solidarity networks. These bonds strengthened emotional resilience and contributed to reducing stress, suicidal thoughts, depressão, ansiedade, and feelings of isolation. Participants reported improvements in self-esteem, self-confidence, autonomy, and emotional self-regulation, with positive impacts on family and social relationships. Peer recognition helped restore a sense of identity, validating emotions and supporting a more assertive response to prejudice, reaffirming ICT as an effective socio-emotional technology. The acknowledgment and celebration of small achievements encouraged a more hopeful vision of the future, encouraging self-care and facilitating adaptation to daily challenges. The experience culminated in the creation of the worlds first Polo de Cuidado (Care Hub) specialized in the people with disabilities agenda, officially recognized by ABRATECOM. It also inspired the development of a municipal public policy (Call for Proposals No. 56/2024 by SEPCD-Osasco). Our main challenges were: (I) Ensuring ongoing training for facilitation teams, focusing on specialized listening and addressing ableism, considering participant profiles. (II) Deconstructing comparative patterns of suffering among caregivers, which weaken socio-emotional support networks. (III) Training the ability to read environments and people, with emphasis on nonverbal communication and emotional regulation. (IV) Addressing the difficulty of accessing ones own feelings, often suppressed due to the erasure of personal identity within the exclusive role of caregiver. (V) Overcoming resistance to sharing emotional struggles, marked by previous experiences of emotional invalidation and frustrations. (VI) Developing critical awareness to communicative coherence through constant reading of behavioral signals during their childrens crises. (VII) Suicidal thoughts, sometimes accompanied by attempts, are a recurring reality in the lives of many atypical mothers. As recommendations, we highlight the potential of ICT as an integrative approach that mediates socio-emotional changes, capable of redefining the experience of care and giving visibility to sufferings historically silenced. In this context, socio-emotional education is a strategic response to adversity, contributing to mitigating the impacts faced by families of people with disabilities. Initiatives such as this contribute to the construction of truly inclusive Planetary Health, One Health, and Well-Being Societies  which recognize, embrace, and value human diversity.",

For the extension workers, it was surprising to observe how such a simple practice could have such a profound impactthe simplicity of the sessions contrasted sharply with the depth of the effects observed. Complementary Therapies encompass complex medical systems and other therapeutic approaches that are now recognized within the Brazilian healthcare system and by the World Health Organization (WHO) as part of Traditional, Complementary, and Integrative Medicine. In Brazil, various Complementary Therapies approved by the National Policy on Integrative and Complementary Practices incorporate meditação and relaxation techniques. These approaches are based on the principle that \"any image firmly held in the mind is bound to manifest,\" suggesting that relaxation practices help individuals gain control over their mental imagery, leading to physical changes. According to the WHOs World Mental Health Report (2022), mental health has become a pressing issue due to its consequences, including psychological distress, abuse, disabilities, stigma, and human rights violations. Recognizing the benefits of Induced Relaxation (Carneiro, Caribé, and Rego, 2020) and understanding university extension programs as key mediators between academia and societal needs, UFPB launched the \"Induced Relaxation as a Health Strategy\" project. This report documents the experiences of extension workers during 2023 and 2024. The project served as a self-care health strategy, while also providing training for students and fostering research on integrative therapies. Participants included faculty, students, administrative staff, service providers, and the general public, totaling 356 individuals. Engagement occurred through individual and group sessions across UFPB campuses, as well as personal practice outside the acadêmico setting. Additional activities included: Regular posts on Instagram (@relaxamentoinduzidoufpb); distribution of informational pamphlets on campus; acadêmico presentations at scientific events; a related undergraduate thesis developed by a scholarship recipient; the relaxation sessions guided participants through simplified breathing techniques and body awareness exercises, lasting approximately 20 minutes, followed by group sharing. Key Experiences. Service Workers Group: Weekly sessions, though brief, were deeply meaningful; participants facing exhausting routines (often working through lunch breaks) found these moments to be a vital respite. Common remarks: \"This improves my day,\" \"I never miss a session,\" \"I wish this happened daily. Elderly Group (Paraíba Institute of Elderly, UFPB-affiliated): one-hour weekly sessions yielded significant feedback: \"It was excellent,\" \"I practice at homeit helps me sleep,\" \"Ill come every week,\" \"I wont miss it for anything,\" \"I felt completely at peace. Reflections from Extension Workers: surprise at the profound impact of a simple practice; recognition of individual differences: Some participants embraced relaxation quickly, while others required more time, highlighting the uniqueness of each persons response; professional growth: The experience reinforced the importance of empathetic listening, respect for individual journeys, and humanized healthcarevalues that will shape their future careers. This project underscored the transformative potential of relaxation practices in promoting mental and emotional well-being. It also demonstrated the role of university extension programs in bridging acadêmico knowledge and community health needs.",

    "abstract": "Background: Despite increasing interest among patients and healthcare professionals, baseado em evidence information on complementary and integrative medicine (CIM) remains rare on established medical knowledge platforms. Motivated by this gap, three doctoral students set out to explore how CIM could be more integrated into conventional medical education and clinical decision-making. Method: To address this, a collaboration was initiated with AMBOSS, German speaking leading digital platform for medical knowledge and exam preparation with approximately 440.000 users worldwide. The aim was to develop a learning module on CIM as part of the content for all medical exams, as 90% of German medical students use Amboss for exam preparation. Drawing on current scientific literature and clinical practice, the team wrote articles covering key CIM concepts and therapies for medical students and professionals. Results: The resulting content offers a structured and accessible overview of CIM, centred on the main principels of nature-based therapies, as well as selected traditional medical systems. Each section was revised by relevant experts in each respective field and includes baseado em evidence therapeutic recommendations. Conclusion: This project marks an important step toward closing the knowledge gap around complementary and integrative approaches in medical education. Establishing CIM in the learning environment of future physicians reduces prejudice and promotes a more open and informed attitude towards integrative care in clinical practice. As such this project paves the way for the integration of traditional and complementary medical approaches into the main body of conventional medical knowledge.",

    "abstract": "Contextual Descrição of the Area: The activity was held in Madureira, a neighborhood in Rio de Janeiro known for its strong cultural and emotional identity. The event took place at the Portela Samba School, a community landmark, which facilitated local engagement. The initiative was part of the extension project Paths to Well-Being, promoted by the School of Medicine at Faculdade Souza Marques. The goal was to offer integrative care practices focused on emotional health. The project consisted of one session per month over a six-month period, each lasting about one hour, with approximately 20-25 participants, one instructor, and one student mediator. Crystal terapia was chosen for one of these sessions to bridge popular and acadêmico knowledge through a circle of conversation and exchange of experiences Issues Addressed: A lack of community spaces dedicated to emotional care and therapeutic listening was observed in Madureira. Furthermore, medical education remains scarcely exposed to integrative practices. This activity aimed to address these gaps by fostering an environment for exchange between students and residents, where care was understood beyond technical approaches, highlighting the subjective dimensions of health. Results: Among participants, 71.4% reported introspection, 64.3% felt more connected to themselves, and 50% experienced a sense of peace. Emotional relief (42.9%), a sense of energetic balance and being welcomed (28.6%), improved self-esteem (14.3%), and a feeling of protection (14.3%) were also reported. Only 7.1% did not perceive significant effects. For the students, the experience was transformative: they reported practical learning, active listening, and increased sensitivity toward care. Recomendações: It is recommended that initiatives like this continue in areas with emotional and cultural vulnerability. Key challenges include the need for greater institutional recognition of integrative practices, training of qualified facilitators, and addressing prejudice toward alternative therapies in acadêmico settings.",

    "abstract": "The use of medicinal plants, while deeply embedded in traditional practices, is often accompanied by misinformation and unsafe use, aggravated by non-scientific content circulating in digital media. Furthermore, there is a certain conflict between traditional knowledge and biomedical knowledge, as many health professionals are still resistant to the use of medicinal plants, due to a lack of scientific evidence or fear of efeitos adversos, thus hindering the integration of knowledge. This university extension project addresses the promotion of safe and rational of medicinal plants practices through educational workshops that articulate traditional knowledge and scientific evidence. Focused on intoxication prevenção and sustainable use, the initiative empowers communities to harness the benefits of medicinal plants while mitigating health risks. We train participants in plant identification, safe preparation methods (teas, tinctures, ointments), dosage guidelines, contraindications, and interactions with conventional medications. Strengthen dialogue between traditional knowledge and scientific research to optimize therapeutic benefits, enhance flavors in culinary preparations (reducing salt/sugar use), promoting autonomy in self-healthcare management. Since 2018, interdisciplinary workshops have integrated hands-on activities, including: 1. Identification of safe species; 2. Practical sessions on preparation techniques; 3. Interactive discussions addressing myths vs. evidence; 4. Distribution of illustrated educational folders. Pre- and post-workshop questionnaires assess participants prior knowledge, usage patterns, and shifts in awareness regarding rational plant use. Workshops are held with groups of 12 to 20 participants, lasting 2 to 3 hours, fostering interaction among participants and personalized attention during practical activities. These workshops are organized around a brief theoretical and scientific foundation, followed by sensory or experimental practice (cultivation, preparation of teas, spices, or homemade herbal remedies); discussion groups or experience sharing. The average cost per workshop is R$200 to R$300. Evolving participant interests reflect changing health priorities: initial focus on gastrointestinal issues shifted to weight loss, ansiedade, and sleep improvement, with recent emphasis on womens health (e.g., perimenopause symptoms). Workshops adapt dynamically to these trends, featuring themes such as: - \"Lets Have Tea!\": Highlighting adequate preparation of common herbs (e.g., passionflower, chamomile, hibiscus, green tea); - Phytogastronomy: Demonstrating culinary uses of herbs for healthier diets; - Self-Care with Medicinal Plants for Womens Health: Emphasizing scientific names, indications, and segurança. Interactive games engage younger audiences, while tastings and printed guides reinforce learning. Below are two examples of participants who changed unsafe practices after participating in the workshops: Case A  A 65-year-old woman used a homemade mixture of street-picked boldo leaves with alcohol and camphor on her knees, unaware of the risks of picking plants from the street and their dubious identification. After the \"Safe Herbal Medicine for Chronic Pain\" workshop, she changed her use of an ointment based on copaiba oil and arnica, developed collectively during the workshop, with instructions on concentration, method of use, and contraindications. Case B  A 45-year-old man used to drink hibiscus tea daily for weight loss, but developed constipation. Change after the workshops safe identification and preparation of medicinal teas, he started using standardized dosages with a measuring spoon, and learned that hibiscus is made by infusion and not by decoction and improved his constipation, which he attributed to incorrect use, and higher concentration of tannins from the decoction he was making incorrectly. The challenges are multiple, including scarce financial resources, noncontinuous actions due to dependence on public notices or temporary partnerships. Despite occurring within an acadêmico framework, the project reveals persistent misinformation even among university populations. Workshops facilitate multilayered knowledge exchange, validating traditional practices while integrating scientific rigor. The initiative underscores importance of community education as a potent tool for promoção da saúde, blending cultural respect with baseado em evidence practices. Sustainability requires expanding medicinal gardens, training local multipliers, and fostering policy dialogue to scale impact.",

    "abstract": "The routine in Primary Health Care often involves complex demands from vulnerable families, which, combined with other factors, can cause frustration, stress, and emotional management difficulties that affect personal and professional relationships. With the integration of a Multidisciplinary Team (Equipe Multiprofissional - eMulti) working with teams at a Family Health Unit in Ribeirão Preto, state of São Paulo, we identified the need to support health professionals with moments of care, silence, and introspection. The challenges included work-related stress, ansiedade, insomnia, muscular and joint pains (especially in the feet, lower back, and cervical spine), and irritability. Due to these issues, professionals sought assistance from the eMulti for auriculoterapia at various times, often without proper organization for welcoming the requesting professional. Therefore, based on this demand, a weekly group was created, led by two eMulti professionals. The group has an open approach, allowing participants to join or leave over time without affecting the ongoing support. The focus of the group is to promote healthcare for professionals using two therapeutic approaches from Traditional, Complementary and Integrative Medicine (TCIM): group guided meditação and individual auriculoterapia performed before meditação. The goal is to strengthen individuals in a space of listening and support, fostering self-care. The group meets weekly for 30-minute sessions near lunchtime, aiming to minimize absence and encourage participation. Work overload, physical and psychosomatic pains, mental health issues such as stress and ansiedade. After three months, we applied the Perception of Change Scale - Patient Version (PCS-P) to the eight participants who attended at least 90% of the sessions. The qualitativo analysis showed that all reported improvements after starting participation, mentioning emotional control, more calm, and greater concentration. Of the 19 items on the PCS-P, 100% felt better than before in four areas: emotional stability, ability to handle difficult situations, sleep, and physical health. The item related to sexuality showed the highest number of participants with no change (62.5%), however, there were many reports of not having an active sex life at the moment. The others items saw at least 60% of participants perceiving improvements compared to their previous state. The intervenção demonstrated, both quantitatively and qualitativoly, a positive resultado, and we suggest expanding this practice within the service to allow more professionals to participate. Additionally, it can be replicated in other services that have mediating professionals who are willing and trained to carry out the offered TCIM approaches. The care proposal can be adapted by incorporating other therapeutic approaches, depending on the professional training and expertise in TCIM of the responsible team members.",

    "abstract": "Inspired by the World Health Organization (2019) report, which reviews more than 900 studies on the positive effects of arts on health, we present an experience in Chile: the incorporation of art and music terapia in a public pediatric hospital as part of the clinical and psychosocial approach to children and adolescents, and their caregivers. This initiative, developed at the Roberto del Río Children's Hospital, showed how art and music transform the hospital experience, promote therapeutic adherence, and foster emotional well-being, especially in vulnerable contexts. Children and adolescents treated, with ages between 2 to 18 years, referred from nutrition, rheumatology, nephrology, gastroenterology and rehabilitation departments, with predominant diagnoses being dor crônica, ansiedade disorders, eating disorders, autism spectrum disorder and depressão. This report describes two outpatient cases treated with art terapia and two inpatient cases accompanied by music terapia. Informed consent was obtained for all cases, safeguarding the confidentiality and identity of the patients. The intervençãos were carried out by therapists trained at the University of Chile, who designed individualized therapeutic processes tailored to each patient's physical and emotional state. Progress was monitored through clinical interviews and qualitativo reports submitted by caregivers and family members. The two outpatient cases received 60-minute art terapia sessions every two weeks, using pencils, watercolors, modeling clay, scraps, recycled objects, and symbolic elements. The first case, received 18 sessions, focused on facilitating emotional expression, promoting emotional regulation, and building a safe space for play, healing and support. The second case, received nine sessions, addressed aspects such as impulse control, symbolic grief processing and strengthening autonomy. Regarding the hospitalized cases, the music terapia sessions lasted 30 minutes weekly in a family setting, incorporating live instruments, voice, recordings, puppets, and multisensory resources. The first case, a patient in palliative care, nine sessions focused on accepting the diagnosis, supporting the farewell process, and strengthening the spiritual bond between mother, father and daughter. The second case, a patient undergoing cancer tratamento, received thirteen sessions aimed at strengthening healthy inner cores, reducing anticipatory ansiedade in the face of invasive procedures, and promoting emotional resilience in the patient and those around her. Among the main health issues today in our pediatric population are mental health disorders, nutrition disorders, dor crônica, autism spectrum disorder, children with special needs and palliative care, all of which produce emotional conditions that express through different diseases. Verbalizing these emotions is a challenge for adults but even more for children. Arts help them show and express what is happening inside themselves, making possible to offer different therapeutic strategies that help them cope with their emotions. In all four cases, children verbally and artistically expressed positive changes in their mental health and well-being. The first outpatient, stopped self-harm, urinary incontinence decreased, school motivation increased, and overall mood improvement was evident. The second case, aggressive behaviors decreased, family involvement increased, and a genuine desire to return to school emerged. The first hospitalized case, greater expressiveness, improved emotional regulation and moments of shared joy were observed during a terminal stage, achieving a deeply strengthened spiritual bond. The second case, anticipatory ansiedade decreased and greater family involvement in the therapeutic process was evident. Treatment adherence was high, as measured by both attendance and positive feedback from families. No adverse events were reported. International literature has extensively documented the benefits of art therapies in pediatric hospital settings. Fancourt and Finn (2019) highlight their efetividade in reducing physical and emotional symptoms, facilitating therapeutic bonding, and humanizing medical care. Our experience confirms these findings in a highly complex clinical and social setting, where art has served as a bridge between the biomedical approach and human dimensions of care. Art therapies offered children and adolescents a symbolic, corporeal and emotional space to express what was difficult for them to express in words. Among the program's limitations are the lack of quantitative systematization, the initial lack of knowledge from clinical teams, and the precarious structure, which was sustained through volunteer work without stable funding. Despite this, the results observed in patients and their families reveal the profound potential of these disciplines to be integrated into the Chilean saúde pública system. Art therapies not only complement conventional medical tratamento, but also transform it. They redefine the experience of hospitalization, opening avenues for expression, play, support, and meaning-making and strengthening the essential bonds that sustain the healing process. Arts were particularly important for expressing complex emotions and feelings that cannot be easily verbalized. In pediatric settings, their impact is integrative and deeply human.",

    "abstract": "The Antiprotocol is an innovative management strategy developed in Campinas, Brazil (between 2002 and 2005) aimed at transforming how health services are planned and delivered within atenção primária. Unlike traditional clinical protocols  which are typically designed by specialists and focus on standardizing responses to specific diseases  the Antiprotocol seeks to decentralize decision-making, promoting a participatory model that values professional autonomy and local specificity. This strategy emerged as part of a broader effort to humanize healthcare into the Public Health System (SUS). Its implementation involved the formation of multidisciplinary working groups, composed of professionals from different areas of knowledge within primary healthcare (PHC). , who collaborated to develop flexible frameworks for addressing common health issues such as smoking cessation, arterial hypertension and diabetes. Through dialogue, the group reaches a consensusafter listening to and evaluating the diverse experiences in addressing a given health problemon the most appropriate indicators to assess the resultados of health intervençãos, as well as on which actions should be included as possible recommendations for atenção primária teams to address the problem. Each team will then select health intervençãos that best match their competencies and the profile of the population they serve. Importantly, the Antiprotocol framework is supported by three core guiding principles: 1. Indicators and monitoring tools: Teams are encouraged to estimate the number of individuals affected by a given condition, map existing actions, and define resultado indicators to assess the impact of intervençãos. 2. Expanded clinical guidelines: These emphasize a broader concept of health, recognizing the importance of patient autonomy, affective dimensions, social determinants of health, and the role of knowledge and power in interpersonal and social relationships. 3. Therapeutic menu: Each Antiprotocol provides a diversified list of intervençãos tailored to the specific topic, enabling PHC teams to choose the most appropriate options based on local realities. Despite its potential, the current model of primary healthcare in many saúde pública systems remains heavily influenced by rigid, disease-centered clinical protocols. These protocols are often developed by specialists and prioritize biological dimensions of illness, frequently overlooking psychosocial, cultural, and environmental factors that significantly influence health resultados. As a result, PHC professionals face several challenges: - Limited autonomy: Clinical decisions are frequently dictated by top-down guidelines that do not account for the complexity of individual or community-specific contexts. - Standardization of care: Protocols tend to homogenize tratamento approaches, reducing the ability of health teams to respond creatively and effectively to diverse health needs. - Marginalization of integrative practices: Many effective complementary and traditional health practices remain excluded from mainstream care due to institutional biases toward biomedicine. - Disconnection from local realities: Centralized planning often fails to consider the unique sociocultural and epidemiological profiles of different communities, limiting the relevance and efetividade of intervençãos. These limitations hinder the capacity of PHC to fulfill its foundational role as the central point of access, continuity, and comprehensiveness in health systems. In this context, the Antiprotocol emerges as a strategic response to these systemic shortcomings, offering a new way to structure and manage care delivery. The implementation of the Antiprotocol has yielded several important resultados: Firstly, the strategy has successfully promoted multiprofessional collaboration, bringing together professionals with diverse backgrounds to co-create solutions. Secondly, the inclusion of integrative and complementary practices has expanded the therapeutic repertoire available to PHC teams, aligning with the preventive and holistic orientation of atenção primária. For example, the Antiprotocol for smoking cessation incorporated auriculoterapia and acupuntura, while the one for hypertension included homeopathic and traditional Chinese medicine approaches. Notably, each Family Health Team selects its actions from a curated set of possible and contextually appropriate options listed in the Antiprotocol. These available options are not arbitrarythey are based on accumulated experiences within the municipal health network and shaped by consensus among participants working on each specific theme. Thirdly, by encouraging teams to define their own indicators and evaluate resultados, the Antiprotocol has strengthened monitoring and accountability mechanisms, ensuring that flexibility does not come at the cost of quality or coherence. Finally, the strategy has contributed to a more democratic and pluralistic health management culture, empowering teams to make decisions based on local knowledge and community needs rather than external mandates. Based on the findings from the Antiprotocol experience in Campinas, several recommendations can be made for other municipalities or health systems seeking to promote organizational democratization and integrate complementary practices into atenção primária: 1. Encourage the formation of multidisciplinary working groups involving frontline health workers in the development of clinical and managerial strategies. This enhances ownership, creativity, and contextual relevance. 2. Encourage professionals involved in the Antiprotocol to share their experiences and knowledge with other atenção primária team members, either by welcoming colleagues for observation or by presenting practice-based reports in other PHC settings. This includes fostering spaces where professionals are open to receiving individuals interested in learning about these practices, thus promoting a dynamic exchange of knowledge within primary healthcare scenarios. 3. Develop adaptable frameworks rather than rigid protocols: adopt flexible \"menus\" of intervençãos, allowing teams to select the most appropriate actions based on local needs and resources. 4. Recognize the importance of social determinants, identify public policies that contribute to health inequities, and support community organization in advocating for more equitable public policies. 5. Strengthen monitoring and evaluation mechanisms: Equip teams with tools to track progress and assess the impact of intervençãos, ensuring that innovation is grounded in accountable to the population served. 6. Promote policy alignment and institutional support: Ensure that regulatory and administrative structures support the integration of complementary practices and participatory management approaches within the health system. 7. Encourage research and dissemination: Support acadêmico studies and knowledge-sharing initiatives to document best practices and facilitate replication in other settings. In conclusion, the Antiprotocol represents a transformative approach to atenção primária management that prioritizes participation, pluralism, and responsiveness. It offers a valuable model for rethinking how health services are organized and delivered, especially in complex and diverse health systems where flexibility and inclusivity are essential for achieving equitable and sustainable resultados.",

    "abstract": "The community outreach project Tai Chi Chuan: Health and Well-being is conducted in Ouro Preto, a historic Brazilian city recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Supported by the Federal University of Ouro Preto (UFOP), the initiative offers free, open-access activities to local residents. Tai Chi Chuan is a traditional Chinese martial art widely recognized for its combined physical and mental health benefits. By integrating intentional movement, breathing techniques, and mental focus, it promotes a holistic approach to disease prevenção, physical rehabilitation, and emotional well-being. The project aims to enhance physical, mental, and emotional health through regular Tai Chi Chuan practice, emphasizing the value of integrative and complementary health approaches. It also seeks to broaden community access to traditional knowledge, encourage self-care, foster intergenerational socialization, and support the creation of collective spaces for promoção da saúde and disease prevençãoparticularly among adults and older individuals. To support these goals, the project currently offers two weekly classes featuring movements such as Qi Gong Ba Duan Jin and the simplified Yang-style Tai Chi form. These sessions provide a consistent and inclusive environment for community engagement in health-related activities. Open to all individuals aged 18 and over, participation requires no prior registration or experience. In addition to physical practice, the project hosts monthly educational meetings known as Yum Cha, inspired by Chinese cultural traditions. These gatherings present the health benefits of Tai Chi in accessible language, supported by current scientific evidence. They also offer a welcoming space for participants to share experiences and build collective knowledge. In the spirit of community, each meeting includes tea and shared snacks brought by participants, creating a warm, coffee-break atmosphere that fosters social bonds and mutual care. The community outreach project \"Tai Chi Chuan: Health and Well-being\" tackles several challenges faced by the population of Ouro Preto, including limited access to holistic health practices such as Tai Chi Chuan and Qi Gong within local healthcare and community settings. Many residents, especially older adults, face barriers such as geographic isolation, financial constraints, and a lack of awareness regarding these integrative practices. By offering free, accessible classes, the project bridges the gap between conventional healthcare and alternative approaches, promoting physical and mental health. Through regular practice, it supports disease prevenção, physical rehabilitation, and emotional well-being, fostering a more inclusive and comprehensive approach to wellness within the community. Since its inception in 2023, the project has welcomed 105 participants aged 19 to 74 years. In its first year, the majority of participants (51.7%) were between 18 and 39 years old, reflecting a strong presence of individuals from the acadêmico community. By 2024, however, this demographic profile shifted significantly, with 65% of participants aged 50 or older, indicating that the projects growing visibility and outreach effectively expanded its reach within the broader Ouro Preto population. The participant profile also reveals a notable gender distribution: women accounted for 63.3% of attendees who participated in at least one session in 2024. This majority aligns with national trends showing greater female engagement in integrative and community health initiatives. To assess the perceived benefits of Tai Chi practice, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 21 voluntary participants. The most frequently reported resultados included improved balance, coordination, and physical vitality, along with enhanced breathing, sleep quality, and reduced ansiedade. Furthermore, 90% of participants rated the overall quality of the project as 10 out of 10, reflecting high satisfaction with the intervenção. During the monthly Yum Cha sessions, participants share benefits they have experienced in daily life, fostering a collective exchange of knowledge. These meetings also serve as an accessible platform for scientific communication with the local population, reinforcing the projects commitment to education, dialogue, and the promotion of integrative health. The project has also contributed to the broader health community. Notably, it participated in health-related congresses such as the Microrregional Meeting on Integrative and Complementary Health Practices held in Ouro Preto, attended by saúde pública professionals seeking to expand their knowledge of integrative approaches. In 2024, eleven project participants represented the group at the International Chin Woo Chinese Martial Arts Championship in Mariana. The group achieved remarkable success, winning twelve medals across Traditional Tai Chi Chuan and Shaolin Kung Fu categories, and securing 3rd place for the highest number of participants. Furthermore, the project organized two self-defense classes tailored specifically for women and the LGBTQIAPN+ community, grounded in martial arts principles. This initiative was conducted in partnership with Andorinhas, a womens group from UFOP, and OBSCENO, an outreach project supporting the extranormative community of Ouro Preto. The project demonstrates that Tai Chi Chuan can serve as a valuable tool in saúde pública initiatives, particularly when offered in accessible and inclusive community settings. For future development, expanding the program to additional neighborhoods and integrating it with primary healthcare services is recommended. Key challenges include the need to train more instructors and secure sustained funding to ensure the programs long-term sustainability and wider impact. Acknowledgments: UFOP and FAPEMIG.",

    "abstract": "This report is part of a research project developed at PUC-SP, based on the principle of mind-body integration. It investigates the effects of Calatonia, a subtle touch technique created by Hungarian physician Pethö Sándor, on students reporting high levels of psychological suffering. The technique consists of subtle touches on the sole of the foot, nape, heel, and tendinous convergence of the triceps surae. These touches have a muscular relaxation effect (Arcuri, 2009), since these areas are provided with different dermomechanical characteristics that include neuronal integration of the field of affect and cognition (Blanchard, 2021). Sándor observed in his patients who went through the relaxation technique a homeostatic reorganization, such as changes in body temperature and breathing (Blanchard, 2022). Furthermore, he noticed that his patients began to share stories, feelings, and thoughts more spontaneously (Blanchard, 2022). These therapeutic effectsnot only physical but also psychologicalwere the foundation of this research. For this study, the DASS-21 (Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale  21 items) was used to classify participants´ scores in each of the three subcategories of symptoms. It was stablished that participants who´s score was classified as Severe or Extremely Severe in any of the described subescales- a total of five- were the ones selected for the Calatonia intervenção. Empirically, it is known that this technique has specially relaxing effects in cases of extreme stress, and that it´s effect wouldn´t be as significant in lower symptom level´s cases. The application of Calatonia took a total of ten sessions for each participant, and we got the help of three volunteer applicators. According to the DASS-21, 68% of participants' scores were classified as Severe or Extremely Severe in at least one categoryand 38% had this worrying type of classification in all three types of symptomatology. Additionally, the sociodemographic questionnaire showed that all participants reported feeling stressed. When it comes to the correlation between mental suffering and the body it is important to emphasize how Anxiety, for example, is a disorder that has atypical bodily manifestations such as wide eyes and unsettled stomach (Freeman, 2015) . These physiological changes are related to the Central Nervous System and can be considered result of the Psychophysical Integration. The body of literature addressed in this study indicates a concerning scenario regarding this kind of symptomatology among university students after the COVID-19 pandemic. It is important to mention that, among psychology students, there is intense exposure to situations of extreme suffering and vulnerability. This exposure, though acadêmicoally and professionally inevitable, can lead to a worsening of stress symptomatology when not properly addressed. According to Abreu (2021), there are numerous studies on the impact of stressors such as pain, suffering, and grief among medical students, for example, but not many mention psychology studentseven though this group also deals with experiences of loss, significant emotional pain, and frequent social vulnerability. These phenomena highlight the relevance of this research. All five participants reported feeling relaxed during the Calatonia sessions, a reaction to the intervenção also noted by the applicators. According to Blanchard (2022), the ergotropic state (deep relaxation) promotes an ideal internal condition for physiological balance and well-being. The author also notes that spasms and eyelid twitching are the kinds of responses that indicate this relaxation response, as well as the possibility of energy reposition and, consequently, greater organism stability. Both bodily responses were observed by the applicators. Regarding the post-Calatonia DASS-21 results, the Stress average showed the most significant difference. The participants' average score, previously classified as Severe (26.2 points), was reduced by 20.2 points, reaching 6.0a score classified as Normal. As for Anxiety levels, although there was no statistically significant reduction, it is possible to observe a meaningful change: the average score decreased from 16.4 to 6.0, which also corresponds to a Normal classification on this subscalea reduction of 10.4 points. In the case of Depression, there was a statistically significant reduction: the average score dropped from 26.2 (Severe classification) to 8.0, a score considered Normalan 18.2-point reduction. The initial hypothesisthat Calatonia would be more effective in cases classified as Severe or Extremely Severewas confirmed, as well as the literature that points to subtle touch as a technique capable of producing therapeutic results. The fact that Calatonia was applied without verbal terapia in this research suggests that the technique alone can be effective in reducing symptoms of stress and depressão. However, it is plausible that, if combined with verbal psychoterapia, the resultados could be even more promising. To strengthen the findings of this study, future research should include a broader sample of participants.",

    "abstract": "Since 2023, an intercultural health project has been implemented, articulating ancestral Mapuche medicine from the Pewenche territory of Icalma (Araucanía Region, Chile) with Western mental health. This project seeks to build bridges of dialogue and collaborative work, allowing different and complementary perspectives to converge for a joint approach to mental health. Mapuche medicine understands that emotional and mental symptoms precede physical illnesses, so it is a medicine that has a preventive meaning in health, as it works before the manifested imbalance spreads to the body and establishes itself as a physical illness. Bringing this medicine to Western mental health spaces has allowed Mapuche and non-Mapuche people to access healing processes that go beyond symptom relief, with a spiritual focus, in a process whose ultimate purpose is the reconnection of the person with their spirit, allowing them to inhabit the transcendent dimension. During 2024, 19 people from Santiago were treated in a coordinated effort between psychiatry, psychology, and Mapuche medicine. Health care was provided both in a mental health center in Santiago city and in Icalma town, in the ruka of the machi and the lawenche (Mapuche spiritual healers). Mapuche medicine is a medicine of the land, which the Machi and Lawenche perform with earth elements, which connect with spirituality. For this reason, an important part of the tratamentos are ceremonies held in the machi's territory, involving the patient's family, as well as the machi's community. Cases are addressed through patient referrals, coordinating successive intervençãos in psychology, psychiatry, and Mapuche medicine, according to requirements. Case follow-up is carried out through meetings where diverse perspectives converge. We worked together to comprehensively systematize three cases that have shown significant progress and have been discharged: A 27-year-old patient diagnosed with endogenous depressão A 16-year-old patient diagnosed with autism and obsessive-compulsive disorder A 13-year-old patient diagnosed with psychosis Chile faces a significant demand for mental health, and conventional tratamentos are limited in providing real healing for people's conflicts, expressed in a set of symptoms that constitute the so-called mental health disorders. Mapuche medicine is a spiritual and a land medicine, with a system of ancestral knowledge for the diagnosis and tratamento of illnesses and for achieving a person's well-being, not just symptom relief. This medicine understands that no one heals alone, so it incorporates the family and community dimension into concrete practices. We all need to feel supported by the bonds we are part of. This knowledge broadens the view of Western mental health, providing an order of energy and lineages and supporting profound processes that allow the healing of individuals and the reconnection with life force and spirit. Primarily, we built a collaborative model that integrated mental health and ancestral Mapuche medicine. This model has enabled dialogue between disciplines and knowledge, including spirituality and the ancestral perspective on conflicts expressed in mental-emotional and spiritual symptoms in people. Recognizing and defining the areas of expertise for each practice and generating spaces for coordination, has allowed for the co-construction of diagnoses that complement the perspectives of psychiatry, psychology, and Mapuche medicine. The tratamentos were ordered and complemented as follows: psychological, for emotional and mental aspects; psychiatric management, for invasive and debilitating symptoms; and with Mapuche medicine working on the energetic and spiritual aspects, including ancestry for the ordering of lineages and allowing people to return to their roots and essential strength. Follow-up of the intervençãos was done through monthly clinical meetings, that allowed us to examine the entire tratamento process, exchange perspectives, and understand that we are all looking at the same person from different perspectives and understandings. This has given rise to new understandings, since the process of restoring emotional, mental, and spiritual balance in a person is a complex process that requires various intervençãos, where family support is a determining factor in sustaining tratamento. We would like to incorporate other mental health professionals who are currently undergoing tratamento with Mapuche medicine, as direct experience allows us to understand its depth and it´s contributions to mental health work. We seek to make the tratamentos sustainable, so that Mapuche and non-Mapuche people, from different territories and without financial resources, can access, sustain the tratamentos and receive the different forms of care that Mapuche ancestral medicine involves. This approach works from the individual to the family and community, requiring multiple actions and actors. The tratamentos can last several months or even a year, and involve various ceremonies and tratamento techniques that require the participation of numerous people, which entails high costs, often unaffordable for many families. Because this is a medicine deeply connected to the land, it is urgently necessary to have cultivation sites for plants, herbs, and trees used in the tratamentos.",

    "abstract": "The experience was carried out within the scope of the Positive Mental Health course, offered to master's and doctoral students of the Graduate Program in Collective Health at UFES during the second semester of 2024, with the participation of 15 students. As part of the course, a welcoming space was created to integrate the Decalogue of Positive Mental Health through the use of Integrative and Complementary Health Practices (PICS). The course was based on the Multifactorial Model of Positive Mental Health (MMSM+), initially proposed by Jahoda (1958) and later expanded by Lluch-Canut (1999), along with the Decalogue proposed by Lluch (2020). The MMSM+ defines Positive Mental Health (PMH) as a construct resulting from a combination of personal and psychosocial resources. It is a dynamic and fluctuating state that encompasses both positive and negative feelings, thoughts, and behaviors, enabling individuals to feel and function at their best within their particular life circumstances (LLUCH, 2020). The six factors that compose the PMH model are: Personal Satisfaction, Prosocial Attitude, Self-Control, Autonomy, Problem Solving, and Interpersonal Relationship Skills. The Decalogue of Positive Mental Health consists of the following ten recommendations: 1. Value the positive aspects of life, both personal and professional; 2. Carry out daily activities with dedication and affection; 3. Avoid overly rigid self-judgment or judgment of others, cultivating tolerance, understanding, and flexibility; 4. Do not let negative emotions hinder personal development; 5. Be aware of and appreciate good moments as they happen; 6. Allow yourself to experience and express emotions, understanding that different feelings are normal (do not fear crying or feeling); 7. Seek spaces and activities that promote mental relaxation; 8. Face problems as they arise, adopting an active stance toward adversity; 9. Nurture interpersonal relationships both in personal and professional spheres; 10. Use humor frequently as a coping strategy and a way to promote well-being. To plan, implement, and evaluate the activities that articulated PICS with the ten recommendations of the Decalogue, the following actions were taken: a critical review of the Decalogue and of baseado em evidence strategies from the Mentis Plus+ program for promoting positive mental health; welcoming activities linked to the experience of a specific PICS; and the use of a Positive Mental Health Journal, in which students were invited to record their thoughts, experiences, and resources related to the Decalogue. It is important to highlight that since the approval of the National Policy on Integrative and Complementary Practices (PNPIC) in 2006 (Ordinance GM/MS No. 971), these practices have gained visibility and expanded. In 2017, Ordinance GM/MS No. 849 increased the number of PICS modalities to 19, including art terapia, Ayurveda, meditação, and yoga, among others. In 2018, Ordinance GM/MS No. 702 added ten more practices, totaling 29 PICS offered through the Brazilian Unified Health System (SUS). In the Positive Mental Health course, the following PICS were used: meditação, Reiki, Liang Gong, Integrative Community Therapy, aromaterapia, auriculoterapia, and circular dance. At the end of the course, these experiences were shared in a collective moment of reflection on what was lived and learned throughout the course. While access to and permanence in higher education are considered major achievements, the acadêmico journey also brings significant physical, socioeconomic, cultural, and emotional challenges that may affect students mental health in different ways (Costa & Moreira, 2016; Gomes LMLDS et al., 2023). In recent decades, concern with university students mental health has become increasingly prominent in higher education and saúde pública policies (UNESCO, 2021; WHO, 2022). In this context, the presented strategy incorporates integrative practices and the study of positive mental health as a means to promote well-being among graduate students. The experience of using integrative practices alongside the study of positive mental health to promote well-being among graduate students yielded the following results:  100% of students were able to engage in personal self-assessment through the Positive Mental Health Journal;  Participants acknowledged the potential of PICS to promote positive mental health, as highlighted throughout the course;  91% of participants reported that the course significantly contributed to their development in terms of self-care and well-being, while the remainder evaluated the contribution as moderate. In light of the Multifactorial Model of Positive Mental Health (MMSM+), it was observed that the integration of PICS with the Decalogue helped to strengthen the six core factors of the model. This experience showed that integrating Integrative and Complementary Health Practices (PICS) with the Decalogue of Positive Mental Health strengthens graduate students' self-care and well-being. Therefore, it is recommended to maintain and expand such initiatives, both within the university community and among professionals working in the Brazilian Unified Health System (SUS). It is essential to invest in faculty training and to encourage interdisciplinary research on this subject. Linking these initiatives to institutional policies on mental health and student support reinforces their sustainability.",

    "abstract": "The integration of TCIM in PHC settings has proven to be a powerful tool to enhance care quality and broaden clinical perspectives of health professionals in training. In Brazil, the National Policy on Integrative and Complementary Practices in Health (PNPIC) has supported the inclusion of such practices since 2006, although implementation remains uneven (BRASIL, 2018). This experience took place at a Family Health Clinic located in a central and densely populated area of Rio de Janeiro, marked by social vulnerability and high demand for mental health and pain-related care. The outpatient clinic was implemented in November 2024 by a physician preceptor of the Family and Community Medicine Residency Program (SMS-RJ), with formal training in TCM from the Fluminense Federal University (UFF) and certified as an instructor in the Acupuncture for Primary Care Physicians course (AMAB), promoted by UFSC and the Brazilian Ministry of Health (UNIVERSIDADE FEDERAL DE SANTA CATARINA, 2024). The team included medical residents and multiprofessional residents in nursing, physioterapia, and physical education. The service provided acupuntura, auriculoterapia, moxibustion, and cupping terapia weekly, with each shift structured to receive up to three users. Sessions included shared anamnesis, clinical reasoning, and supervised therapeutic procedures. Patients with musculoskeletal pain were also referred to existing physical activity programs and therapeutic groups (for cervical, lumbar, shoulder, and knee pain) within the PHC unit. Primary Health Care (PHC) faces high demand for chronic conditions such as pain, insomnia, ansiedade, and headaches. The conventional response, often centered on medicalization, fails to address the subjective and social dimensions of illness. The lack of structured spaces for the teaching and practice of Traditional, Complementary, and Integrative Medicine (TCIM) also hampers its application by professionals in training. Given this challenge, the team was able to schedule only three assessments per week. Although Brazils National Curriculum Guidelines call for comprehensive and humanized medical education (BRASIL, 2014), TCIM practices still occupy a marginal place in medical curricula, often addressed as elective topics without real integration into clinical practice. Furthermore, the integration of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) into conventional healthcare still faces obstacles such as the scarcity of robust scientific evidence, institutional resistance, regulatory barriers, and a lack of standardized professional training (WHO, 2023; MAYO CLINIC, 2024; UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA, 2024). Another barrier encountered was managing follow-up appointments, as TCM care may require 8 to 10 follow-up visits depending on the chronicity of the patients condition. To address this issue, the preceptorwho also served as the support supervisor for the residency programchose to use the TCIM outpatient clinic schedule exclusively for initial evaluations, during which the therapeutic plan would be defined in collaboration with the patient, Family and Community Medicine residents, and the interprofessional team. It was then established that follow-up visits would be conducted by the residents themselves during the scheduled care shifts of the Family Health Team. To ensure autonomy and segurança, the preceptor remained available to observe and discuss the follow-up visits within all family health teams. This strategy proved effective in expanding access to TCIM consultations in the health unit and in multiplying knowledge and familiarity with these practices. This initiative demonstrated the pedagogical and clinical value of TCIM in PHC training environments. The outpatient clinic enhanced clinical reasoning, active listening, and a person-centered approach. The collaborative practice with multiprofessional residents fostered comprehensive therapeutic planning (FEUERWERKER; SENA, 2002). Practical-theoretical training and supervised clinical activity promoted situated learning, rooted in real-life contexts and local health needs. Users reported symptomatic relief and feeling welcomed and cared for. As a result, a new training program for nurses in Programmatic Area 1.0 is being developed in partnership with the TCIM Coordination Office of SMS-RJ to expand and sustain integrative care. It is recommended that similar outpatient clinics be implemented in other PHC units, ensuring proper training, supervision, and integration with local networks. Strategic professionals such as nurses and multiprofessional teams should be targeted for training to ensure capillarity and sustainability. The consolidation of TCIM in health education demands investment in research, clear regulation, and institutional support (WHO, 2023; BRASIL, 2018).",

    "abstract": "Universidad San Francisco de Quito USFQ, is a private non-profit acadêmico institution ranked by the World University Rankings as #1 in Ecuador and #55 in Latin America (https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/2023/latin-america-university-rankings/), and the only institution in Ecuador based on the philosophy of Liberal Arts, shapes free, creative, and entrepreneurial professionals. This institution is always open to developing innovative and challenging acadêmico programs to fulfill the unmet requirements of professionals already working, particularly through its School of Medicine, where there are a lot of postgraduate courses and diploma certifications available. In particular, we identified that integrative medicine is still an underdeveloped area in LMIC like Ecuador, where there is an important divergence between homeopatia and occidental medicine, although traditional (ancestral medicine) is well recognized, even by the constitutional law. After a profound analysis of the acadêmico offer in Ecuador, we concluded that the main reason for that divergence is the lack of formal acadêmico programs where physicians interested in integrative medicine might be trained and certified. Therefore, based on the current programs offered by other institutions in the region, we developed a challenging but concrete curriculum to cover all aspects of integrative medicine, from the basic concept up to the clinical practice. It was a hybrid program composed of ten modules to accomplish a total of 108 hours over six months. Those ten modules were covered by 30 instructors, most of them with an international qualification and years of experience. After almost two years of preparation, we were able to launch our \"Diploma training course in integrative medicine\", which was adopted by 40 physicians all around the country. It was a very interesting experience because every session, the participation was increasing, and the exchange of experiences and criteria was enriching the knowledge acquisition by the participants. Although some of the sessions were exhausting, no participant declined during their conduct. Periodical examinations were also applied to warranty that participants were compromised with the acadêmico standard required by the university. Finally, 36 of those initial participants approved the program and got their qualification. After this initial successful experience, we are convinced that it was a good idea to launch this program and will continue on a routine basis offering it. Surely will be necessary to review the faculty list and the length of the topic analyzed, as well as to increase the practical activities to maximize the improvement of technical skills by the participants.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT The current Brazilian social and political context, marked by multiple saúde pública crises, the experience of a pandemic, and the psychosocial effects of isolation, discrimination, and loneliness, has accentuated the populations physical and emotional distress. In this context, individual-based health responses are insufficient for coping with the complexity of collective suffering. While the clinical-hegemonic model falls short, collective care presents itself as a possible path, though professionals often lack preparation to act within this model. Integrative Community Therapy (ICT/TCI) is a recognized psychosocial practice by the Ministry of Health, carried out through therapeutic circles in open spaces, aimed at building social support networks that promote life, strengthen resilience, and mobilize individual, family, and community resources. It is not psychoterapia, but a therapeutic act that can be applied in various contexts and stages of life. It is based on community knowledge and supports the strengthening of social bonds, emotional support, the sharing of life experiences, and the reduction of social isolation. Since 2017, ICT/TCI has been included in the National Policy for Integrative and Complementary Practices (PNPIC) of the Unified Health System (SUS). It is a transversal policy across all levels of care, with a strong presence in Primary Health Care (PHC), and integrates a set of therapeutic resources for disease prevenção, promoção da saúde, and recovery. ICT offers a safe and open space for the exchange of knowledge and experiences, fostering bonds, autonomy, and the transformation of vulnerability into power. It strengthens community resilience, enables new meanings for pain, crises, and losses, and celebrates growth and victories. Given this context, we developed a training course and structured a training center. It is the first officially recognized ICT Training Center operating within the SUS and funded by it. Created by the Municipality of Campinas, the training model is unprecedented and enables the sustainability, replication, and scaling of this care strategy as a public policy. DESCRIPTION This is a training course for employees of the Municipal Health Department (and potentially in the future, from other departments such as Education) in Integrative Community Therapy, with a total workload of 240 hours. This includes theoretical content, supervised practice of therapeutic circles at the beginning of the course, and experiential activities aimed at preparing, caring for, and transforming these public workers. Theoretical pillars of ICT, ICT Circles, Experiential Activities, Supervisions. RESULTS Two groups of Integrative Community Therapists were trained between 2023 and 2025. The first group had 26 students, and the second had 34  all employees of the Campinas Municipal Health Department. It is worth noting that in the selection of course candidates, the main criterion recommended to managers was the suitability of the candidates profile for this kind of collective care. Preference was given to professionals in direct contact with the community. A university degree was not required, giving prominence to Community Health Workers and Nursing Technicians, alongside Psychologists, Occupational Therapists, Nurses, and other professionals with higher education. All participants committed to replicating the therapeutic circles in their communities, which has already been happening in a significant and impactful way. Due to logistical considerations, we are considering adopting a hybrid format (in-person and online) for future courses. REFERENCES BARRETO, Adalberto de Paula.

    "abstract": "SUMMARY: The municipality of Campinas, known for its strong saúde pública tradition and commitment to social participation, has advanced the implementation of Integrative and Complementary Practices in Health (PICS) by establishing a Training Center for Integrative Community Therapy (ICT) within the local Unified Health System (SUS). ICT is a practice officially recognized by the National Policy on Integrative and Complementary Practices (PNPIC). After a period of reduced ICT practice circles due to staff changes, the post-pandemic context brought new challenges and opportunities. Between 2021 and 2022, the arrival of new professionals trained in ICT and the need to address the emotional distress of the population fostered the revival and strengthening of this practice and the creation of a certified training center. DESCRIPTION: Campinas is home to a population of 1,139,047 people¹. In the 1970s, the city stood out as a pioneer in expanding the basic healthcare network. Currently, the Municipal Health Department (SMS) is organized into six health districts and operates an extensive Primary Health Care network, consisting of 69 Basic Health Units (UBSs) under the Family Health Strategy model. This network is supported by Multiprofessional Teams in Primary Care (eMulti)², Psychosocial Care Centers (CAPS), and Home Care Services³. In 2001, the Body in Movement Project was launched, focusing on a user-centered care model. With the implementation of the National Policy on Integrative and Complementary Practices in the SUS (PNPIC), several practices and methods were incorporated, such as Postural Gymnastics, Lian Gong in 18 Therapies, homeopatia, acupuntura, circular dance, meditação, yoga, auriculoterapia, phytoterapia, osteopathy, and Integrative Community Therapy (ICT). ICT is a collective therapeutic practice that promotes the construction of supportive social networks, the strengthening of bonds, and improved qualidade de vida. It has been officially recognized by the PNPIC since 2017. In Campinas, ICT began in 2006 with a visit from Professor Adalberto de Paula Barreto  psychiatrist and creator of ICT  who led an awareness activity with health professionals. Between 2008 and 2009, some public servants were trained by the Araraquara-São Carlos Training Center. Over time, however, retirements and staff changes led to a reduction in these terapia circles, although they were never fully discontinued³. PROBLEMS ADDRESSED: The reduction in ICT offerings highlighted the need to restore and strengthen the practice within the network. Between 2021 and 2022, new professionals joined SMS, some already trained in ICT. In response to the growing physical and emotional suffering of the population in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, ICT emerged as a valuable tool for support and care. Amid this scenario, the desire arose to resume training in ICT and establish a certified Training Center  institutions authorized to offer ICT training and/or courses in Self-Esteem Recovery Techniques (TRA). SMS representatives consulted the Brazilian Association of Integrative Community Therapy (ABRATECOM) for accreditation guidelines and mapped professionals in the network trained in ICT. To accredit a Training Center, a work plan must be submitted along with a team of at least three trainers certified in both ICT and TRA. The mapping identified six community therapists in the network, only one of whom was certified in TRA, while another was still in training. To meet accreditation requirements, a partnership was established with the Araraquara/UNESP Training Center. Thus, a steering group was formed, composed of five career public servants from SMS  all trained in ICT, two also certified in TRA  along with the support of a therapist from the Araraquara Center. The group developed the training curriculum based on their experiences, knowledge, and lived practice, and each member became responsible for different course modules. The training was conducted in accordance with ABRATECOMs criteria, officially consolidating the SUS Campinas Training Center. Campinas thus became the first certified SUS Training Center for Community Therapists in Brazil. RESULTS: The SUS Campinas Training Center is composed of career public servants from SMS, who work on the project as part of their regular work schedule. Two training cohorts in ICT have already been offered to Primary Health Care professionals in Campinas. The first ran from October 2022 to December 2023 and graduated 26 community therapists. The second cohort began in April 2024 and will conclude in May 2025, training 32 new therapists. RECOMMENDATIONS Teamwork has been a defining feature of the creation of the SUS Campinas Center. With official recognition as a Training Center, SMS gained autonomy in the education of community therapists, strengthening humanized care and contributing to the promotion of a culture of peace. Additionally, the Center allows for the formation of teams with appropriately qualified professionals, promotes care for the staff themselves, optimizes human resources, and responds promptly to the needs of services and territories  especially the most vulnerable. This experience has highlighted the value of interprofessional collaborative work: members of the steering group, initially unfamiliar with each other and coming from different areas, learned to work together with respect, active listening, and cooperation. Finally, each training cycle carries deep symbolism, values, and learning. Overcoming the challenges faced by the steering group at each stage has only strengthened their commitment to promoting collective and integrative care within SUS Campinas. References 1.

    "abstract": "This report describes a training offering in Integrative and Complementary Health Practices (PICS) within a Multiprofessional Residency Program in Family Health at ENSP/Fiocruz. The training is delivered through a Learning Unit (LU) titled \"Integrative and Complementary Health Practices (PICS) in Promoting Comprehensive Care in Primary Health Care.\" Motivation: This initiative aims to address the growing demand for a more holistic approach to care and the need to qualify health professionals for the effective incorporation of PICS into Brazil's Unified Health System (SUS), especially within Primary Health Care (PHC). Participants: The LU is offered in the second year of residency to a class of 28 students from seven distinct professional categories working in PHC. Objectives: To understand and discuss conceptual and regulatory frameworks of PICS, particularly in Brazil. To present some PICS modalities relevant to PHC and provide Residents with practical experiences as care moments. To discuss principles, perspectives, and strategies for care management within the scope of PICS in PHC. To recognize and critically analyze the characteristics of the work process in family health teams regarding PICS. To debate the challenges in service management for the implementation of PICS in PHC. Methodology & Content: The LU features a robust syllabus covering the guiding concepts and rationales of PICS and Traditional, Complementary, and Integrative Medicines (TCIM), their history, advancements, and challenges, as well as the approach to care from a multiprofessional perspective in PHC. A central point of the training is the discussion on the organization and management of the work process, aiming to integrate PICS into the agenda of multiprofessional teams in Basic Health Units. This professional training provides information and facilitates debate on the main PICS modalities offered in PHC. It also aims to qualify information about various articulation spaces (institutional, virtual networks, and strategic sites) and promote the sharing of municipal, state, and federal management experiences regarding PICS offerings in PHC. Throughout the LU, various PICS modalities are addressed, many with practical experiences, such as Floral Therapy, Auriculoterapia, Aromaterapia, Meditation, Traditional Chinese Medicine (with Lian Gong), and Reflexology. There is also a significant focus on the interface of PICS with Mental Health, including a workshop on Care Pathways and an Integrative Community Therapy Circle. Phytoterapia, encompassing the National Policy on Medicinal Plants and Phytotherapeutics and Popular Health Education, is also covered. The program is enriched by a vast bibliography, including mandatory and complementary readings for each class. This includes official documents from the Ministry of Health (such as the PNPIC and its ordinances for the inclusion of new practices), scientific articles from renowned journals, books, and multimedia resources (ObservaPICS podcasts, webinars, and YouTube videos). Desafios and difficulties encountered in the implementation and integration of PICS: Engagement difficulties among residents or healthcare teams. Desafios in integrating PICS into the daily routines of health services. Resistance from professionals or managers. Limitations of resources (human, financial, and material) for the practices. Logistical problems (e.g., scheduling, inadequate spaces). Discrepancies between the theory and practice of PICS within the SUS (Unified Health System). Difficulties in the regulation or acceptance of certain PICS modalities. The Learning Unit (LU) demonstrated a comprehensive and well-structured approach to PICS education. Program Scope and Structure: LU V was conducted from July 15 to August 26, 2025, totaling 120 hours of workload. The unit was taught once a week, comprising 40 synchronous hours and 20 asynchronous hours per week. The program was intensive and diversified, combining in-person classes with asynchronous activities, which included readings and the preparation of reviews of scientific texts on PICS. Content and Focus: The syllabus effectively covered guiding concepts and rationales of PICS and Traditional, Complementary, and Integrative Medicines (TCIM), their history, advancements, and challenges. It also addressed the multiprofessional approach to care in PHC and the organization and management of the work process for integrating PICS into multiprofessional teams in Basic Health Units. Key PICS modalities were addressed, often with practical experiences, including Floral Therapy, Auriculoterapia, Aromaterapia, Meditation, Traditional Chinese Medicine (with Lian Gong), and Reflexology. A significant focus was placed on the interface of PICS with Mental Health, featuring a workshop on Care Pathways and an Integrative Community Therapy Circle. Phytoterapia, the National Policy on Medicinal Plants and Phytotherapeutics, and Popular Health Education were also covered. Discussions included the management and indicators of PICS, as well as the challenges of managing and implementing PICS at state and municipal levels in Rio de Janeiro. Evaluative Outcome: As an evaluative assignment, students presented seminars on 'PICS and Professional Councils.' This involved research into the legislation and standardization of PICS modalities from the PNPIC (National Policy on Integrative and Complementary Practices) within Professional Councils (Regional and Federal) for the 14 health professional categories recognized by the National Health Council (CNS). Based on the experience with this Learning Unit (LU), the following recommendations are put forth: Improvements to the curriculum or the practical activities of the LU should be considered. Ways to expand the LU's offering to other residency programs or institutions should be explored. Lessons Learned & Conclusion: A key lesson learned is that including this PICS Learning Unit within a residency program significantly contributes to the advancement of knowledge in PICS and health education. It is concluded that the PICS Learning Unit within a residency program holds substantial potential to offer in-depth and practical training on PICS. This empowers Residents working in Primary Health Care (PHC) to integrate these practices into comprehensive healthcare, fostering a critical perspective on their implementation, management, and regulation within the Unified Health System (SUS).",

    "abstract": "This relato de experiência describes implementing a 21-day SMART (Stress Management through Autonomic Regulation Training) breathwork protocol for mental health enhancement through autonomic nervous system modulation. The intervenção combined coherent breathing with CO tolerance training across diverse populations through iBreathwork Certification. Among 123 participants, 98.4% demonstrated meaningful improvement in at least one domain, with significant reductions in stress (74% improved), ansiedade (71.5% improved), and enhanced energy (66.7% improved) and emotional control (62.6% improved). Results support breathwork integration into complementary medicine for population wellness. Primary challenges included widespread chronic stress and autonomic dysregulation manifesting as ansiedade, emotional reactivity, cognitive dysfunction, and reduced vitality. Traditional approaches focus on symptom management rather than physiological imbalances, necessitating root-cause intervençãos. Implementation barriers included participant skepticism about breathing efetividade, time management difficulties during stressful periods, and technical mastery challenges with coherent breathing timing. Resource limitations required creative adaptations for diverse socioeconomic contexts. Institutional resistance necessitated extensive education about breathwork's scientific foundation. Solutions included comprehensive facilitator training, flexible protocols adaptable to individual circumstances, gradual progression building confidence, and community support elements normalizing challenges while celebrating successes. Quantitative resultados demonstrated remarkable efetividade. Stress decreased from 3.93 to 2.95 points (25% improvement, 74% achieving meaningful reduction). Anxiety improved from 3.99 to 2.97 (25.6% enhancement, 71.5% positive response). Mental clarity increased from 3.21 to 4.02 (25.2% improvement, 61.8% meaningful gains). Energy showed largest improvements, rising from 3.20 to 4.15 (29.7% enhancement, 66.7% improvement). Emotional control improved from 3.27 to 4.10 (25.4% enhancement, 62.6% better regulation). Most significantly, 98.4% improved in at least one domain, with 57.7% showing enhancement across four or more dimensions. Effect sizes (Cohen's d: 0.44-0.51) indicated moderate-to-large clinical significance comparable to established intervençãos. Qualitative feedback revealed enhanced self-awareness, immediate stress relief, improved sleep, and increased resilience. Participants described techniques as \"reset buttons\" enabling proactive stress management. Excellent segurança profile with no serious adverse events and high satisfaction rates. Evidence supports healthcare integration as preventive and therapeutic approaches. Primary care providers should teach basic techniques during visits, providing immediate stress tools. Educational institutions should implement breathing practices supporting student wellness and learning capacity. Workplace programs represent ideal contexts given immediate stress relief and emotional regulation benefits. Future research should include randomized controlled trials with physiological measures and long-term follow-up evaluating sustainability. Dose-response investigations could optimize protocols for different populations. The SMART Protocol demonstrates that complex benefits can be achieved through accessible, evidence-informed intervençãos. This contributes to growing evidence supporting breathwork integration into complementary medicine, offering practical pathways for addressing modern mental health challenges.",

    "abstract": "Based on Rudolf Steiner's anthroposophic educational conception, we developed a training algorithm for our preceptors and medical residents, considering the multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary health environment in the Unified Health System (SUS), using integration with the spiral of different stages educational, in the context of the Constructivist Spiral (CS).The training plan considers the doctor and the health resident as the focus of cooperative learning conducted using imagination tools (understanding the clinical image) forming a health community that supports the development of inspiration to intuition in the process of healthcare and healing. Teaching the teacher in teaching is a challenge to be embraced by all health professionals, being improved by the Integrated Curriculum of Anthroposophical Medicine (ICURAM). In this context, the present work aimed to bring the experience and perception of the proposing preceptor professor in relation to the use of the combination of CS and AM in the context of the improvement of other professors of the otorhinolaryngology residency program at FMJ, as well as in the training of residents. Both theories are used in classes, experiences and in patient care, under the teaching supervision of the preceptor, who is a specialist in neurosurgery with international certification to practice AM. At the Jundiaí School of Medicine (FMJ), where this study was conducted, the otorhinolaryngology residency program was created in 1976, and was the institution's first medical residency program. Its focus is on the FMJ's specialty outpatient clinic, the University Hospital, the São Vicente Charity Hospital, the Jundiaí Regional Hospital, and the Therapeutic Association for Auditory and Language Stimulation (ATEAL). The otorhinolaryngology residency program at FMJ has been strongly based on the CS opened to inclusion of AM pratices. During their activities, the resident acts as the protagonist in a multidisciplinary training. The educational activities highlight the particularities of the service, such as the resident's responsibilities at the hospital level, in patient care and community health awareness campaigns. The approach supports the resident's work on several fronts, always with transparency and with the broad repertoire of tools at their disposal. In this context, the preceptor guide the student in the following topics: - Construction of new meanings. Preceptors must act so that residents seek a new synthesis, which encompasses particularities of the healthcare process, taking into account the holistic vision and the dimension of patient segurança, in addition to ethical precepts. - Evaluation of process and products. Highlight the importance of verbal formative assessment at the end of each resident activity, with self-assessment, peer assessment and the assessment that they will make of the preceptor staff, enabling preceptor work to be carried out with greater confidence regarding the need to delve deeper into the identification of the clinical problem. The knowledge from ICURAM was added to provide the preceptor staff with an integrated action that includes the resident's strategy to develop the following attributes: · Know how to approach the patient in an ethical and humane manner. · Identify diseases based on clinical and armed propaedeutics. · Formulate differential diagnoses of prevalent diseases. · Identify appropriate therapeutic guidelines. · Perform correct referrals, avoiding incompetence and recklessness. · Properly fill out all medical documentation. · Comply with the complete clinical and surgical protocol for healthcare in our specialty. In each activity, the staff of preceptors is led to encourage residents to self-evaluate and self-regulate in their practical skills, valuing the knowledge they already have. Thus, the student has the opportunity to reflect on their actions and, in their interface with the preceptor and the daily routine of the medical residency, develop new potentials for their field of activity. In each activity, the staff of preceptors is led to encourage residents to self-evaluate and self-regulate in their practical skills, valuing the knowledge they already have. Thus, the student has the opportunity to reflect on their actions and, in their interface with the preceptor and the daily routine of the medical residency, develop new potentials for their field of activity. This experience led to an integrative and multidisciplinary formation that has been shown differential and efficient ways to approach different healthcare conditions, both in private or saúde pública context. The role of educators in different areas is to exchange, build and rebuild knowledge in order to form active individuals in society, committed to their professions and objectives. Education goes far beyond training and conditioning someone to certain skills. The preceptor teacher, in turn, tends to transmit everything he or she knows to the resident, which is not sufficient for the essence of learning, and is far from the meaning of learning, especially considering areas of healthcare. Exposing the relevant aspects of the teaching-learning process tends to make the resident more independent in the construction of knowledge, so the preceptor must be able to sensitively identify the resident's level of understanding. The expansion of the concept of education in the training of resident physicians must move from an exclusive process of acquiring knowledge or skills (based on the simple and pure exposure of content and techniques) to the development of a professional critical awareness, which has been shown to be beneficially expanded by the use of the concepts of the integrated curriculum of AM and CS. One of the main challengers is to include effectively the practices of AM and CS in the different medical residency programs, which certainly will chance the scenery of public healthcare in Brazil.",

    "abstract": "Objectives: To share resultados in cancer patients treated with the S.I.S.e.O. This retrospective study describes the experience of 25 patients with various types of cancer who were treated with the Okada-style Integrated Health System (S.I.S.e.O) as a complement to conventional medical tratamentos. The S.I.S.e.O combines practices such as Johrei (energy channeling), the appreciation of beauty, and natural nutrition to promote holistic well-being. Clinical variables, disease progression, survival, and qualidade de vida were analyzed. The results suggest that this complementary intervenção contributes to the relief of physical, emotional, and spiritual suffering and improves qualidade de vida during and after cancer tratamento. Limitations include:  Loss to follow-up in some cases  Lack of a control group  Retrospective and descriptive nature of the study Still, the results invite us to consider more human-centered care models with multidimensional support, integrating medical tratamento with more holistic therapies. Results 1. The evaluated group included patients with various types and stages of cancer, from children to elderly adults. Many were in advanced or metastatic stages. 2. The cases involved adenocarcinomas (rectal, breast, colon, pancreatic), carcinomas (tongue, cervix, parotid), lymphomas (T-cell and non-Hodgkin), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (A.L.L.), and sarcomas. Most were undergoing aggressive multimodal tratamentos such as major surgery, radioterapia, polychemoterapia, and hormone terapia. 3. Due to the severity of their conditions and the potential disabling element, patients experienced significant symptoms such as dor crônica, fatigue, nausea, insomnia, ansiedade, anguish and depressive episodes. In this context, the S.I.S.e.O. was a complementary intervenção to alleviate the emotional and physical burdens. 4. It was possible to analyze subjective life quality expressed in words frequently repeated, such as changes, relaxation, peace, improvements in anguish and fears, gratitude, and spiritual and physical well-being, them being the most representative and qualidade de vida reinsured by the treating doctor. Summary of Patient Comments (Subjective Perception of S.I.S.e.O. Effects) Patient testimonials reflected a broadly positive perception of S.I.S.e.O. as a complementary tool in their medical tratamento:  Emotional well-being: Several patients reported feeling more relaxed, uplifted, or energized after sessions. Common phrases included \"it relaxes me,\" \"I feel relaxed and energized,\" or \"very uplifted.\"  Psycho-spiritual support: Some described the S.I.S.e.O. as providing support during difficult times, e.g., \"a spiritual and physical support\" or \"a light of hope.\"  Therapeutic aid: It was noted as \"a significant help in getting through tratamento\".  No efeitos adversos: Nearly all patients reported \"no significant side effects,\" indicating tolerability.  Physical symptom relief: Frequently reported relief from pain, reduced nausea and vomiting, improved sleep and appetite. The analysis of these 25 cases suggests that a comprehensive medical approach may be associated with prolonged survival and a positive perception of qualidade de vida. The patients expressions of peace, relief from distress, and sense of meaning point to the importance of addressing the physical, emotional, and spiritual dimensions. These findings support the need to continue scientifically exploring and validating the Okada Style Integrated Health System as a complement to conventional medical care.",

    "abstract": "FloreSer is a therapeutic program conducted at ASI/HURCG in Ponta Grossa, Paraná, in southern Brazil. The target population consists mostly of women with fibromyalgia referred from the dor crônica clinic. As a chronic and multifactorial condition, fibromyalgia is often neglected due to its lack of visible physical markers, requiring a comprehensive and humanized care approach. The protocol spans 12 weeks, with weekly three-hour sessions divided between educational activities and practical experiences. The intervençãos are based on an integrative view of health (physical, emotional, spiritual, social, and planetary), Lifestyle Medicine, PICS, and Social Care Technologies. Practices include aromaterapia, auriculoterapia, fitoterapia, meditação, healthy eating, forgiveness workshops, integrative community terapia, tai chi chuan, restorative justice circles, music terapia, and group dynamics. The team comprises a psychologist, physician, nurse, pharmacist, physiotherapist, multiprofessional residents, and, depending on the semester, a nutritionist, occupational therapist, and physical education professional. ASI, as a teaching-assistance space, facilitates the integration of education, research, outreach, and health services, strengthening training in health and the efetividade of the SUS. The main needs identified among participants include: severe dor crônica, fatigue, emotional distress, lack of empathetic care and qualified listening in health services, social isolation, excessive medicalization, and low self-esteem. The fragmentation of care and the disease-centered biomedical model have proven insufficient in addressing the complexity of illness. The absence of strong therapeutic bonds exacerbates the sense of abandonment. FloreSer proposes a person-centered, community-based, and network-connected care approach, fostering transformation through listening, belonging, and empowerment. The FloreSer Program showed significant and lasting impacts on participants lives, with consistent improvements in physical, emotional, social, and behavioral aspects. The 12-week multimodal and multiprofessional therapeutic protocol, based on PICS and health education, promoted self-care and contributed to pain relief and increased perception of well-being. Participants reported improved mood, sleep quality, self-esteem, and motivation for lifestyle changes. Techniques such as foot baths, aromaterapia, conscious breathing, healthy eating, walking, and Integrative Community Therapy (ICT) circles became part of their daily routines, promoting autonomy and empowerment. The forgiveness workshop and other symbolic experiences led to deep emotional reframing and reconnection with life purpose. Quantitatively, one study revealed a statistically significant increase in the average self-care scores in the intervenção group (IG), from 49.58 to 57.25 by the end of the protocol (p = 0.008). In the control group (CG), the change from 54.33 to 54.67 was not statistically significant (p = 0.867). Additionally, studies developed within two undergraduate theses and two masters dissertations indicated that the self-care benefits were sustained even one year after the intervenção, demonstrating the programs lasting impact. To ensure the continuity and expansion of initiatives like FloreSer, it is recommended that PICS and social technologies be institutionally recognized within health management. It is necessary to address cultural and epistemological resistance within teams and to expand integrative practice training in health-related acadêmico programs. Key challenges include securing stable funding, valuing multiprofessional work, and systematically monitoring the program's impacts, with support from management, educational institutions, and social control mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Integrative Community Therapy (ICT) is a Brazilian social technology developed in 1987 in the Pirambu favela, one of the largest urban slums in Fortaleza, in the Northeast of Brazil. Created by psychiatrist Adalberto de Paula Barreto, ICT responded to the lack of access to mental healthcare and emotional support in marginalized territories impacted by poverty, violence, and exclusion. It is based on five theoretical pillars: Systemic Thinking, Cultural Anthropology, Paulo Freires Pedagogy, Resilience Theory, and Complex Thinking, offering a holistic and humanizing view of suffering and healing. ICT is implemented across a variety of settings, especially in vulnerable areas such as peripheral urban neighborhoods, rural zones, Indigenous and Quilombola communities, shelters, prisons, schools, universities, and health services. It has been institutionalized within Brazils Unified Health System (SUS) and recognized as an official Integrative and Complementary Health Practice (PICS) through Ordinance No. 2,326/2024. The method is now used in over 1,500 municipalities in Brazil and more than 40 countries in Latin America, Africa, Europe, and Asia. The central method of ICT is the \"terapia circle,\" a structured group meeting facilitated by trained community therapists. Each session follows five steps: (1) welcoming, (2) selection of a concern, (3) contextualization, (4) shared life experiences, and (5) symbolic closure. The process values horizontality, mutual respect, cultural diversity, and collective wisdom. Rather than offering advice or diagnosis, ICT invites participants to listen, share, and recognize their inner strengths. Initially designed for in-person practice, ICT was quickly adapted to virtual formats during the COVID-19 pandemic. Online circles preserved the core methodology and created therapeutic spaces for people experiencing ansiedade, grief, loneliness, and violence. Participants from across Braziland beyondconnected to listen and support each other. This transition expanded ICTs reach and intercultural exchange potential. In Brazil, ICT is often implemented through partnerships involving universities, saúde pública services, NGOs, and local governments. A key example is the Integrative Health Outpatient Clinic (ASI) at the State University of Ponta Grossa (UEPG), in southern Brazil. ASI integrates ICT with other practices like auriculoterapia, phytoterapia, meditação, and healing circles, offering care to women with fibromyalgia, mothers of children in neonatal ICUs, and health workers experiencing burnout. The Brazilian context reflects the limitations of a health system still dominated by the biomedical model, with insufficient psychosocial care and long waitlists for specialized services. ICT addresses these gaps by offering a low-cost, high-impact alternative that strengthens listening, community ties, and autonomy. In the territories where ICT is active, structural challenges such as poverty, violence, and social disintegration are common. ICT restores the value of community dialogue, fostering belonging, hope, and resilience. It does not replace clinical tratamento but complements it by involving people in their own healing journey and transforming pain into collective meaning. Cultural adaptability is another strength. ICT respects local identities and values diverse forms of knowledge, including oral traditions and community memory. It is practiced in Indigenous villages, favelas, and rural communities, always adapting without losing its essence. ICTs growth has also inspired policy and advocacy efforts. It has been included in health worker training, integrated into social programs, and presented at international forums as a model of humanized, democratic care. It has even been applied in conflict mediation contexts, such as supporting Ukrainian and Russian communities or refugee populations in Africa. Despite its successes, ICT faces challenges. Many circles rely on volunteer efforts, and resistance from traditional, hierarchical health models persists. Digital exclusion also limits the reach of online formats in some regions. Overcoming these obstacles requires institutional commitment, continued training, sustainable funding, and the integration of community-based care into health policies. In sum, ICT offers an accessible and transformative response to the emotional suffering exacerbated by inequality and the pandemic. As a Brazilian social technology, it contributes to global mental health efforts, reaffirms the power of collective healing, and promotes equity, participation, and peace. Excessive medicalization of human suffering, especially where emotional distress is treated primarily with medication instead of holistic approaches; Lack of qualified listening spaces within SUS, leaving many individuals feeling unheard and unsupported; Social isolation and weakened support networks, worsened by the COVID-19 pandemic and structural inequalities; Stigma related to mental health and vulnerability, which discourages people from seeking help and sharing experiences; Low interprofessional integration in health services, limiting coordinated and effective responses to complex mental health demands. ICT offers a concrete, low-cost, community-based, and integrative alternative. It restores the value of lived experience, promotes autonomy and resilience, and strengthens social empowerment through inclusive, culturally sensitive, and non-hierarchical spaces that foster participation, belonging, and collective healing. Numerous studies have demonstrated ICT's efetividade. In a study with 65 participants during the pandemic, significant improvements were observed in psychological well-being, interpersonal relationships, environmental mastery, and life purpose (REIS et al., 2025). In a university hospital setting, ICT combined with auriculoterapia contributed to reduced stress, ansiedade, and pain, as well as increased happiness, sleep quality, and emotional well-being (BORGES et al., 2024). Data from SISAB (Primary Care Information System) indicate a steady increase in the documentation of ICT circles and growing engagement by municipalities. ICT has also been adopted as a humanitarian tool in international conflict mediation and refugee support settings, demonstrating its cultural adaptability and scalability. During the COVID-19 pandemic, ICT stood out as an innovative and effective response to socioemotional challenges, with wide territorial coverage across Brazil. Between 2017 and 2024, more than 37,000 ICT circles were officially recorded in SUS information systems, involving nearly half a million participations in 27.4% of Brazilian municipalities. These figures are likely underestimated due to underreporting and current limitations in recording collective and community-based practices in national health data systems. Recomendações: Expand ICT integration into mental health and continuing education policies. Promote training of community therapists and institutional support for terapia circles.

    "abstract": "Traditional, Complementary, and Integrative Medicines (TCMIM) were institutionalized in Brazil through the approval of the National Policy on Integrative and Complementary Health Practices (Política Nacional de Práticas Integrativas e Complementares  PNPIC), established by Ordinance GM/MS No. 971, dated May 3, 2006. This policy aims to expand healthcare approaches within SUS, fostering integrality and humanized care (Brazil, 2015). Their origins date back to the 1970s, during the period of military dictatorship, when the dominant biomedical and welfare-centered model began to be questioned and holistic care approaches were debated at the 8th National Health Conference in 1986. It took 20 years for the national policy to be formally instituted, and since then, the 29 practices currently regulated have gradually been recognized by SUS (Silva et al., 2023). In the state of Acre, located in the Brazilian Legal Amazon, cultural diversity, the presence of traditional communities, limited access to health servicescommon in the North compared to other regionsand the lack of acadêmico and scientific engagement with TCMIM at UFAC made the implementation of the League particularly relevant. Within this context, the Academic League of Traditional, Complementary, and Integrative Medicines was founded in 2023 at the Federal University of Acre (UFAC) through a pioneering extension project initiated by students in the Public Health program. The initiative aimed to train students in health-related programs in integrative approaches and to promote community outreach activities. Due to the scarcity of content related to TCMIM in the curricula of undergraduate health programs, which limits professional readiness to work with these practices, and the resistance of some professionals and health managers to incorporating themoften due to lack of knowledge or persistent bias, as noted by Barros et al. (2020)proposing integrative and complementary care strategies was particularly challenging. Despite the regions rich repository of traditional knowledge, healthcare practices related to TCMIM continue to occur in a fragmented and unsystematic manner, often operating on the margins of the saúde pública system. Over the Leagues two years of existence, theoretical and practical introductory training sessions were conducted in 8-hour and 20-hour formats, focusing on the following techniques:  Auriculoterapia (targeting protocols for ansiedade and depressão),  Reflexology (used for relaxation and pain relief),  Cupping terapia (centered on treating ansiedade, depressão, and stress), and  Yoga (focused on conscious breathing exercises). In total, 21 students were trained in auriculoterapia, 20 in reflexology and cupping terapia, and 14 in yoga. Care services were provided at the Teaching Clinic of the Center for Health and Sports Sciences (CCSD) at UFAC. During its first operational month, the clinic functioned three days a week, with rotating teams, and served a total of 142 individuals. In addition, the League carried out outreach activities at the State Institute for Socio-Educational Measures (Instituto de Medidas Socioeducativas do Estado do Acre  ISE) and the Municipal Autism Support Center (Centro de Atendimento ao Autista  CAA), reaching 15 and 25 individuals, respectively. The beneficiaries included students, outsourced workers, adolescents under protective custody, healthcare professionals, and SUS users. Beyond institutional partnerships, the activities of the Academic League also led to the establishment of a similar initiative in Cruzeiro do Sul, located in the Juruá region of Acre. Operating through UFACs Floresta Campus, this new League has continued offering care in hospitals, emergency care units (UPAs), and primary healthcare units (UBSs) following the initial training phase. Despite the progress achieved so far, the following recommendations are made:  Include TCMIM content in the national curricular guidelines of undergraduate health programs to ensure adequate professional training;  Strengthen partnerships among universities, healthcare services, and communities to promote the integration of these practices into SUS;  Encourage research focused on evaluating the efetividade and efficacy of TCMIM, thereby contributing to the production of scientific evidence that supports and validates these approaches within saúde pública policy.",

    "abstract": "Traditional, Complementary, and Integrative Medicines (TCMIM) play a relevant role in promoting mental health by offering care approaches that help relieve psychological distress and improve overall well-being. These practices serve as complementary resources to conventional mental health tratamentos, contributing to the reduction of stress, ansiedade, depressão, and related symptoms. In Brazil, Ordinance GM/MS No. 971, dated May 3, 2006, established the National Policy on Integrative and Complementary Practices (PNPIC  Política Nacional de Práticas Integrativas e Complementares). This policy aims to broaden healthcare approaches within the Unified Health System (SUS  Sistema Único de Saúde), promoting integrality and humanization in healthcare services (Brazil, 2015). The Health and Well-Being Project emerged in response to the growing demands and pressures faced by healthcare professionals in Brazil. Its primary objective is to train Family Health Strategy teams and multiprofessional teams in promoting mental health through TCMIM, enhancing the role of health professionals as transformative agents in their communities. The project was developed through a partnership between the Brazilian Ministry of Health, the Ageu Magalhães Research Institute (IAM), and the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation of Pernambuco (Fiocruz/PE), and implemented in the state of Acre by the State Health Department through the Center for Integrative Practices and the Maria Moreira da Rocha Technical School of Health. Designed for municipalities with fewer than 70,000 inhabitants, the project was carried out in the following municipalities: Acrelândia, Assis Brasil, Bujari, Brasiléia, Capixaba, Cruzeiro do Sul, Epitaciolândia, Feijó, Jordão, Mâncio Lima, Manoel Urbano, Marechal Thaumaturgo, Plácido de Castro, Porto Acre, Porto Walter, Rio Branco, Rodrigues Alves, Santa Rosa, Sena Madureira, Senador Guiomard, Tarauacá, and Xapuri. It involved the collaboration of 10 local tutors, 1 territory coordinator, 1 pedagogical coordinator, and the TCMIM technical reference from the State Health Department. Using a problem-based methodology and the Maguerez Arch, participants were encouraged to observe their territories and identify occurrences that could be addressed through intervenção, considering the local context and realities. The Maguerez Arch is a pedagogical tool designed to foster critical thinking and learning through problem analysis and solution development. It consists of five stages: Observation of Reality, Identification of Key Points, Theorization, Hypothesis Formulation, and Application to Reality. Students were guided to design an intervenção project targeting a specific population and employing an integrative practice suitable for addressing the identified issue. A total of 154 professionals from Family Health teams and multiprofessional teams were trained. The professional categories included nurses, community health agents, psychologists, physiotherapists, and physical education professionals. Following the diagnostic and planning stages, 43 intervenção projects were developed in the state of Acre, all employing TCMIM techniques, such as massage and self-massage, meditação, auriculoterapia, music terapia, dance, body practices, art terapia, and aromaterapia. The practices were applied to a variety of groups, including mothers of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), elderly individuals, women's groups, and the health teams themselves. Examples of presented projects include:  PRO-MEDITAR: Integrative and Complementary Meditation Practice for Promoting Mental Health in Primary Care in Acrelândia;  Balance and Well-being: Integrative practices for the mental health of older adults;  Healing Encounters: Community terapia for the elderly;  The Sound I Do Not Hear: Music terapia as a tool for self-recovery;  SerenaMENTE: Promoting a serene and peaceful mind;  Youth and Adolescents Facing Drug Abuse and Anxiety: Use of music terapia and collective activities. One of the main challenges faced during the implementation of the project involved municipalities with difficult access, such as Santa Rosa, Jordão, Marechal Thaumaturgo, and Porto Walter. In these locations, training was conducted entirely online due to geographical constraints, as access is only possible by air (single-engine aircraft). Despite these challenges, all training activities were successfully completed. Before the implementation of the Health and Well-Being Project, TCMIM practices were reported in only 8 municipalities in the state of Acre. After the project, this number increased to 21 municipalitiesreaching 90% of the state's territory. Health professionals who participated expressed interest in further specialized training to support more comprehensive care delivery. According to social worker Gleiciane Cardoso, from the municipality of Porto Acre, the practices implemented in the intervençãos promoted dignity and restored participants self-esteem. The Health and Well-Being Project presented new possibilities for care and self-care to Family Health Strategy teams and multiprofessional teams, introducing TCMIM as empowering tools for delivering humane and welcoming mental healthcare. These practices were applied both in preventive care and in the tratamento of individuals already affected by mental health conditions. TCMIM techniques can be incorporated into routine services, strengthening and enhancing the group-based activities already carried out by healthcare teams. The qualification of primary healthcare professionals in TCMIM techniques emerged as a strong demand during the projects implementation, signaling the need for continued investment in this area. Professionals themselves identified interest in training for group-appropriate methods such as circular dance, integrative community terapia, auriculoterapia, aromaterapia, and Chinese medicine-based body practices. This demand has been formally submitted to the State Health Department and is set to be prioritized as part of the continuing education strategy for healthcare professionals in 2026.",

    "abstract": "Salto Veloso is a municipality with urban and rural territory located in the mid-west region of Santa Catarina and a population of 4,301 inhabitants (IBGE, 2010), of which 925 are women over 45 years of age. In the area of health, the municipality has two family health teams (ESF), which share the same physical space, and has 47 employees. ESF coverage in the territory is 100%.With the increase in life expectancy and the aging of the population, considering that the life expectancy of women in Brazil is 79.4 years, it is expected that a large part of the female population will spend approximately one third of their lives post-menopause. Menopause is an inevitable and significant period in women's lives, in which there is a reduction in hormone production, which leads to a series of consequences for the body. It is characterized by the natural cessation of menstruation due to decreased ovarian function, in which physical changes are experienced. On the other hand, urogenital aging represents a common process in the post-menopausal period, with possible changes in vaginal dryness, irritation, sensitivity and pain during sexual intercourse, as well as urinary incontinence, decreased genital vascularization, loss of sensitivity, hot flashes and recurrent lower urinary tract infections. The negative impact on women's qualidade de vida becomes evident, associated not only with the metabolic aspect, but also with the social aspect (SHIRAZ et al., 2021). Providing a better qualidade de vida during this phase of menopause complementary and integrative tratamentos , mainly through the use of medicinal teas such as white mulberry leaf and flaxseed, as they contain large amounts of phytoestrogens, which are molecules that have the effect of the estrogen hormone in the body and help to alleviate the symptoms of menopause, being used as a way to alleviate the symptoms caused by hormonal reduction. In this context, several long-term therapies are implemented in the tratamento of menopause symptoms, aiming to alleviate symptoms and mitigate urogenital aging. Some of these complementary therapies include the use of minerals and vitamins, acupuntura, physical exercise and dietary changes. In addition, fitoterapias have been used on a large scale to reduce the symptoms of menopause (OZCAN et al., 2019). Sampling of all patients aged 45 and over who had some type of medical or nursing consultation at the Salto Veloso health unit. Six stages were followed to conduct the study: choosing the topic and formatting the research question, applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, identifying the age group, as well as the year selected to begin the introduction of complementary e and integrative tratamentoo reduce hormone replacement terapia, categorizing the selected studies, discussing the results and presenting the review or synthesis of knowledge. The first stage consisted of defining the theme in order to answer the guiding question of the research: What are the phytotherapies and complementary integrative tratamentos used and their efetividade in the adjuvant tratamento of menopause symptoms The second stage consisted of searching for the availability of articles on the topic in the scientific literature. In the third and fourth stages, the inclusion criteria were: patients over 45 years of age, correlating patients seen by the unit's nurses with the number of patients referred and seen by the Gynecologist for HRT, between 2023 and 2024. Then, a comparative evaluation of these data and their results was carried out. However, it was determined that more than half of the women evaluated did not have adequate information about the menopause process. In 2022, it was performed by nurses with CIAP X11 Signs/symptoms of menopause/climacteric 21 patients In 2022, it was performed by a gynecologist with ICD N951 State of menopause and female climacteric 32 patients In 2023, it was performed by nurses with CIAP X11 Signs/symptoms of menopause/climacteric 31 patients In 2023, it was performed by a gynecologist with ICD N951 State of menopause and female climacteric 28 patients In 2024, it was performed by nurses with CIAP X11 Signs/symptoms of menopause/climacteric 44 patients In 2024, it was performed by a gynecologist with ICD N951 State of menopause and female climacteric 25 patients The above data were taken from the municipal e-sus system. In this way, we can observe the increasing number of consultations with nursing professionals, as well as the decrease in the number of consultations with gynecologists. This is the consequence of the effects of complementary and integrative tratamento as fewer patients were referred for tratamento of menopause. It is worth remembering that nurses provide complementary and integrative tratamento in partnership with the Pastoral da Saúde. Herbal remedies are very effective and have few side effects when compared to HRT.However, more studies and ensaio clínicos are needed to make these medicinal herbs such as white mulberry tea, sage, green tea, ginger and soy isoflavone a complementary tratamento for the tratamento of symptoms associated with menopause in the near future. Based on the comprehensive review on the use of fitoterapia in the tratamento of menopause, it is clear that medicinal plants are promising and effective for women seeking to alleviate symptoms such as hot flashes, depressão and genitourinary symptoms.(SciELO Brazil-2021).Herbs such as black cohosh, turmeric, Hypericum perforatum, among others, have demonstrated significant benefits with fewer side effects when compared to conventional hormone therapies. However, current research still lacks robust studies that fully validate their efficacy and long-term segurança, highlighting the need for more well-controlled ensaio clínicos and standardization in cultivation and extraction methods. Therefore, while phytoterapia represents a promising therapeutic option, it is crucial to continue advancing the understanding of its mechanisms of action and clinical impacts to better guide its clinical use and enhance its benefits in improving the qualidade de vida of women in menopause.

    "abstract": "Desintoxica SP is a volunteer-based initiative that provides humanized care to individuals in situations of social vulnerability, with a focus on substance use disorders and psychological distress. Founded in 2019, the project was from the emerging need for action with the abandonment of substance users in the Cracolândia region, in São Paulo. Using Traditional Chinese Medicine as a foundation, Desintoxica SP offers free healthcare services through Integrative and Complementary Health Practices, such as acupuntura, auriculoterapia, cupping terapia, reiki, therapeutic massage, and aromaterapia. The target population includes people experiencing homelessness, LGBTQIA+ individuals, and others in extreme social exclusion, aiming to relieve withdrawal symptoms, reduce ansiedade, and promote holistic well-being. Participants are referred by outreach programs such as Consultório na Rua and Centro Pop and undergo a process of personalized assessment, registration, and care planning. The project also invests in the continuous training of volunteers, who receive both theoretical and practical education to ensure safe and effective practice. All clinical data is recorded in a dedicated mobile application, allowing secure information storage and enabling data analysis and reporting. The use of complementary integrative therapies, especially acupuntura, has proven to be increasingly significant for disorders related to substance abuse and for people in social vulnerability, including physical, mental and cognitive aspects that interfere with their qualidade de vida. Lack of consistent public policies for substance users, stigma, limited access to compassionate care, and gaps in conventional health services. More than 11,000 individuals have been treated free of charge since 2019. Participants report significant reduction in withdrawal symptoms, ansiedade, and pain. Improved social engagement and restored sense of dignity were also observed. There is an urgent need to incorporate Integrative and Complementary Health Practices into saúde pública strategies for vulnerable populations. Key challenges include maintaining consistent care, expanding infrastructure and volunteer capacity, and securing stable public and private partnerships.",

    "abstract": "Context & Setting Metabolic syndrome is a global health concern linked to rising rates of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, obesity, and inflammatory conditions. Traditional management strategies often lack personalization, leaving patients disengaged and confused. Recognizing this gap, our acadêmico healthcare system launched a 4-week virtual Metabolic Health Program to provide early intervenção, empower behavior change, and integrate modern technology with holistic principles. Objectives The goal was to implement a scalable, cost-effective, and patient-centered metabolic health program using Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) and guided lifestyle intervençãos. The program aimed to: Improve metabolic awareness through CGM data Promote personalized behavior change Integrate Eastern and Western strategies to support long-term health Chronological Flow The program was delivered virtually over four weeks to cohorts of 2030 patients per group. Each group met weekly for 60-minute Zoom sessions, facilitated by a physician or trained health coach. Sessions included didactic teaching, CGM data review, group discussion, and personalized recommendations. Materials & Procedures Week 1: Participants received CGMs and completed baseline labs (fasting insulin, CMP, HbA1c, lipids, CRP) and InBody scans. The session focused on insulin resistance, glucose metabolism, and CGM use. Week 2: Participants reviewed their glucose trends, learning how food timing, stress, sleep, and movement affected their levels. Concepts like chrono-nutrition and intermittent fasting were introduced. Week 3: Focused on lifestyle adjustmentsmacronutrient balance, fiber, herbs (e.g., turmeric, cinnamon, fenugreek), and individualized exercise plans. Week 4: Final data review, long-term planning, sleep hygiene, and stress management strategies were emphasized. Participants received a personalized health roadmap. Participants Patients ranged from those with prediabetes and insulin resistance to those seeking weight loss, hormone balance, and improved energy. Referrals came from physicians (55%), online platforms (16%), family/friends (13%), and dietitians (11%). All participants were adults with basic digital literacy and interest in metabolic health. Theoretical Framework The program was informed by integrative medicine principles, using both clinical science (glucose metabolism, behavioral nutrition) and Eastern frameworks (circadian rhythm, mindful eating, Ayurvedic digestive concepts). Key Desafios Metabolic syndrome affects over a third of U.S. adults and is rising globally. It contributes to major chronic diseases and imposes a significant economic burden. Current clinical approaches often treat symptoms rather than root causes. They rely heavily on weight loss and medication, lacking real-time feedback and personalization. Impact of Desafios Patients frequently feel overwhelmed by conflicting advice, unsure which foods or habits are contributing to symptoms like fatigue, belly fat, and poor sleep. Traditional intervençãos miss the opportunity to engage patients earlybefore blood glucose, cholesterol, or body composition reach critical thresholds. Resource Limitations Many clinics lack the infrastructure or staffing to offer individualized nutrition or lifestyle coaching. Our program was designed to overcome this by using a virtual group model that is both efficient and high-touch, leveraging technology for real-time biofeedback. Participant Engagement and Satisfaction Survey results from 50 participants showed: 100% would recommend the program 82% found the CGM and app somewhat or extremely easy to use 88% planned to use CGM again 60% preferred extending the course to 6 weeks 62% felt 60-minute sessions were adequate, while others wanted more time Behavior Change and Insights Open-ended responses revealed key takeaways: Understanding personal glucose responses to different foods Learning how food order (fiber protein/fat carbs) reduces glucose spikes Importance of meal timing, early dinners, and reduced snacking Impact of sleep, stress, and exercise on glucose Realizing healthy foods sometimes spike glucose, and some indulgences dont Sample participant quote: This was life-changing. I learned that I can change patterns in my health through routine and discipline. Knowledge Acquisition Participants were empowered to self-experiment and interpret their CGM trends. Eastern teachings like breakfast as the biggest meal or eating with the sun were well received and validated by glucose data. Participants reported increased confidence in making informed food and lifestyle choices. Program Delivery & Scalability The virtual group format proved effective and sustainable. A single physician or coach could guide up to 30 patients at once, combining education, real-time data interpretation, and peer support. Minimal infrastructure was needed beyond CGMs and Zoom access. Evidence & Analysis Participant feedback showed improvement in: Awareness of metabolic triggers Reduction in glucose variability Increased physical activity and mindful eating Greater adherence to sleep and meal routines Empowerment and health confidence As one participant noted: I always thought I had to avoid carbs completely. Now I know how to enjoy them the right way for my body. Objectives Assessment All objectives were met: patients gained metabolic literacy, adopted personalized strategies, and integrated both scientific and holistic tools for long-term health.

    "abstract": "Primary care in the Family Health Strategy provides healthcare services to the population within its designated territory, offering assistance, prevenção and promoção da saúde initiatives. In line with this healthcare approach, the Extension Project Less Pain More Health was established in response to the demand from a Family Health Clinic in Niterói, Rio de Janeiro. This Project was developed in partnership with the Medical Internship Supervision of Fluminense Federal University (UFF) and Federal State Health Foundation of Niterói (FeSaúde). The main objective of the Project was to treat patients suffering from dor crônica of various origins using a combined methodology of monthly therapeutic-educational group sessions and weekly acupuntura tratamentos. The experience with the Extension Project has shown a reduction in pain complaints, decreased reliance on pain medications, relief from negative emotions associated with dor crônica and improvements in patients personal, family and work lives, ultimately enhancing their overall qualidade de vida. This proposal aligns with the 2006 National Policy on Integrative and Complementary Practices (Política Nacional de Práticas Integrativas e Complementares), which prioritizes integrative practices in atenção primária under the current Family Health Strategy model (Estratégia Saúde da Família) (BRASIL, 2006). The following key considerations were taken into account for the proposals certification: 1. Patient demand: The presence of dor crônica patients under the care of atenção primária/family health professionals; 2. Referral delays: Slow referral processes for patients requiring secondary care; 3. Trained professionals: Availability of technically qualified staff for patient education and dor crônica management at the primary/family health unit; 4. Management support: Backing from the management of the family health unit where the initiative will take place; 5. Supervised training: Oversight of medical interns from the Federal Fluminense Universitys (Universidade Federal Fluminense) Faculty of Medicine by an instructor qualified to conduct the health intervenção; 6. Educational groups: Sessions for eligible patients, with participation from trainees; 7. Combined approach: An educational component paired with individualized acupuntura tratamento sessions for eligible patients. During the 18-month duration of the Extension Project \"Less Pain More Health\" , 36 patients participated regularly in the monthly group meetings, with the majority being female and over 60 years old. The first three sessions focused on: 1. Patient's reception; 2. Sharing individual stories of physical and non-physical pain; 3. Reports of negative emotions associated with dor crônica, predominantly sadness, anger, or resentment; 4. Accounts of functional impairment hindering or preventing paid or unpaid work; 5. Disruption of close emotional and family relationships due to disbelief about the severity of pain; 6. Links between dor crônica and comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, trauma, and neoplasms; 7. Associations between dor crônica and prescription drug misuse or self-medication; 8. Connections between dor crônica and polypharmacy (analgesics, anti-inflammatories, anticonvulsants, and anxiolytics/antidepressants); 9. Ties between dor crônica and increased alcohol consumption; 10. Relationships between dor crônica and reduced self-care (e.g., sedentary behavior, unhealthy diet, and poor posture). Subsequent sessions addressed pain management through: 1. Postural guidance and video-led exercises by the physiotherapist; 2. Training in active listening, empathy, and validation of each others dor crônica experiencesled by the occupational therapist and psychologist; 3. Encouraging open communication about emotions within families, including those tied to dor crônicafacilitated by all team members; 4. Promoting dialogue with the Family Health Team to improve pain-related careled by the psychologist; 5. Guidance on adherence to prescribed dor crônica medicationsprovided by the family physician; 6. Empowerment through reframing dor crônica narratives into learning experiences about health and lifeguided by the supervisor and medical interns. The final three sessions revealed: 1. Reports of significant reductions in dor crônica levels; 2. Improved daily functionality, with some patients resuming paid work; 3. Enhanced self-esteem, self-confidence, self-care, and clearer communication about pain-related and unrelated emotions in personal/family settings; 4. Observable behaviors of joy and satisfaction during group meetings. Acupuncture: All 32 users/patients received weekly individualized acupuntura sessions, totaling at least 10 sessions. Of these, 20 patients continued tratamento for over six months (24+ sessions). Key results included: 1. Patients completing 10 sessions reported pain reduction from 8 to 3 on the visual analog scale (VAS); 2. Some in this group noted improved sleep, daytime relaxation, and reduced sadness/anger linked to pain; 3. Even those with <10 sessions reported better mood and positive feedback from relatives; 4. Patients with 10 sessionsespecially those completing 24+demonstrated: o Improved functionality and return to previously pain-restricted activities; o Reduced ansiedade, significant medication/alcohol reduction, and better control of non-pain-related diagnoses; o Enhanced self-esteem, self-confidence, and self-care, as noted by patients and families. The Extension Project Less Pain, More Health was initiated in the Teixeira de Freitas Family Health Unit in Niterói's Fonseca neighborhood, in collaboration with medical internship supervision. It emerged in response to dor crônica patients experiencing significantly compromised qualidade de vida despite conventional medical tratamento. The project's combined approach - integrating monthly therapeutic educational groups with weekly individualized acupuntura sessions - demonstrated significant advances in: 1. Alleviating dor crônica conditions 2. Improving non-pain related comorbidities 3. Reducing excessive medication use (including complete discontinuation in some cases) 4. Addressing negative emotions associated with pain and its impact on personal, family, and work life 5. Enhancing overall qualidade de vida Conclusion The Extension Project \"Less Pain More Health\" represents a successful methodological approach achieving comprehensive atenção primária objectives. It serves as:  A cornerstone of family healthcare practice  An intervenção addressing tratamento, prevenção, and promoção da saúde simultaneously  A means of strengthening patient-health unit relationships This model effectively demonstrates the potential of integrative approaches in atenção primária settings.",

    "abstract": "This relato de experiência describes the implementation of Traditional, Complementary and Integrative Medicine (TCIM) practices at the Medical Specialties Outpatient Clinic (AME) of Santa Casa de Assis during the Yellow September campaigna Brazilian national suicide prevenção and mental health awareness initiative. The intervenção aimed to promote the emotional well-being of health professionals who work in a high-pressure institutional environment. The initiative addressed the growing demand for preventive mental health strategies in healthcare workplaces, fostering life appreciation and psychological balance. Objectives: Provide moments of self-care, relaxation and inner connection. Immediately reduce stress and ansiedade. Encourage the use of simple well-being techniques that professionals can apply in their daily lives. Cronologia and Procedures: Two groups were formed through prior registration, with 14 participants each (total of 28). Each group participated in two different practices during the month. On September 30, the closing lecture Inner Awakening: Overcoming, Happiness and Purpose was delivered. Practice Steps: Welcome and grounding (5 min): conscious breathing and a welcoming environment. Mobility and stretching (5 min): neck, shoulders, arms, and spine. Standing postures (15 min): Tadasana (Mountain Pose); Adapted Utkatasana (Gentle Chair Pose); Twists and balance (Tree Pose). Breathing techniques (5 min): Nadi Shodhana (alternate nostril breathing) and sighs with sound release. Guided relaxation (15 min): Application of lavender essential oil to the hands in a cupped shape for mindful inhalation; Music: Águas da Amazônia  Japurá River; Gentle return to awareness with breath and slow movements. Yoga Nidra: Time for spontaneous sharing at the end of the session. Materials and Resources Used: Institutional chairs, yoga mats and rugs, lavender essential oil, a sound system for therapeutic music, and verbal guidance using welcoming language. Participants: Twenty-eight health professionals participated voluntarily, all wearing formal clothing. Practices adapted to the time and space available. Theoretical basis: Yoga, Mindfulness, Aromaterapia and Music Therapy. Theoretical Framework: The practice integrated foundations of Yoga, Mindfulness, Aromaterapia, and Music Therapy, providing sensory and emotional stimuli that foster presence and well-being. Main Desafios: Adapting techniques to formal attire and the physical structure of the environment. Maintaining focus and an atmosphere of introspection amidst the work routine. Overcoming initial skepticism or resistance from some professionals. Impact of Desafios: Desafios were overcome with careful adaptations, a welcoming approach and conscious guidance that made the experience accessible and transformative for all participants. There was an immediate improvement in the participants bodily, emotional, and mental awareness. The atmosphere at the end of the sessions was one of calm, lightness, and gratitude. Representative Testimonials (Qualitative): Woman 1 (2530 years old), with insomnia and a diagnosis of depressive disorder: Wow, it had been a long time since I felt this light. That music took me to a place of deep peace and stillnessmy whole body relaxed, like I was in nature. It reminded me of when I go to the waterfall. Woman 2 (3540 years old), anxious and with an explosive personality: My God, this practice is so relaxing. By the end, it felt like my body was floating. Such enormous peaceI want to do this always! Lessons Learned: Even when done sporadically, the practices offer techniques that professionals can carry into their personal routines, promoting self-care autonomy and greater awareness of their mental and emotional health. There was voluntary participation, positive feedback, an immediate sense of well-being, and a desire to continue the practices. Practical Recomendações: Include TCIM practices in the institutional calendar; Assign a dedicated professional to conduct TCIM practices, ensuring continuity and expansion; Provide basic resources such as essential oils and therapeutic playlists. Future Directions: Increase frequency and reach of the practices; Implement evaluation protocols with well-being feedback; Integrate TCIM practices into regular professional appreciation initiatives. Contribution to the Field: The AME Assis experience demonstrates that Traditional, Complementary and Integrative Medicine (TCIM) practicesrecognized by the Unified Health System (SUS), Brazils public healthcare systemare effective, feasible, and low-cost strategies to promote mental health among health professionals. Caring for caregivers positively impacts the quality of patient care.",

    "abstract": "The use of Viscum album L. via subcutaneous injection is well recognized for its immunomodulatory activities, particularly in the tratamento of malignant neoplasms. However, some conditions with autoimmune pathology are not related to cancer. Rosacea is one such example. This case series describes the resultados of applying Viscum album hydrogel in facial rosacea in three patients, with clinical and photographic follow-up of the lesions. This experience was implemented at private medical practices. One male patient was monitored from March 2019 to September 2020, and two female patients have been under follow-up since November 2024 to the present. The 2019-2020 patient initially received injectable Viscum album (Malus 1 mg) via subcutaneous injection, then transitioned to topical hydrogel application at the affected area. Patients were instructed to apply the hydrogel on the face affected area after bathing at night, prior to any other products. Periodic photographs were taken and submitted without editing. All three cases showed improvement based on clinical assessments and photographic analysis, including reduced number of small acne-like lesions, decreased erythema, and a reduction in local heat sensation. All three cases showed improvement based on clinical assessments and photographic analysis, including reduced number of small acne-like lesions, decreased erythema, and a reduction in local heat sensation. This study supports the recognized immunomodulatory effects of injectable Viscum album via subcutaneous administration and raises the possibility of using hydrogel formulations for non-cancerous and pre-cancerous skin lesions. Such an approach could improve patient adherence due to its lower cost, ease of application, and better tolerability compared to injectable forms, ultimately enhancing tratamento compliance. Recomendações: 1- Conduct randomized controlled ensaio clínicos with larger sample sizes to validate the preliminary resultados observed; 2- Encourage integration regarding the use of Viscum album hydrogel into complementary and conventional dermatological care approaches; 3- Enhance patient education to improve adherence to non-invasive topical tratamentos. Desafios: 1- Lack of a control or placebo group, which limits the ability to distinguish tratamento effect from spontaneous improvement or placebo response; 2- Small sample size and individual variability in clinical presentation of rosacea limit the clinical evidence; 3- Limited commercial availability and regulatory approval of topical Viscum album formulations.",

    "abstract": "Work integrated learning (WIL) is an educational approach that purposefully integrates relevant work-based experiences into curriculum design. Its primary aim is to bridge theoretical knowledge with practical application, thereby fostering authentic learning while enhancing students transferrable skills and employability resultados. WIL involves three key stakeholders: the student, the university and the industry sector in which the student will eventually work. Torrens University Australia (TUA) through its founding college, the Southern School of Natural Therapies (SSNT), has been a pioneer in naturopathic education, delivering clinical qualifications continuously for over 60 years. Within this context, WIL has traditionally been embedded in the final years of the program where students undertake pre-clinic observations and supervised placements as practitioners in the universitys purpose-built, student-led clinic \"The Practice\", While this approach has proven successful, in 2018, as part of a comprehensive course review, the university sought to develop a more immersive WIL program to enhance: - Industry specific knowledge - Practice and dispensary management skills - Employability skills - Scaffolded learning The COVID-19 pandemic prompted a further evolution and rapid adaptation of the traditional in-person WIL model. In response, the university implemented several initiatives including; a virtual industry speaker series and industry trade show, telehealth consultations for the clinic, online clinic observations, synchronous online workshops and practical intensives, to maintain continuity of experiential learning. Following the easing of pandemic restrictions, the WIL program expanded through support from the Australian Governments New Colombo Plan, enabling international placements and cross-cultural learning experiences. The enhanced WIL program fosters broader graduate attributes, including: - social justice - global citizenship - intercultural competence The design and implementation of the revised WIL model are underpinned by Kolbs Experiential Learning Theory, which conceptualises learning as a cyclical process involving concrete experience, reflective observation, abstract conceptualization, and active experimentation. This model supports the integration of hands-on clinical practice with reflective and theoretical learning, aligning with the programs goal of producing work-ready graduates equipped for the complexities of contemporary naturopathic practice. In the pre-clinic WIL program students were placed in the universitys dedicated clinic to engage in entry-level tasks. However, the program faced facility-related challenges due to a significant increase in enrolments. Additionally, the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic required a rapid transition from on-campus to virtual delivery. These factors required the acadêmico team to innovate and diversify the WIL experience. The current hybrid WIL model incorporates a range of learning activities:  virtual industry speaker series  appointment as client at the university clinic  workshops on dispensary and administration skills  observation placements with external practitioners  virtual practice observations  simulated clinic with mock clients  shadowing placements at the university clinic  student practitioner clinic placements  international WIL experience to visit health facilities in Nepal WIL adaptations were particularly well received by industry stakeholders who valued the direct connection with students. An industry consultant role manages stakeholder relationships and mitigates any potential conflicts of interest. This role proved essential to reduce the administrative burden on acadêmicos and maintain equitable engagement with external partners as program numbers continue to grow. Despite overall positive engagement, some students expressed resistance to independently source external observation placements. To address this, the university implemented an online placement search tool, Careers Connect, populated with opportunities procured by the industry team who vet placement opportunities, manage legal agreements, and support students throughout the process. More recently, an online, interactive WIL Toolkit was created to equip students with essential skills and confidence for placement success. The toolkit includes interactive modules on resume and cover letter writing, employer expectations, and industry standards. An informal quality assurance questionnaire of the hybrid pre-clinical WIL program completed during 2023 and 2024, elicited 123 responses across three campus locations. The majority of comments were positive and included the following insights:  The most valuable learning experiences were in-person workshops, including dispensary and administration activities. Industry guest speakers, appointment at the student clinic and WIL resources were also of value.  Over 80% of students felt confident to implement learning in the future.  Over 90% rated the WIL program as valuable to their professional development. Students undertaking observation and shadowing placements in year 3 complete a reflective assessment. Open-ended comments indicate satisfaction with the program, with students expressing confidence in transitioning to the student practitioner role. Sample reflections include: - The clinic (observation) experience was great. - Really prepared me for what I am to be doing when I do my clinic placement - I loved the in-clinic observation period Of students exiting, 100% felt confident to practice within a clinical setting or find employment within the profession. Three quarters of them intended to establish private practice. Regarding the Nepal WIL program, 103 complementary health students participated between 2022 to 2025. In the program, students engage with various health and education organisations to expand cultural understanding and foster global perspectives. Students consistently describe the experience as transformational, inspiring and motivational. They report increased awareness of equity in access to healthcare, community health problem-solving, and their role as future change-makers. This report documents the evolving nature of WIL which has developed from a final clinical component to an immersive inquiry-based experience. Interpersonal skills, professional attributes and capabilities are scaffolded throughout the program to support employability and practice readiness. The program will continue to evolve with a suggested expansion of clinical placement opportunities and live briefs from industry stakeholders. Incorporating herbal manufacturing training into the pre-clinic WIL program may further strengthen student preparedness for employment and career success. The initial objectives of the WIL program were modified to include a much more diverse program of activities than originally anticipated. Feedback indicates WIL experiences are well received and a valuable part of the overall student learning experience.",

    "abstract": "Program: This proposal focuses on preserving and sharing ancestral knowledge related to the use of herbal syrups for treating respiratory conditions such as productive coughs, based on family traditions and ethnobotanical wisdom. The project involves: Conducting interviews with individuals who maintain these practices. Recording recipes and preparation methods through audiovisual and written formats. Analyzing the medicinal plants and their roles in these formulations. Highlighting the emotional and cultural impact of these practices on health and well-being. Abstract Traditional medicine is a cornerstone of Uruguays cultural heritage, with family-based knowledge passed down through generations. This project aims to document, preserve, and disseminate recipes for herbal syrups used to alleviate respiratory conditions like coughs and colds, particularly during winter. These remedies often include plants such as Urtica dioica, Micania glomerata, Salvia officinalis y Cecropia adenopus, valued for their efetividade and cultural significance. By interviewing practitioners, the study records authentic recipes and their historical contexts. Methodologies include in-person and remote interviews via video, audio, or text, ensuring diverse participation. This work emphasizes the importance of direct familial transmission and excludes sources like books or internet recipes to maintain authenticity. 1. Progressive loss of traditional knowledge: The intergenerational transmission of knowledge about the use of medicinal plants is at risk due to urbanization, medicalization, and the lack of appreciation for natural practices, which threatens the continuity of this cultural heritage. 2. Lack of systematization of traditional knowledge: Despite their widespread use at the family level, homemade cough syrups made with medicinal plants often lack scientific systematization that allows their recipes, uses, and effects to be recorded, compared, and validated. 3. Poor coordination between folk medicine and saúde pública: Homemade cough syrups represent an accessible and low-cost atenção primária resource; however, they are not typically considered by formal health systems, which prevents their use as a complementary tool in respiratory prevenção and care. Preliminary results: It was confirmed that there is a family tradition in Uruguay of preparing homemade cough syrups, as well as various herbal remedies, infusions, decoctions, and macerations. These are used as adjuvants in the tratamento of coughs, flu, and colds, resulting in great relief from the symptoms of these respiratory conditions. Interviewees describe their preparation, method of administration, and the resulting well-being or improvement. This popular tradition exists in Uruguayan families, which endures and is sustained over time, from generation to generation, thanks to the successful results obtained that demonstrate its efetividade through practice. More than 30 interviews were conducted to record these valuable ancestral family experiences in healthcare in Uruguay. The goal was to preserve these experiences, study the medicinal plants used, and finally, publish the research results so that the recipes generously provided in the interviews would be freely accessible and available. This information will be uploaded to the Uruguayan School of Naturopathy website and will be freely accessible. Twenty-two medicinal plants used in herbal preparations were recorded and botanically identified for further study. A list was compiled with their scientific nomenclature. It was found that some medicinal plants are present in several recipes, such as Guaco (Mikania glomerata), Loquat (Eriobotrya japonicao), Climbing Sage (Lippia alba), Onion (Allium cepa), and Lemon (Citrus limon). We also found that of the total number of plant species recorded, only a third were native to Uruguay, the majority being exotic. It was also observed that native plants are repeated in several recipes. The primary methodology used was a face-to-face interview, in which a series of questions were asked, emphasizing that the shared recipes had to be for family use only and used effectively within the family over time. Recipes were requested to be sent via audio recording via WhatsApp message to facilitate submission and registration. A complementary audiovisual presentation was edited with this material, featuring the voices of some of the interviewees as a representative of this relato de experiência. The audio recordings describe the preparation and administration process, as well as the emotional bond with family as an ever-present intangible ingredient. The loving memory of the recipes, the intention to heal, and the pleasant feeling always present in the stories, as well as the well-being achieved with symptom relief, were confirmed. An important fact is that the ingredients in most of the recipes are easily and inexpensively accessible and can be prepared with items already present in the home. Even the medicinal plants used in these recipes are present in most family gardens and orchards, often not requiring purchase. The practice of sharing the plants needed for these preparations among friends, neighbors, and family is highlighted, highlighting the beautiful community bond that seeks to share popular healing practices. More than 40 recipes were obtained and recorded on a spreadsheet as an annex. Another spreadsheet also recorded the information of the interviewees and their geographical origins, highlighting that most of the recipes come from rural areas in different departments of Uruguay. Another complementary material is a spreadsheet on the recorded medicinal plants. Among the recipes, we highlight the preparation of \"Quemadillo\" syrup, which is repeated in several recipes and is prepared with burnt or caramelized sugar to which various medicinal plants are added. The sugar is quickly heated in the caramel for a few seconds, and then water is added, thus decocting for a few minutes until the liquid concentrates. This syrup is taken warm by the spoonful to relieve coughs, and it can also be drunk as a cup before bed. The description of this \"Quemadillo\" syrup is only an example; all recipes are recorded on the registration form, along with their quantities, preparation method, and administration. The resultados will serve to: Promote the understanding of ethnobotanical practices. Encourage integration of these methods within contemporary health frameworks. Highlight the emotional bonds tied to ancestral health practices. This initiative bridges tradition and modernity, fostering respect for cultural heritage while addressing contemporary health challenges. The project contributes to the global recognition of Uruguays rich medicinal legacy and supports its preservation for future generations.",

    "abstract": "Surf terapia combines the physical benefits of exercise with the transformative experience of being in contact with nature. It also provides a sense of belonging and emotional resilience, while strengthening social skills. Participating in activities in a marine environment is said to be a catalyst for overcoming trauma and developing autonomy. This report aims to share the experience of the Ondas Arpoador project, which has been running since January 2022 at Arpoador Beach in Rio de Janeiro. The project's primary focus is on surf terapia and inclusive diving, catering to individuals with various disabilities and psychological conditions, including cerebral palsy, autism, schizophrenia, visual impairment, and a history of substance abuse. Since its inception, the project has served approximately 200 people between the ages of seven and seventy, and has become a benchmark in beach-based therapeutic care, combining contact with nature with the strengthening of emotional bonds and the promotion of comprehensive health. The adopted methodology prioritises sensitive adaptation to the needs of each participant, respecting individuality without imposing pre-established forms of action. This allows participants to experience the sea as a process of self-knowledge and overcoming barriers. Activities are led by surf instructors, psychotherapists and dedicated volunteers and are divided into three stages: welcoming participants and helping them to adapt to the environment; surfing or diving; and finally, therapeutic listening. In general, we observed remarkable improvements in self-confidence, autonomy, self-esteem, socialisation and communication, as reported by participants. Participants also described improved sleep, reduced ansiedade and stress, and an increased sense of pleasure and joy. Many participants reported that they had overcome barriers. Those with autism spectrum disorder showed improvement in emotional regulation and socialisation. Routine predictability and the natural environment act as emotional support elements, reducing sensory overload episodes and promoting calmness. For people with schizophrenia, surfing has proven to be a therapeutic activity that helps them to regain their sense of presence and connection with reality, alleviating negative symptoms such as apathy and isolation. Subjects with a history of substance abuse often report that the adrenaline rush of surfing replaces their craving for substances, providing a healthy source of pleasure. Recidivism is reduced while self-esteem and identity are strengthened with each session. For people with cerebral palsy, the physical benefits are clear: improved posture, stronger muscles, increased mobility and greater stamina. Additionally, the emotional and symbolic aspects of the experience, such as overcoming fear, experiencing pleasure and feeling a sense of equality, emerge as central components of subjective transformation. For people with visual impairments, increased self-esteem, a sense of belonging, autonomy, body awareness, and improved orientation and mobility are observed. The project is conducted exclusively with its own funding and is not tied to any institutions. Consequently, it has limited resources. This poses a significant challenge to its maintenance and continuity, given that the majority of participants lack the socioeconomic means to pay for the service. Scarce resources make it unfeasible to expand to a larger number of participants, despite the deep social mobilisation based on empathy and acceptance. The Ondas Arpoador project has proven to be a powerful tool for care and inclusion, offering an effective and sensitive alternative to conventional therapeutic practices. By combining surf terapia with psychotherapeutic listening and community interaction, the initiative reimagines approaches to treating psychological distress and physical limitations, reframing the body and the sea as domains of strength and dignity. Direct involvement with participants, attentive monitoring by professionals and the commitment of volunteers reveal the power of experiences based on affection and presence. In this context, the sea ceases to be merely a landscape and becomes a welcoming, transformative space.",

    "abstract": "Introduction : Mental health is intrinsically linked to an individual's social, cultural, and economic context. Factors like work overload, exposure to distressing situations, and pressure for results can compromise the mental health of healthcare professionals. Therefore, this research aims to investigate the impact of an innovative initiative, \"Caring for the Caregiver,\" on promoting the well-being and mental health of employees in Basic Health Units (UBSs). This initiative utilizes Integrative and Complementary Practices (ICPs) to offer a space for support and care to professionals, thereby strengthening the team and, consequently, the quality of care provided to the population. Objective: The objective was to promote the well-being and mental health of staff members before or after their assessment for accreditation by ONA (National Accreditation Organization), a non-governmental entity that certifies the quality of healthcare services in Brazil. The \"Caring for the Caregiver\" initiative used Integrative and Complementary Health Practices (ICPs) to provide a space for support and care to professionals, aiming to strengthen the team and improve the quality of care and support. Methodology : The \"Caring for the Caregiver\" initiative took place on March 21, 2024, May 15, 2024, May 16, 2024, June 6, 2024, June 14, 2024, May 13, 2025, and May 19, 2025, across seven Basic Health Units (UBSs) in Jardim São Luiz. Participants included staff members (doctors, nurses, nursing technicians, community health agents, and others, aged between 18 and 60) who were participating or would participate in the ONA accreditation process. The practices offered included meditação, auriculoterapia, aromaterapia, self-massage, reflexology, conversation circles, and breathing techniques. These were conducted at various times to accommodate the largest possible number of employees. At the end of the activities, a questionnaire was administered via Google Forms to evaluate participant satisfaction, addressing aspects such as well-being, stress reduction, and perceived usefulness of the practices performed. Results This analysis was based on data collected from 93 participants through online questionnaires. The study aimed to investigate the acceptance, impact, and availability of Integrative and Complementary Practices (ICPs) in workplaces. The results offer a detailed perspective on the relevance of these intervençãos for professionals' health and well-being. Adoption and Satisfaction Levels with ICPs A strong preference and high satisfaction rate for the incorporation of ICPs were observed among participants. Meditation and breathing techniques emerged as the most sought-after modalities, accounting for 74.2% of participation. This substantial percentage indicates significant interest and acceptance of these approaches, solidifying their position as preferred options among the evaluated professionals. To a lesser extent, reflexology and auriculoterapia were also accessed, both with 12.9% participation. The overall perception of satisfaction regarding the implemented intervençãos was notably high. On a scale of 1 (unsatisfactory) to 5 (excellent) for the proposed actions, the average rating attributed by employees reached 4.87. This value, very close to the theoretical maximum, corroborates the efetividade and positive impact of ICPs on participants' experiences. Physiological and Psychological Responses Post-Intervention The sensations reported by participants after engaging in ICPs demonstrated consistent positive resultados, though with variations depending on the modality: For auriculoterapia, 100% of participants reported feeling \"Very relaxed with physical and mental well-being,\" highlighting the potent anxiolytic and holistic effect of this practice. For meditação, the majority of individuals (81.2%) experienced a state of \"Very relaxed,\" while 17.4% reported feeling \"Calmer and with reduced stress\"; a small fraction (1.4%) indicated mixed sensations. Regarding reflexology, the perceived benefits were more heterogeneous: 41.7% of participants reported stress reduction, 33.3% achieved a state of deep relaxation, and 16.7% indicated increased physical disposition. Mixed sensations were cited by 8.3% of participants. These findings not only underscore the popularity of meditação and breathing techniques but also emphasize the intrinsic ability of ICPs in general to induce states of well-being, relaxation, and stress mitigation, significantly contributing to the improvement of individuals' qualidade de vida. Prevalence and Characterization of ICP Initiatives in the Workplace The investigation into the existence of groups, spaces, or initiatives supporting holistic health with a focus on ICPs in workplaces revealed a diverse landscape, predominantly characterized by informal actions. Specifically, 55.38% of respondents indicated the presence of informal or ad-hoc initiatives aimed at professional well-being, reflecting spontaneous engagement among teams in promoting health, even without a predefined formal structure. In contrast, 21.54% of participants reported the existence of formal and well-structured initiatives for this purpose, suggesting that these units have already integrated ICPs into their institutional well-being policies. However, 15.38% of respondents stated the absence of specific groups or spaces dedicated to this purpose in their units, indicating a gap in the provision of structured ICPs. Additionally, 7.69% of participants expressed unfamiliarity with the existence of any such initiatives in their respective units, which could point to either the actual absence of such programs or deficiencies in internal communication and dissemination of available resources. Implications and Relevance in the Context of Occupational Health The analyzed activities contributed to strengthening interpersonal bonds and fostering a healthier and more welcoming work environment. The relevance of these results is amplified when considering that contemporary studies on the health of professionals, particularly in the healthcare field, consistently point to a high prevalence of conditions such as emotional exhaustion, chronic stress, and Burnout Syndrome. The implementation and continuous promotion of ICPs can, therefore, represent effective strategies to mitigate such challenges, promoting greater resilience and psychophysical well-being among professionals. Conclusion The \"Caring for the Caregiver\" experience highlights the importance of investing in the well-being of healthcare professionals, as healthy employees are capable of providing higher quality care to the population. Integrative and Complementary Practices (ICPs) proved to be an effective tool for promoting the mental health and well-being of professionals, contributing to an improved qualidade de vida at work and the optimization of healthcare services. It is recommended to expand and continue these health-promoting initiatives for professionals, offering regular activities and establishing support groups. Furthermore, it is crucial that healthcare institutions invest in training and empowering professionals so they can identify and address the mental health needs of their colleagues.",

    "abstract": "Circular Dances are part of the Integrative and Complementary Health Practices (PICS) currently recognized in Brazil. In the international scenario, these practices are known as Traditional, Complementary and Integrative Medicine (TCIM). They were included in the National Policy for Integrative and Complementary Practices (PNPIC), instituted in 2006, through Ministerial Order No. 849 of March 27, 2017. Also known as Peoples' Dance, Circular Dances are performed in a circle, with music that supports body movements led by the facilitator. During this practice, rhythm, body expression and awareness, motor coordination and memory are worked, providing an environment for socializing, exchanging knowledge and experiences, integration, cooperation and respect for differences. Recognizing its benefits for the integral health of the population, this practice was incorporated into the PICS UFF Extension Project, created in 2019 at the Faculty of Pharmacy of the Fluminense Federal University (UFF, located in Niteroi, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil). The project is dedicated to disseminação scientific evidence about the efetividade of PICS/TCIM through posts in accessible language, which summarize scientific articles that have already been published. These posts are shared on the blog (PAULINO et al., 2019) and on the project's social networks: Instagram (@uffpics) and Facebook (PICS UFF), with Instagram currently being the most used platform. In addition to producing content, the project participates in acadêmico and scientific events, both internal and external to UFF, as well as initiatives carried out by partner institutions, such as the Niteroi Health Department. The experiences related to this report make it possible to solve two important issues related to Traditional, Complementary and Integrative Medicines (TCIM): (1) access to scientific evidence in this area, promoting scientific dissemination and also health education; and (2) access to PICS/TCIM experiences in different environments, both acadêmico and public places that are easily accessible to the local population. In these spaces, the project is presented and offers some PICS/TCIM, including experiences in Circular Dances. During the Covid-19 pandemic, the activities were maintained remotely, through transmissions via Instagram, YouTube, Google Meet and Zoom, ensuring the continuity of the experiences even in a challenging context. In view of the fruitful production and satisfactory feedback from the experiences carried out by PICS UFF, this practice was integrated into the research and extension project Integrative and Complementary Health Practices in the municipality of Niterói: promoção da saúde and awareness of self-care, which aims to expand the offer of actions and care in PICS/TCIM to Niterois population. This project was approved in 2020 by the call for proposals of the Applied Project Development Program (PDPA) - a partnership between the Niteroi City Hall, the Euclides da Cunha Foundation and the university (UFF). The work was expanded in 2024 with the Circular Dances Workshop, with weekly meetings, by the project Social Work with Elderly People: Participatory Processes in the Construction of Citizenship, which offers workshops, cultural and leisure activities to elderly people, and is held at the university's Advanced Space, linked to the School of Social Work at the Fluminense Federal University. This practice was also part of research projects conducted by two post-doctoral fellows, involving undergraduate students from the Faculty of Pharmacy and the School of Nursing at UFF. As a result, a scientific article (PAULINO et al., 2025a) and an e-book (BARBOSA et al., 2021) were produced, in which the practice of Circular Dances was contemplated, as well as presentations of papers at congresses (PAULINO et al., 2024a; PAULINO et al., 2024b), including expanded abstracts (PAULINO et al., 2025b), oral presentations, poster presentations and dance practices. Other contributions include the training of saúde pública workers in Niteroi (through the PDPA Project), the production of videos and educational materials on EduCapes (PAULINO et al., 2024c; PAULINO et al., 2024d), as well as teaching classes on Introduction to Integrative and Complementary Health Practices and Introduction to Natural Health Therapies, respectively, at the Faculty of Pharmacy and the School of Nursing at UFF. Experiences and workshops with Circular Dances were held in internal and external programs at UFF, including: Student Welcome and UFF's Academic Agenda, PICS Events (organized by NEPIC - Center for Studies in Integrative and Complementary Practices/UFF), event celebrating 15 years of the MPEA (Professional Master's Degree in Nursing Care/UFF), Yellow September Seminar/UFF, UFF in the Squares, Server's Week and National Health Day (promoted by the Health Promotion and Surveillance Division, linked to UFF's Coordination of Integral Health Care and Quality of Life). Some actions that included the practice of Circular Dances were carried out in partnership with the PICS/TCIM Coordination of the Niteroi Municipal Health Foundation, including some awareness-raising meetings for managers and professionals in Niteroi's saúde pública network (through the PDPA Project), the celebration of Pediatrician's Day at the Getúlio Vargas Filho Municipal Hospital - Getulinho (IGEDES, 2023) and the Nursing Week program at the Niteroi Health Foundation's Permanent Education Center. The aforementioned projects have brought important contributions to the fields of research, teaching and extension, with regard to PICS/TCIM, including work with Circular Dances, benefiting the acadêmico community, health professionals and the population. This practice has proved to be an important tool for education, prevenção and the promotion of integral health, in line with the principles established by the PNPIC.",

    "abstract": "The Hospital Alemão Oswaldo Cruz, recognized for its excellence in care and innovation, in conjunction with its Faculdade de Educação em Ciências da Saúde (School of Health Sciences Education), recently implemented the Specialization Course in Integrative Health. This course aimed to train professionals with a transdisciplinary profile in Integrative Health, fostering the development of competencies such as: effective communication with the interacting agent (patient) to provide welcoming care; critical analysis of clinical cases, seeking therapeutic balance and integrative practices best suited to the situations presented; and empathetic and decisive interaction with individuals of diverse backgrounds in various social and professional contexts, adopting a facilitative approach to identify the most appropriate/beneficial integrative practice for the interacting agent (patient). This approach promotes health, taking into account conventional care in conjunction with comprehensive care, incorporating the complexity of each individual in individualized, humanized tratamento, and reclaiming the concept of health in its totality. The specialization sought to train professionals capable of understanding the biopsychosocial-cultural factors of interacting agents, encouraging collaboration across different areas of knowledge for more humanized and effective care. The initiative reflected a global trend of valuing integrative health, aligning with the contemporary needs of a more comprehensive health system centered on the person, family, society, and planet. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of the training, and the applicability of the practices presented during the specialization in the personal and professional lives of the students. The study included eleven students who completed the Specialization Course in Integrative Health. A structured questionnaire was administered to all participants, developed by the course coordinators to assess the incorporation, applicability, and impact of integrative practices in their daily lives. The study identified the adherence, changes, and challenges of integrative practices in areas such as self-care, learning and applicability in personal and professional life, stress management, and qualidade de vida. Adherence to the multidimensional conception, considering the physical, metabolic, vital, mental, and supra-mental dimensions, was also observed. Greater incorporation was verified in daily self-care practices, including meditative practices, increased awareness in nutrition, use of floral remedies, yoga practice, and more frequent physical exercise. The primary lesson learned was the integration of these practices into daily routines. Despite the constant influx of health information, the specialization fostered awareness of self-care and its importance. Small daily actions and movements were recognized as essential for creating changes in habits and behaviors, often ingrained. It is these small changes that will corroborate for a consistency in personal, professional, social, and planetary life, thereby setting examples for others and contributing to collective well-being. Despite the challenges encountered, the study demonstrated that with knowledge, persistence, and application of integrative practices, these practices have become increasingly present, contributing to humanized care and improvements in promoção da saúde and maintenance, as well as in disease prevenção. This study confirmed the importance of self-care in the context of caregiving. Initiatives such as the Specialization Courses in Integrative Health are fundamental for shifting paradigms in the field of health, based on a holistic view that integrates the human being, society, and the planet. The inclusion of disciplines with this perspective in the university environment not only broadens collective awareness of individual and environmental responsibilities but also prepares future professionals to act with a multidimensional approach  essential for contemporary challenges.",

    "abstract": "Abstract This work describes the experience of an indigenous university student at UFPB, a Biomedicine major and daughter of a Potiguara Majé (an indigenous healer and spirituality guide), regarding the traditional use of embaúba water (Cecropia sp.) in her community. The tree, known for its medicinal properties, has its sap collected in a ritual during the full moon, when it releases the highest amount of liquid. The ritual, led by Majé Amanacy, involves requesting permission from the plants spirit and carefully collecting the sap at night. The gathered water is distributed and primarily used to treat kidney ailments. Descrição Since ancient times, ancestral knowledge has provided physical and spiritual healing through the forces of nature and the power of medicinal plants. The embaúba (Cecropia sp.) is a medicinal plant with various therapeutic properties distributed across its parts, and it grows abundantly throughout Brazil. Its use as an herbal remedy has been widely popularized by indigenous peoples, who consider it sacred. The Potiguara people refer to its sap as \"água da embaúba\" (embaúba water). Its name originates from the Tupi language, meaning \"hollow tree.\" Ants often nest inside its trunk, and it is also known as the \"sloth tree\" because these animals feed on its leaves and fruits. This work recounts the experience of an indigenous Biomedicine student at the Federal University of Paraíba, a teaching assistant in Phytoterapia, and the daughter of a Potiguara Majé from Rio Tinto, Paraíba. It aims to portray her experiences with collecting embaúba water in her community. Majé refers to an indigenous healer who works with care and spirituality. The Potiguara people in Paraíba are located on the northern coast, with their population distributed across urban areas and 33 villages. Majé Amanacy, a Potiguara healer, resides in the rural zone of Rio Tinto, performing healing practices and rituals with medicinal plants. The use of embaúba water in this community is an ancestral practice, preserved and conducted by Pajés (shamans) and Majés (shamans/healers), who guide and care for both physical and spiritual health. This knowledge is passed down through generations, from childhood to adulthood, as part of identity formation and cultural belonging. The collection of this water takes place in a ritual involving community members, beginning at 6 PM on the first night of the full moon. The Majé identifies a female tree (recognizable by its fruits), and together, they ask permission from the plants spirit before touching it. This request is made with respect and concentration, in silence or through chants. In this dialogue, the Majé explains the need to make an incision in the tree to collect its water and help a sick person in need. After this spiritual connection, the embaúbas root is carefully cleaned, removing excess soil, and a precise cut is made. A one-liter bottle is attached to collect the slowly dripping sap. This process is carried out with great care to ensure proper collection, as not a single drop should be wastedaccording to elders, each drop is precious. The dripping continues throughout the night, ending around 6 AM. During this time, participants sing to the spirits of Mother Nature, maintaining a firm intention to receive the trees permission, which is signaled by the first drops of the precious liquid. This ritual occurs during the first three nights of the full moon, collecting an average of 200 ml of embaúba water per night. At the end, all collected sap is combined into a single one-liter bottle, labeled, and stored in a refrigerator. It is distributed to people with kidney ailments for oral use50 ml three times a day for adults, and one tablespoon three times a day for children, alternating with mineral water. Many in the community attest to its efficacy, especially in cases of kidney stones, which users claim have dissolved without surgical intervenção. According to Majé Amanacy, embaúba water is most abundant during the full moon, with the clearest and most watery sap released on the third night. In a review study describing the main characteristics of the Cecropia genus, Daga et al. (2020) note that this genus belongs to the Urticaceae family, with a wide diversity of species across South America. In folk medicine, it has various uses, including as a hypoglycemic, antihypertensive, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and sedative agent. The authors highlight that Cecropia species have been studied for their phytochemical properties, with key compounds including orientin, isoorientin, isovitexin, vitexin, and C-glycosyl flavonoids. For the student, participating in these rituals has deeply influenced her personal and acadêmico journey, allowing her to experience the spiritual strength involved in the ceremonies and to deeply understand the connection between nature, ancestry, and healing. These experiences enable her to integrate her peoples traditional knowledge with acadêmico learning in Biomedicine, applying pharmacological insights while respecting practices of hygiene, labeling, and storage. These experiences have been enriching, strengthening her identity as an indigenous woman and future healthcare professional. She has learned the importance of listening, respect, spirituality, and connection with nature as guiding principles in the healing process. She sees it as her mission to continue this legacy, sharing the knowledge of embaúba water and ensuring that indigenous ancestral medicine remains alive, respected, and valued.",

    "abstract": "Integrative Community Therapy (ICT) is a participatory, community-based therapeutic intervenção of care, designed to foster collective resilience and emotional well-being in diverse contexts. Expanding ICT into Europe presents unique challenges and opportunities, particularly in countries with varying cultural contexts, healthcare structures, and mental health needs. ICT has expressed itself into many contexts beyond the material needs, but also emotional concerns that are linked with how to live in amplified diversity with so much austerity, autonomy but without losing connection, respect and good ambience. The open door to ICT in Europe was through francophones, in some workshops, conferences by the professor Adalberto Barreto and other main characters as Jean Pierre Boyer, Nicole Hugon, Christine Hertig, Christiane Feneon in France and Switzerland, that visualized in the 90s a based brazilian methodology of mutual hosting care. Today in Paris in two neighborhoods, at the Mairie of the arrondissement 15eme and 19eme, on saturdays mornings it has an open room that anyone who wants to take care of you mental health is welcome too, but mostly of the people who arrive are migrants from different roots. In this safe space they found good ambience that hosted them as people, with kind, warm arms and freedom to share your histories and feelings. Therefore in Brussels since 2014 many associations have opened their doors to the facilitators and instructors of ICT to provide and promote rounds of solidarity care. This city is known by its own plurality and divergences but also wherever takes place in critical moments ICT has shown itself a complementary tool to deal with emotional and social concerns, to families, friends and neighborhoods. Talking out about the ones who are nearby, Netherlands also approached to Belgium in 2019 and other hubs that integrate this network of ICT like TCI Rhone Alpes-FR, MISC Portugal and MISMEC 4 Varas-BR; those different places collaborate to spread this methodology and provide training to a group of people to start hosting rounds of ICT in their villages. In Portugal, the Division for Youth of the Cascais City Council developed a health project targeting people aged 12 to 30. Participants have access to Clinical Psychology and Nutrition consultations, as well as ICT circles. These circles take place once a week and typically include an average of five participants, mostly young women. Common concerns raised include exam and test ansiedade, difficulties in socializing, resistance to parental authority, frustration related to struggles with anorexia, and dependency on mobile phones. The participants identified several key coping strategies they found helpful, such as practicing acceptance, developing negotiation skills, valuing parents as a source of comfort and security, trusting their intuition when making decisions, reinterpreting problems and allowing them to pass, stargazing, and engaging in ICT activities. Later on Belgium, Italy, Ukraine, etc. this systemic integrative approach that gathers people around a circle in the period of 60 to 90 minutes to share life with respect, talking in I statements, its own life history with joy and sorrows, that explorate an active listening with no judgments or advices and rather expressing owns selves with poems, songs, smiles, hugs and tears. It's an open space to learn about its struggles and even share coping strategies. In England, we are looking to open up space to host ICT in England through implementing both in acadêmico settings with Clinical Psychology trainees and in the community with carers of brain injury survivors. With Clinical Psychology trainees, ICT sessions are integrated into the training curriculum, aiming to enhance the trainees' understanding of community mental health and their ability to facilitate group terapia sessions and to engage with diverse populations. This setting provides a space for trainees to learn and reflect on the therapeutic process while enhancing their clinical skills. In the community, ICT is implemented with carers of brain injury survivors, addressing the psychosocial challenges these carers face in supporting their loved ones. The community-based approach fosters mutual support, emotional expression, and resilience-building among carers, who often experience high levels of stress and isolation. ICT has been present to 46 countries since it began in Brazil, into the community of 4 Varas, that are localised into the Pirambus Favela, that's a vulnerable neighborhood of the city of Fortaleza, Ceará. In both contexts, ICT offers a potential solution to address current mental health struggles and the strain on saúde pública systems, particularly in light of long waiting times and the lack of qualified professionals. However, limitations include the need for cultural adaptation and potential challenges in maintaining engagement across diverse groups. Despite these challenges, ICT provides a promising approach to community mental health, offering new possibilities for promoting biopsychossocial health in Europe.",

    "abstract": "This relato de caso presents two field-based experiences of implementing Integrative Community Therapy (ICT) in low- and middle-income Sub-Saharan African countries: Malawi and Ivory Coast. ICT is a structured, culturally sensitive therapeutic practice that draws on community strengths and dialogue. It is grounded in five key pillars: systemic thinking, cultural anthropology, communication theory, Paulo Freires emancipatory pedagogy, and resilience theory. In Malawis Dzaleka Refugee Camphome to approximately 60,000 African refugees displaced by warICT was introduced to address acute psychosocial stress. This distress arose not only from the long-term impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, which disrupted communal bonds and caused personal losses, but also from the anticipated withdrawal of humanitarian aid. In 2025, international policy changes led to the closure of the UNHCR office, suspension of health services, and school shutdowns due to halted staff salaries. ICT aimed to offer a safe, culturally grounded space for emotional expression, support, and resilience-building within existing community structures. In the Ivory Coast (20222024), ICT was integrated into the Trust Fund for the Victims programme to support the regeneration of communities affected by the 2011 genocide. Training was delivered to three local NGOs, empowering participants as peer facilitators. Communities previously dependent on material aid began reclaiming ownership of their healing. In Malawi, 11 ICT sessions were facilitated in 2024 and 9 in 2025, involving 43 local educators, healthcare and psychosocial workers, and 35 community leaders and youth. Sessions were conducted in English, with interpretation into French and Swahili, and adapted to local narratives. In Ivory Coast, ICT training enabled trained facilitators to conduct circles that responded to the communitys grief, economic hardship, and historical trauma. This approach aimed to reduce psychological distress, strengthen collective coping mechanisms, amplify local voices, and foster resilience among those most affected by trauma and systemic instability. A complete training on ICT has been offered to three different local ONGs, empowering participants to become peer facilitators and agents of change. Participants reported suffering collective grief, economic problems, and the destruction of their homes. The ICT has fostered resilience at individual, family and community levels. After the genocide in many cities of the Ivory Coast, the communities had to organize themselves with their own ressources and help from ONGs and other humanitarian organizations that developed projects mostly focused on material assistance. On one hand, this has led to dependence and expectations that solutions would come from abroad. On the other hand, the communities have organized themselves around their own religious beliefs, women's movements and other associations that were enoughly prepared to receive new models of projects. Outcomes included strengthened community ties, reduced stigma, emotional healing, and enhanced local leadership. ICT offered an inclusive brave space, or espace d'écoute, parole et lien (space for listening, speaking, and connection). In both countries, participants found solidarity and empowerment through shared experience. The framework resonated strongly with traditional African values of collectivity and Ubuntu, which views knowledge as rooted in interconnectedness and reciprocity, regardless of age or status. In Ivory Coast, the Trust Fund for the Victim´s program which the ICT training, among other actions directed to regenerating the communities. In the words of a young participant in the training who was already in the field, in other actions, the ICT changed completely my relation with the community. I used to come here and develop projects for them, now I feel summoned to be in a horizontal relationship. When I´m in the circle, I feel I need to share my own experiences too, not just be there as someone from outside who comes to help. In the circle, we´re all together. Key challenges included logistical issues (e.g., translation, transportation) and cultural adaptation of ICT materials. Practical recommendations for future implementation include: employing a train-the-trainer model to build local capacity; partnering with trusted community leaders and organisations, embedding ICT in existing health or educational frameworks, ensuring sustainability beyond initial project funding. This South-South collaboration highlights ICTs relevance and adaptability in LMIC contexts. It reinforces the potential of community-led mental health practices to democratise care, foster resilience, and honour indigenous approaches to healing. ICT is also known as a brave space to be, to share, to learn, and between the francophones mostly called as espace de ecoute, parole et lien, space of listening, talking and bounding, or even circle space. That's probably one of the good lines that align to ICT and facilitate contact with people, who are often precariously looking for strategies to solve its injuries or even to take out the pebble in the shoes, that whoever is using the shoes, causing suffering, hurting, but doesn't impeach the walk of a journey, in the other hand need to be solved with strategies and good coping, nor just rid jagged and put aside.",

I also aim to share the applicability of some oils as per example the Citrus Oils - known for relieving stress, ansiedade, depressão and nervousness. It is clinically proven in studies that the citrus oils normalize endocrine hormone levels and immune function. In the wards, it helps to improve the physical, mental and emotional health of patients. highly complex mental disorders (example: borderline, bipolar disorder, depressão, severe cases of depressão, schizofrenia, eating disorders and etc) and its symptoms. Aromaterapia applied to mental health has been highlighted as an important therapeutic tool in the maintenance/recovery of health, well-being and qualidade de vida, with a positive and special impact on the tratamento of patients with Mental Disorders, from the mildest to the most severe, of greater complexity. The patients who receive Clinical Aromaterapia is heterogenous, with degrees of limitation and also some show emotional and cognitive loss. As a result, we can highlight: - the reduction in length of hospital stay - minimize side effects of traditional medication - greater adherence to the tratamento - balance emotions - support to socialization - reduce frequency of crises - support the capacity of facing new challenges and so on Clinical Aromaterapia is highly beneficial when integrated to severe and complex cases of Mental Health pathologies and also we notice that success is based on the broad participation of directors and supervisors as well as the perception of the multidisciplinary team that supports us and the professionals trained in practice.",

    "abstract": "The consolidation of Brazils National Policy on Integrative and Complementary Practices (PNPIC) in 2006 catalyzed the integration of holistic approaches into the Unified Health System (SUS), as demonstrated in the municipality of Benedito Novo  SC. With 10,520 inhabitants, the city gradually adopted integrative and complementary practices (PICs), reflecting a commitment to expanded care and health system comprehensiveness as a counterpoint to biomedical dominance. Yoga, originating from the Indian tradition, engages practitioners at physical, mental, emotional, energetic, and spiritual levels, aiming toward holistic self-integration. Hatha Yogaone of its branchesstrengthens both body and mind through the practice of postures (sanas), breathing techniques (prymas), concentration, and relaxation. Its benefits include stress reduction, regulation of the nervous and respiratory systems, sleep stabilization, enhancement of psychophysical vitality, hormonal balance, immune system strengthening, improved concentration and creativity, and mental re-educationall positively impacting mood and qualidade de vida. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends Yoga for integration into national health systems. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), an ancient medical system, emphasizes harmonious interrelationships among the bodys components. It is grounded in the YinYang theory, which categorizes the world into two complementary yet opposing principles, aiming to harmonize this duality (Brasil, 2006). This experience aimed to promote self-care among SUS users through the systematic introduction of Yoga, Acupuncture, Auriculoterapia, Reiki, and Aromaterapia. The goals included strengthening userprofessional bonds, enhancing shared responsibility, and reducing excessive medicalization. The implementation of PICs in Benedito Novo began in 2016 with Yoga offered in atenção primária groups, expanding to include auriculoterapia, acupuntura, Reiki, and aromaterapia from 2017 to the present, guided by both professional training and community demand. Activities took place in community and health center settings, following specific protocols: weekly 60-minute Yoga sessions; individual acupuntura and auriculoterapia consultations with prior assessments; Reiki sessions; and essential-oil use and art terapia in workshop settingseach conducted by trained professionals. The initiative involved atenção primária nurses trained in PICs and SUS users experiencing chronic conditions or mild-to-moderate psychological distress. Municipal administration provided infrastructure and institutional approval. All practices were voluntary and conducted ethically, adhering to the SUS principles of beneficence, autonomy, and non-maleficence, with activities recorded internally. Key challenges included the absence of clear local operational guidelines and insufficient specialized human resources. Traditional professional training hindered PIC acceptance, causing discontinuities and limited reach due to staff turnover and reliance on individual initiatives. Resistance from some healthcare professionalsparticularly physicians favoring purely pharmaceutical intervençãoswas observed. Financial sustainability presented a barrier, with no earmarked funding, reliance on volunteer labor, and difficulties sourcing supplies. Despite these challenges, PIC implementation led to subjective health improvements: decreased dor crônica, reduced ansiedade and depressão, improved sleep, and enhanced vitality. Strengthened bonds between professionals and users were observed, and the practices functioned as educational tools promoting autonomy and redefined care perspectives. Internal records noted fewer consultations for non-specific complaints and reduced use of anxiolytics and analgesics. Group testimonials indicated boosted self-esteem, well-being, and coping ability for chronic conditions. The objectives of promoting self-care, reinforcing userprofessional connection, and integrating PICs into atenção primária were largely fulfilled. In high-income countries where biomedical models predominate, integrative practices are gradually increasing, paralleled by growing scientific research. This scientific and institutional surge is driven by mass public demand, attributable to several factors: accessibility, dissatisfaction with impersonal, invasive, and iatrogenic biomedicine, appreciation for traditional medicines, and cultural movements advocating their validation (Tesser; Sousa; Nascimento, 2018). There is global consensus that Primary Health Care is the most appropriate setting for PICs, owing to several factors: 1) stimulation of self-healing potential, and 2) active patient participation in healing processes, enhanced by practitioner sensitivity to cultural and social contexts (WHO, 2002). The effective implementation of PICs requires institutional embedding in municipal policy frameworks, ongoing professional training, establishment of funded technical centers, and mixed-method impact evaluations. It is advisable to replicate the model elsewhere, build regional support networks, and conduct longitudinal studies assessing PICs impacts within SUS. This experience underscores the relevance of PICs as integral care tools, validating popular knowledge and individual agency and contributing to redefining healthcare practices in SUS.",

    "abstract": "As a consequence of a worldwide epigenetic tratamento following the Covid pandemic we saw an alarming number of patients suffering the consequences on mental, emotional and physical levels in a clinic for integrative medicine in downtown Barcelona. Motivation: The main motivation came from the patients suffering who found no answer in conventional medicine. Objective: The purpose of our endeavour was to restore the sick to health which is called healing. In circumstances when no clear guidelines were given from the international community. Chronological secrets: Patients started flocking into our clinic as soon as ten days after receiving the first or second dose of the epigenetic tratamento recommended by most governments. After attending international online conferences, we started in our team of 10 integrative medicine doctors to attend patients whos live had been one before the epigenetic tratamento and another (and sicker) after the epigenetic tratamento. To this date we still see minimum 1 patient per week affected by the intervenção. Materials and procedures: After taking each and individual case after however receiving the same impact we proceeding to develop a protocol for detoxifying intra- and extracellular agents with Zeolith and Solarvital (Solaris) over a period of 2-3 month. The greatest impact however was achieved by administering the potentized epigenetic material (Isopathy) versus the homeopathic preparation of Hottentotus tameles 30C, 200C, MK. Participants: we run a busy outpatient clinic in the centre of Barcelona with more or less 6000 patients attended by doctors, physiotherapists, midwifes, dietitians, body consciousness workers, kinesiologist etc. attending people from all ages and races. Theoretical framework: Hahnemann described in his writings that in each and every epidemy we have to search for the one agent for the genius epidemicus (Organon of homeopathic medicine). Ethical aspects: The patients who received our tratamento had either not looked for or not found any other tratamento available for the partly severe consequences of their tratamento. Since there were no official guidelines and only few international forums for sharing the results for obvious reasons. Results limitations: Integrative medicine and homeopatia in Spain is unfortunately not fully integrated into the saúde pública system. Only few private insurances companies cover for the expenses to be paid by the patients a) for the medicines and b) for the consultation. More than 150 patients could be helped to improve or cure their problems. Preliminary analysis: The homeopathic adjuvant was found to be more effected than the isopathic approach. Objective assessment: Even today (June 2025) the combination of this tratamento seems to be effective for the short- and long-term consequences of the epigenetic tratamento. Practical recommendations: After narrowing down the diagnosis of the many times surprising clinical features of patients that find no other explanations and have certain alterations in their blood analysis our protocol can be applied following the law of similar (Samuel Hahnemann) and the law of healing (C.Hering). Future directions: Sharing the findings on an international level with a group of doctors working with this protocol. Contribution to field: The experience of many of us shared after 2021, has not yet found a clear and international guideline for understanding the pathophysiological consequences of the epigenetic tratamento.",

    "abstract": "Contemporary medical education largely remains anchored in a biomedical paradigm, a model characterized by a mechanistic, fragmented, and disease-centered view of the human body. The sociologist Madel Luz critiques this hegemonic model as one specific \"medical rationality\" among many, which historically overshadowed other comprehensive systems of knowledge and practice (LUZ, 2005). The institutionalization of Traditional, Complementary, and Integrative Medicine (TCIM)  known as PICS in Brazil  through the National Policy (PNPIC, 2006) represents a profound political and epistemological challenge to this hegemony. It advocates for the integration of different medical rationalities to achieve \"integralidade\" (comprehensiveness), a core principle of the Brazilian Unified Health System (SUS). This report details the author's experience, first as a student and then as a tutor, within the TCIM discipline at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ), a journey of transition from a purely biomedical viewpoint to an integrative and critical perspective on health, as discussed by Tesser and Sousa (2018). This relato de experiência aims to: 1) analyze the dual role of student-tutor as a pedagogical locus of reflection; 2) deepen the analysis of the TCIM-Primary Health Care (PHC) interface as a site of practice and resistance; and 3) discuss the pedagogical strategies and epistemological challenges in decolonizing the medical curriculum. Methods: This report is based on a qualitativo analysis of the author's experience and observations during remote weekly debates held throughout 2023. The methodology involved a critical, multidisciplinary exegesis of scientific articles, public policies, and theoretical texts on TCIM. This process fostered a reflective analysis of the tensions between different knowledge systems within medical training. Results and Discussion: Three interconnected analytical axes emerged, revealing the discipline's transformative potential. Decolonization and the Ecology of Knowledges: The course functions as a laboratory for what the sociologist Boaventura de Sousa Santos calls an \"ecology of knowledges.\" This concept proposes moving beyond \"abyssal thinking\"the Western tendency to relegate non-scientific knowledge to a space of non-existence. Instead, it fosters a dialogue where ancestral wisdom (e.g., herbalism, Amazonian shamanism) and other medical rationalities are recognized as legitimate, promoting \"cognitive justice\" (SANTOS, 2007). This directly confronts the colonial legacy within medicine, which systematically discredited and suppressed traditional healing practices. Strengthening Integrality in Primary Health Care: The synergy between TCIM and PHC is profound. While the biomedical model provides essential tools for acute conditions, TCIM offers technologies of care that enhance the core attributes of PHC. Practices like acupuntura, meditação, and therapeutic touch provide new avenues for managing dor crônica, mental health, and stress-related conditions. As argued by Tesser (2009), they enrich the therapeutic encounter, improve the clinician-patient relationship, and strengthen longitudinality and comprehensiveness (integralidade), responding to dimensions of human suffering that often elude a purely biological diagnosis. Curricular Resistance and the Hidden Curriculum: The explicit curriculum of the discipline was often met with resistance from some students, a phenomenon that can be understood through the concept of the \"hidden curriculum.\" Medical training implicitly socializes students to value high-tech, hospital-based, and specialist-driven medicine, while often devaluing PHC, generalist practice, and low-cost care technologies (LUZ, 2015). This ingrained value system creates resistance to TCIM, which is often misperceived as \"unscientific\" or \"soft.\" Overcoming this requires not just presenting evidence, but creating pedagogical spaces for students to critically reflect on the historical and political construction of medical \"truth.\" The TCIM discipline at UFRJ is far more than an add-on; it is a critical space for curricular decolonization and for training physicians who are more reflective, critical, and aligned with the founding principles of the SUS. The dual experience as a student and tutor underscores that integrating these practices is an ongoing epistemological struggle that challenges the very foundations of medical colonialism. To truly advance integrative care, it is imperative to expand such initiatives and create structural changes in the medical curriculum that normalize and value a true ecology of health knowledges.",

    "abstract": "Restorative Yoga uses supportive props to promote relaxation through adapted Hatha Yoga postures held for extended periods (5-20 minutes). Integrated into cancer care, Restorative Yoga alleviates muscular and joint tension, improves breathing, and supports restoration. This report describes the free, volunteer-based Restorative Yoga program at ZENCancer Institute over seven years, aimed at enhancing well-being in oncology patients via accessible integrative care. The ZENCancer Institute (IZC) is a nonprofit organization that emerged after its founder experienced breast cancer and sought Traditional, Complementary and Integrative Medicine (TCIM) together with chemoterapia tratamento, with the aim of reducing stress, strengthening the immune system and improving qualidade de vida. Currently, IZC supports over 400 cancer patients across 11 Brazilian states and internationally, including participants from Portugal. Originally offered in person in a space provided by its founder in Rio de Janeiro (year 2018), the Restorative Yoga program expanded considerably when it shifted to an online model during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, when it was necessary the adapt due to social distancing. In 2021 Restorative Yoga was offered online four times a week. And in June 2022, in person practices were resumed and online practices were maintained. Currently, Restorative Yoga sessions run regularly in person at two Rio de Janeiro locations and one in Jundiaí (SP), lasting 90 minutes, and online twice weekly for 60 minutes. Restorative Yoga at the ZENCancer Institute was originally designed to support cancer patients in coping with common side effects of tratamento, including fatigue, ansiedade, muscle and joint pain, and sleep disturbances. By encouraging deep rest through supported postures and conscious stillness, the practice helps regulate the nervous system, ease physical discomfort, and foster emotional resilience. As the program expanded, it began to include individuals experiencing chronic stress, emotional exhaustion, and persistent pain unrelated to cancer. Today, the practice addresses a broad spectrum of biopsychosocial challenges, offering a therapeutic resource for those navigating illness, caregiving, or the cumulative pressures of everyday life. From March 2022 to August 2023, and in October 2024, a participant survey were carried out in order to assess their experience of practicing Restorative Yoga at the IZC, with guiding questions about the type of practice, the perceived benefits, positive points, discomfort, among others, and their suggestions and comments demonstrate that we are on the right track and that the model developed by the IZC is capable of providing socialization and a sense of belonging to a community, both in person and online, helping participants to experience the challenges present at any stage of cancer tratamento in a lighter and calmer way, feeling welcomed and welcoming to each other. During the period of social distancing, in which the transition from the in-person to the online modality took place, important challenges were presented for offering the practice of Restorative Yoga, highlighting the need to enhance the instructors' skills in giving the verbal commands of the advanced postures, due to the impossibility of hands-on adjustments, as occurs in the in-person format, which was solved by instructor training. Another difficult was patients limited access to standard yoga props at home. To maintain continuity, the institutes founder assembled and distributed restorative kits  including eye pillows and lavender spray  to previous in-person participants. Instructors encouraged use of common household items such as pillows, blankets, towels, and books, revealing that minimal resources still yield meaningful benefits. The shift also increased engagement, attracting new volunteers and participants from diverse regions and tratamento stages. Postures were adapted for bed-based practice to ensure accessibility. Importantly, a virtual support network spontaneously formed between volunteers and patients, fostering emotional connection and solidarity during social isolation. Key recommendations include adaptable protocols for both online and in-person formats, instructor training in verbal cueing, and encouraging use of accessible household props. Expanding access to caregivers and those with chronic stress has strengthened the programs impact.",

    "abstract": "Tuina terapia is a more than 3,000-year-old therapeutic massage technique that manipulates meridian points to optimize the bodys energy flow. Tuina has multiple demonstrated benefits in modulating blood flow, improving recovery after sports injuries, decreasing inflammation, improving joint mobility, and mitigating dor crônica. As a central component of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), Tuina has been demonstrated to be a safe and effective alternative to physioterapia in management of chronic nonspecific low back pain, and potentially superior in other conditions including knee osteoarthritis. Despite these benefits, Tuina faces multiple barriers to widespread adoption in mainstream healthcare, including poor awareness of Tuinas benefits and a deficit of available practitioners. To address these barriers, Expert Manipulative Massage Automation (EMMA) robotic massagers are being used to improve access to Tuina services. EMMA is a robotic massage device that uses Artificial Intelligence to identify areas of muscular stiffness to deliver Tuina terapia and may represent a safe and effective modality to extend the availability of Tuina massage beyond its current capabilities. Previous work at Mayo Clinic has demonstrated that use of EMMA is safe, effective, acceptable, and well tolerated, and we believe that it may be a valuable tool for widespread dissemination of Tuina as a tratamento modality. We are currently conducting a randomized controlled trial comparing the feasibility and efficacy of robotically administered Tuina terapia via EMMA to massage received from a certified massage therapist. Study resultados will include satisfação do paciente, pain intensity and pain interference with daily activities as measured through Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) scales. Previous studies have demonstrated satisfação do paciente with robot-administered Tuina massage and we believe that EMMA is a safe and effective modality to expand access to Tuina terapia. By conducting this randomized controlled trial, we hope to gain further insights into the efficacy and tolerability of EMMA as compared to certified massage terapia. We hope that this continues to enhance the popularity of Tuina as an effective tratamento modality for the tratamento of lower back pain. EMMA, an AI-enabled, adaptive robotic massage therapeutic device, provides a safe and feasible option to extend the capabilities of Tuina providers, thereby improving access to an effective Traditional Chinese Medicine modality.

    "abstract": "Abstract Learning from the beginning the importance of dialogue between traditional and scientific knowledge, and the development of both, the Phytoterapia monitors were able to experience one of the greatest examples of traditional knowledge in the region: buying herbs from a herbalist. Thus, this work is an relato de experiência by monitors from the Federal University of Paraíba about this experience. Descrição Phytoterapia is a therapeutic resource that uses medicinal plants in various pharmaceutical preparations. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), fitoterapia, as part of traditional medicine, is widely used worldwide. Although it faces challenges, particularly regarding regulation, the WHO is committed to overcoming them by integrating these traditional medicines into the national health systems of member countries, establishing quality standards, and promoting research and the training of specialized professionals. In Brazil, although the use of fitoterapia is strongly linked to traditional knowledge, scientific interest in this practice continues to grow. The diversity of plants and low cost make this terapia highly attractive for healthcare programs and professionals, contributing to its strengthening within the Unified Health System (SUS). Moreover, the success of this therapeutic approach among the population is largely due to the cultural roots of this practice, guided by healers, midwives, and herbalists. Public markets and street fairs are common settings in many Brazilian cities. They not only provide a space for purchasing food and generating income but also preserve a variety of traditions that develop through interpersonal interactions. Herbalists, as they are known, typically make a living by selling medicinal plants and spices and are quite popular in these places. These individuals often possess practical knowledge about the identification, harvesting, preparation, and use of plants to treat illnesses. Some have inherited this knowledge from their ancestors and are involved in the entire process, from cultivation to commercialization (Araujo et al., 2014). Phytoterapia is a tratamento modality where the therapeutic active constituents come from plants or plant derivatives. In Brazil, it is included in the Unified Health System under the scope of Integrative and Complementary Health Practices (Brazil, 2006). This allows, for example, a reduction in the use of allopathic medicines, offering a better cost-benefit ratio for users, in addition to being a deeply rooted practice due to sociocultural, economic, and historical development. At the Federal University of Paraíba (UFPB), the Herbal Medicine course is offered to various health-related programs (Nursing, Physical Therapy, Speech Therapy, Nutrition, Dentistry, Biomedicine, Medicine, and Occupational Therapy). The Herbal Medicine monitoring program has some unique aspects, as the monitor is constantly in contact with both scientific and acadêmico knowledge as well as traditional knowledge. Thus, they learn to bridge the gap between these two forms of knowledge, which is the core of this work. The monitor has access to various opportunities, ranging from deepening expertise in a specific field to assisting other students and experiencing everyday teaching situations. This work reports the experience of Herbal Medicine monitors from the Federal University of Paraíba during 2025, when they visited the Central Public Market of João Pessoa/PB. The purpose of the visit was to purchase medicinal plants from a herbalist to supply the Herbal Medicine laboratory. The visit took place on February, 2025, with the participation of a professor and two monitors. For one of the monitors, the initial impression was of an environment filled with different aromas and a variety of stimuli, leaving her momentarily disoriented. Although she knew herbalists offered various plants, she also noticed the presence of spices and fruits. The herbs were organized in large sacks or stacked, tied with plastic strips. While an employee assisted the professor, she observed the interactions between people and the herbalist. Customers reporting their symptoms showed a high degree of trust in the sellers recommendations, recognizing him as a true holder of knowledge. For the other monitor, what stood out most was how the herbs were separated into portions without labels. The herbalist could identify the plants at a glance, naming them and describing their properties. This made the monitor realize that she was used to recognizing herbs only by labels on laboratory bottles and that she could also use aspects like smell, color, and texture, just as the herbalist did. This experience led her to value the organoleptic and botanical aspects of herbs in her practice, a lesson she intends to share with other students during her monitoring. Monitoring, as an educational practice in higher education, seeks to facilitate the teaching-learning process, allowing students to deepen their knowledge and experience teaching, both at the university and in real-life situations. The monitors realized that the guidance of herbalists aligns with scientific knowledge, demonstrating that traditional knowledge, has its foundations and serves as a basis for scientific research.",

    "abstract": "Family Constellation (FC), internationally known as Familienstellen, is a systemic therapeutic approach aimed at promoting awareness and transforming individuals' internal posture, thereby fostering autonomy in emotional and behavioral decision-making processes. This practice is based on the premise that individuals are intrinsically connected to their family systems, and that unresolved conflicts within these systems may manifest in various forms, such as relational difficulties, physical illness, emotional blockages, and psychosocial traumas. In the field of healthcare, FC is understood as a light technology, as it emphasizes care centered on listening, subjectivity, and expanding relational awareness. Recently recognized as an Integrative and Complementary Health Practice (PICS) by Brazil's Unified Health System (SUS), FC has officially been included within the scope of nursing practice, as stipulated by COFEN Resolution No. 739/2024. This institutional recognition opens space for its inclusion in both care and educational practices within the context of comprehensive healthcare. However, there remains significant lack of awareness about FC among healthcare professionals, as well as resistance related to its legitimacy and clinical applicability. In light of this scenario, an educational initiative was conducted during the Nursing Week promoted by the Regional Nursing Council of Rio Grande do Sul (COREN-RS), with the aim of demystifying Family Constellation among nursing professionals, broadening their understanding of its application, and encouraging qualification in the field of integrative practices. The activity consisted of an introductory lecture followed by a practical workshop, engaging approximately 50 participants. The objective was to demystify the topic of CF belonging to PICS, which is still not widely known as a mediator of problems and facilitator of self-contemplation, reaching a specific audience of professionals with the potential to become replicators and enthusiasts of the topic. During the activity, several challenges were identified. The main obstacle was prejudice toward FC, often associated with esoteric or unscientific practices. This perception generated initial resistance among some participants, reinforcing the need for educational strategies to legitimize it as a valid care practice. Additionally, the absence of a fully adequate environmentin terms of silence and privacypartially compromised the quality of the experience. A lack of specific training on the topic among participants was also noted, along with a shortage of accessible educational materials and scientific references in Portuguese, which hindered the deepening of the content presented. Despite these challenges, the results were significantly positive. The experience elicited a variety of emotional responses from participants, including the desire for physical contact (hugging), feelings of bitterness, empathy, sadness, and joy. The testimonials highlighted the impact of the dynamic in sensitizing professionals and demonstrated FC's capacity to provoke deep self-reflection and interpersonal awareness. By the end of the activity, many participants expressed interest in pursuing further training in PICS, particularly in Family Constellation, as a strategy to broaden their therapeutic repertoire and implement more integrative care practices. The experience demonstrated that FC can be understood as a powerful light technology, fostering self-care, sensitive listening, and the re-signification of emotional suffering. Its application in continuing education spaces, dialogue circles, and therapeutic workshops proved feasible and effective, both for strengthening professional practice and for humanizing healthcare delivery. Based on the resultados obtained, it is recommended that similar educational activities be expanded within healthcare and educational institutions, and that FC-related content be included in nursing education curricula. It is also suggested to encourage national scientific production on the topic to generate robust evidence supporting its legitimacy within the health field. Developing accessible educational materials and adaptable clinical protocols for health service contexts is also essential for its practical implementation. Furthermore, raising awareness among managers and multidisciplinary teams is crucial to strengthen the institutional recognition of FC as an integrative and humanized care strategy. Additionally, it is recommended to promote the training of nurses as qualified facilitators, capable of conducting FC practices with ethics, technical rigor, and responsibility. In conclusion, the reported experience contributes to advancing knowledge about integrative practices in nursing and reinforces the role of health professionals in delivering care that is sensitive to the emotional and relational dimensions of human experience. In this context, Family Constellation emerges as a promising tool for promoting health, valuing subjectivity, and fostering more balanced and healthier relationships in both care delivery and health management.",

    "abstract": "Based on the National Policy on Integrative and Complementary Practices and in view of the National Curriculum Guidelines for Medical Courses from a comprehensive training perspective, it is urgent to provide students with experiences aligned with these horizons. Possibilities were developed for the creation of a new course at the Faculty of Medicine of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro that addresses Integrative and Complementary Health Practices using active methodologies. The course ran from March 2020 to January 2025. The course began with a challenge that none of us had ever experienced before: the new Coronavirus pandemic. This report aims to describe the process of creating the elective course Introduction to Traditional Medicines and PICS and to reflect on the experiences of students and teachers involving the protagonism that was necessary in this teaching-learning process. In Brazil, PICS was marked by the publication of the National Policy in 2006, which emphasizes their inclusion in Primary Health Care, contributing to the increased resolvability of the system with continuous, humanized, and comprehensive care (BRAZIL, 2006). In this sense, with regard to the university, the premise of the PICS approach in undergraduate health courses arises, in order to create learning opportunities related to this field of knowledge for students. The reforms of the Pedagogical Political Projects of Medical Schools, based on the 2014 National Curriculum Guidelines (DCNs), became urgent in order to enable the necessary transformations. At that time, there was already recognition of the need to mobilize different areas of knowledge and healthcare technologies, since there are different types of complexity regarding health problems (BRASIL, 2014). Undergraduate studies are a privileged moment for exposing students to experiences and knowledge about the health-disease process and the doctor-patient relationship, as well as social and cultural dimensions. In this context, it was important to promote coordination and integration among medical students at different stages of the course, starting in the third semester, since this could contribute to the training of professionals capable of ensuring quality health actions and services for the population (VIEIRA, 2016). Twenty-five places were made available for undergraduate students in the Medicine course at UFRJ. As a theoretical framework, the novelty of knowledge of Complementary and Integrative Traditional Medicines and their different Medical Rationalities that support them emerges. The presentation of Integrative and Complementary Health Practices, its current legislation with an emphasis on transdisciplinarity and the humanization of care, allowed for an expansion of scientific knowledge. The challenging moment of the COVID-19 pandemic brought reflections on social isolation and student demands. In this context, teachers identified the urgency of new perspectives to deal with an uncertain future and the need to choose tools that promote self-knowledge and a way of being in healthcare. The theoretical framework and selected experiences contributed to the intention to mitigate ansiedade and raise awareness during this period. For immersion in the PICS theme, emergency activities were initially carried out remotely during this period of the pandemic, addressing topics such as Mindfulness, Music Therapy, and Yoga. In a second phase, starting in August 2021, practical PICS workshops were held in person with interactive roundtables, enabling student participation and motivation, thus allowing them to learn about and experience PICS in different types of care. The visit to the Thematic Collection of Medicinal Plants at the Rio de Janeiro Botanical Garden provided successful experiences with the possibility of learning about certified medicinal plant species, culminating in a collective Tai Chi Chuan practice and group social gathering. The challenges that motivated the creation of the course included the recognition of the institution's traditional medical training and the need to fill this gap, ensuring access to the scientific knowledge and evidence of TCMI/PICS. During the Covid-19 pandemic, the experience allowed for a teaching-learning process that valued lightness, self-care, and self-knowledge. The content presented in an interactive way provided students with information about tools in this regard. They emphasized that the practices were adopted in their daily routine, increasing their well-being and self-knowledge and reducing ansiedade, allowing for a comprehensive and sensitive approach. The novelty of the creation of the elective course Introduction to Traditional Medicines and PICS at the UFRJ School of Medicine allowed future medical professionals access to scientific knowledge and evidence of TCMI/PICS, providing a more comprehensive and holistic education. The UFRJ School of Medicine is an institution that presents gaps and resistance in the use of medical rationalities that differ from biomedical logic. There is an urgent need to expand teaching, care, and research spaces for medicines based on different traditions. It is possible for them to participate in a common institutional field. The experience of introducing the elective course on PICS into the UFRJ Medicine Course has proven successful and promising in this expansion, considering the relevance of a compulsory course in the course curriculum.",

    "abstract": "This report addresses teaching and learning experiences in the field of Integrative and Complementary Health Practices (PICS) for students at the Faculty of Medicine of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ). The objective was to describe experiences related to the practice of medicinal gardening at a Family Clinic. Educational activities were carried out in Primary Health Care (PHC) in the municipality of Rio de Janeiro between 2013 and 2025. The setting for the experience was the Assis Valente Family Clinic located in the Ilha do Governador neighbourhood in the municipality of Rio de Janeiro, which had seven Family Health (SF) teams, three Oral Health teams, a Senior Citizens' Centre and a Carioca Health Academy. The territory consisted of the Vila Joaniza and Barbante communities, with a total of 24,000 residents. It should be noted that this clinic is certified as a Medicinal Plant Friendly Unit. In 2013, medical students were introduced to Integrative and Complementary Practices (PICS) at the clinic, where there was a medicinal garden. The subjects of the experiment were third-year students and interns from the UFRJ School of Medicine and three teachers (a phytotherapist, a homeopath and a saúde pública nurse), the Family Health team, the Family Health Support Centre (NASF), users and professionals, including an agricultural technician. The decision to expose students to pedagogical experiences with the Family Health teams was based on the understanding that primary healthcare should be a training ground for SUS professionals and a differentiator in terms of ensuring relevant experiences for the training of competent doctors with skills to care for the populations of the territories. In 2017, the immersion of third-year students in the Family Clinic enabled their inclusion in PICS activities. At that time, the unit was already a practice field for the Integrated Internship in Family and Community Medicine at the UFRJ medical school. In partnership with the health team and NASF, the activities of the elderly group in managing the medicinal plant garden were intensified. The students actively participated in the practices: workshops with the participation of users; botanical identification; production of seedlings from seeds and cuttings; preparation of seasonings with fresh herbs, aromatic vinegar, homemade syrup, and handmade medicinal soap. The themes were: medicinal plants in pain management, respiratory symptoms, sleep, therapeutic teas, and involved festivities such as Easter and June festivals. The botanical identification workshop promoted the appreciation of the participants' affective memory and experience through the exchange of knowledge. The workshops allowed for reflection on the experiences, strengthening the bonds and connections between the parties. The users' knowledge and the sharing of the students' experiences, resulting from the scientific knowledge described in scientific publications, became a reality. Through the portfolio, it was possible to follow the reports and reflections of the third-year students in relation to their experiences. At the boarding school, the Field Diary, Final Report and Thematic Work were used to record the activities. The visit to the Thematic Collection of Medicinal Plants at the Rio de Janeiro Botanical Garden was the highlight of the shared experiences, with the opportunity to learn about certified medicinal plant species and participate in a collective Tai Chi Chuan practice led by a PICS teacher. There was a group get-together. The main difficulties encountered were resistance to mobilising staff, students and users for continuous action, facing the fragility of PICS insertion in Family Health. The main lessons learned were the enhancement of dialogue between teachers, students, NASF professionals and users, enabling the strengthening of PICS in PHC; the expansion of the insertion of medical students. in the ESF, enabling the construction of teaching-learning experiences within the scope of PICS and promoting contact between students and users' narratives about medicinal plants, with a view to learning about local culture. Pathways are suggested for replicating and improving the internship through the creation of disciplines and curricular arrangements capable of enabling practices that produce future doctors capable of perceiving the needs of users, with a less reductionist and fragmented view.",

    "abstract": "In a stricto sensu postgraduate program at a university in the greater São Paulo area, the Integrative Health discipline, which addresses the integration between conventional and non-conventional medicine, proves to be a transformative experience for students. During classes, they develop a broad understanding of healthcare, recognizing the importance of individuals' physical, emotional, and socioeconomic aspects. Adopting this new perspective mirrors the core idea of integrative medicine: moving past the conventional framework to foster a more holistic, person-centered way of caring. This approach promotes dialogue between different knowledge and practices, prioritizing person-centered care. During the course, students are introduced to various complementary and alternative therapies, including Traditional Chinese Medicine, Meditation, and Homeopathy, among others formally recognized by the Sistema Único de Saúde (Brazilian Unified Health System). This exposure encourages students to critically examine the relevance and efficiency of these therapies in the current health landscape. Students frequently reflected on the importance of self-knowledge and different approaches to care, highlighting their impact on professional practice. Many of them report that this knowledge enhanced their professional outlook, providing a distinct advantage in the job market, where this aspect is often lacking. Reflection on personal limitations, self-care, and active, humanized listening emerge as valuable tools for developing more empathetic and welcoming professionals. Among the key reflections shared by students is the critical importance of both interdisciplinarity and multidisciplinarity, considered essential for effective integrative health practices. Sharing learning experiences with peers from diverse fields  including medicine, biomedicine, psychology, nursing, dentistry, nutrition, engineering, law, and administration  enriches the understanding of care, fostering a more collaborative and comprehensive approach. Interaction across different areas expands and strengthens relationships and perceptions, directly impacting the quality of professional practice. Despite extensive discussion of holistic approaches and multidisciplinary care concepts, a gap exists in implementing these principles in direct patient care. This disconnection hinders the effective integration of conventional practices with complementary therapies, creating a hierarchical structure related to the quality of integrative and conventional practices. To bridge this gap, fostering stronger partnerships between educational institutions and health services is crucial. Implementing specific collaboration guidelines tailored to the context can facilitate the integration of theory and practice, offering students opportunities to apply theoretical knowledge in real clinical settings. This approach reinforces student comprehension and improves care quality, promoting a more cohesive and effective professional practice. Including practical activities, such as internships and extension projects focused on integrative health, significantly contributes to student training, allowing theory to be applied in real scenarios and contextualized with the reality of health units. In summary, the Integrative Health discipline is crucial for developing technical and human skills. Health education becomes more comprehensive when it integrates different dimensions of care, including integrative practices, enabling professionals to work effectively in increasingly complex contexts. This increasingly highlights the need for the discipline to be included in professional training.",

    "abstract": "Floral Therapy was incorporated into Brazils National Policy on Integrative and Complementary Health Practices (PNPIC) in 2018. Based on the work of Dr. Edward Bach, this terapia aims to promote emotional balance and qualidade de vida through the individualized selection of flower essences. These essences are highly diluted natural liquid extracts, typically derived from flowers, plants, or shrubs, and are used to support self-care by restoring mental and emotional equilibrium.This report describes the implementation and evolution of online Floral Therapy at the ZENCancer Institute (IZC) since 2020. The ZENCancer Institute (IZC) was founded in 2018, inspired by the personal journey of its founder, who experienced the benefits of Traditional, Complementary and Integrative Medicine (TCIM) during cancer tratamento. Since then, the institute has expanded its offerings both in-person and online, providing a range of practices including Floral Therapy, meditação, Reiki, art terapia, and yoga. Floral Therapy sessions were initially conducted in person in Rio de Janeiro and transitioned to an online format via video calls in May 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The program is supported by a team of 14 volunteer therapists and consists of 12 sessions, with the option to extend for an additional 6 sessions when needed. Up to three family members or caregivers per patient may also receive terapia. After each session, personalized essence recommendations are sent via WhatsApp, and the essences are purchased by the participant from a compounding pharmacy of their choice, and this cost is borne by the participant. Floral Therapy at the IZC has primarily been used to support individuals experiencing emotional challenges such as fear, ansiedade, and insecurity  common among those undergoing cancer tratamento. These states often arise in response to illness-related stress and emotional vulnerability. At IZC, Floral Therapy has been integrated into care pathways as a supportive strategy for emotional well-being. The continued demand for and engagement with the practice points to its perceived relevance and resonance among participants. The digitalization of various health and wellness services offers some advantages such as convenience, cost-efetividade, availability and, above all, accessibility, which allows IZC to serve participants in 16 states in Brazil, even in other countries such as Portugal and the United States. A relevant challenge to highlight is the fact that not all participants have easy access to flower essences, either for financial reasons or because the essences indicated for their tratamento are not available in their locality. Therefore, the group has been seeking successful partnerships with pharmacies, suppliers and flower system creators in order to minimize this challenge. In addition, other possibilities have been evaluated, such as the manipulation of florals by volunteer therapists, but the logistics of delivering the formulas must be considered. All these factors are being considered in the IZC's and the flower terapia center's tireless quest to enable oncology patients to access the benefits of TCIM which, in the context of floral terapia, can be used in a integrative and complementary way to the medical tratamento received by the participant, and does not replace the conventional tratamento, and helping to improve the qualidade de vida of these patients.",

    "abstract": "Integrative Pharmacy is a focus at Farol Social Business that aims to expand the role of pharmacists in promoting health and preventing diseases, through guidance on the rational use of medicinal plants by the population, in order to integrate Farols pharmacists, health professionals and the community in the region. It connects conventional pharmaceutical care with traditional and popular knowledge based on scientific evidence that brings efficacy and segurança to people. This action promotes a powerful space for community articulation, healthcare and the appreciation of popular knowledge. In a territory marked by social vulnerabilities, educational actions of this magnitude carried out in a network enable the recovery of autonomy in care and promote the strengthening of territorial ties. It is also important to note that the Brazilian universal care system (SUS) recognizes the use of the traditional uses of medicinal plants as one of its recognized and accepted by the national Integrative Health Policy (BRASIL, 2006). From the first half of 2024 onwards, several activities were carried out in the territory, such as: Community medicinal garden maintenance - actions carried out at the Farol Educational Medicinal Garden, aimed at the cultivation and management of medicinal plants, providing information on basic concepts for care at home or in other spaces, addressing topics on soil preparation, planting methods, harvesting and different therapeutic uses. Technical support for the vegetables garden Horta Cores e Sabores and revitalization at the medicinal garden at the local public heath center UBS Jardim Lídia - aiming to expand, recover and renew the existing planting on site, highlighting the importance of biodiversity, species identification, maintenance and improvement of soil quality for the healthy development of plants. Tea Circles - educational gatherings focusing on medicinal plants which provided information on the medicinal properties of plants, parts used, interactions with medications, efeitos adversos, indications for use and the different ways of preparing teas, according to the resolutions of the National Pharmaceutical Council (CFF, 2007) in addition to thematic workshops integrated with SUS monitoring groups, such as: smoking, diabetes and mental health. Medicinal plants have always been widely used by the Capão Redondo community, being in many cases the first or only therapeutic alternative available, especially for the most vulnerable populations. However, in some cases, the frequent use of certain species, improper forms of use, associations of many species in homemade preparations that compromised people's therapeutic segurança were observed. Through interactions with the community, it was possible to raise awareness among more and more people about the importance of nature in all aspects of health. The approach to the rational use of plants promoted greater awareness about their use, expanding the population's knowledge about how to manage their self-care safely. It was observed that the educational process minimizes ansiedade attacks in groups from the Psychosocial Care Center, as it reduced the number of cigarettes smoked during the activity, in addition to promoting focus, concentration and collective integration in the spaces. One of the main challenges of Integrative Pharmacy is the limitations present in many professional training courses, which still do not include a broader view of healthcare. This hinders the development of integrated and interprofessional practices. In addition, there is resistance to the appreciation of traditional knowledge, which compromises the integration between popular and scientific knowledge. The articulation between different health professionals is also a challenge, requiring more consolidated spaces for collective construction. Added to this are the cultural and social barriers related to trust in terapia with medicinal plants, as well as the need for greater dissemination of positive experiences already carried out in the territories.",

    "abstract": "Capão Redondo, located in São Paulos southern outskirts, faces high social vulnerability, including limited access to healthcare, education, and employment. Historically, the community has relied on collective organizing  such as mothers clubs and housing movements  to address structural challenges. The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated mental health struggles, highlighting the need for accessible, non-stigmatizing intervençãos. Farol Saúde Integrativa, a social enterprise, introduced integrative community terapia (ICT) circles a Brazilian-origin complementary health practice (PICS) (BARRETO, 2018)  to provide emotional support and foster mutual aid considering that ICT is one of the Complementary and Integrative Health Practices (PICS) recognized and accepted by the national Integrative Health Policy (BRASIL, 2006). Sessions were held at Farols headquarters and two public primary healthcare units (UBS Jardim Lídia and UBS Maracá), chosen for their accessibility and community trust. The project engaged low-income adults, predominantly women of Northeastern Brazilian migrant descent, many of whom were caregivers experiencing chronic stress, grief, and socio economic hardships. The terapia circles aimed to address several critical challenges faced by the Capão Redondo community. Many participants had never sought mental health support due to enduring cultural stigma, which often discourages open discussions about emotional struggles. Social isolation was another key issue, particularly among women caregivers, who reported feeling overwhelmed by their responsibilities while having few opportunities for self-care. Systemic vulnerabilitiessuch as limited access to stable housing, education, and employmentfurther compounded stress and health disparities. Additionally, grief and trauma emerged as recurring themes, with participants sharing experiences of loss tied to community violence and the struggles of aging. The community terapia circles fostered a welcoming environment that reduced mental health stigma, encouraging participantsprimarily women caregiversto openly share their struggles. Despite low male attendance, the sessions promoted growing awareness of mental healths importance. Most participants were new to this practice, yet all described the experience as deeply impactful, with no resistance observed during sessions. Many expressed interest in returning, underscoring the communitys need for emotional support. The circles strengthened social bonds, cultivating solidarity and a sense of belonging. Participants reported reduced ansiedade and depressão symptoms, improved emotional resilience, and the adoption of collective self-care practices. Key concerns raised included caregiver burnout (particularly among women with limited autonomy) and grief related to local violence or aging. By integrating with the local saúde pública system (SUS), the initiative also contributed to more humanized healthcare approaches. Overall, the circles enhanced community awareness of mental health and integrative practices, empowering individuals to address challenges collectively. Only about 25% of the vacancies offered were occupied by the participants due to challenges posed by the cultural stigma regarding mental health. The participants were also overwhelmingly women, which also demonstrates that men are also less likely to seek mental healthcare. To sustain and expand the initiatives impact, targeted outreach efforts should engage more men through community leaders and tailored messaging, while stronger institutional support could ensure long-term viability. Training additional facilitators and documenting the programs long-term resultados through research would further legitimize the practice, attract funding, and enable replication in other vulnerable communities.",

    "abstract": "This is a descriptive report on an auriculoterapia training course for Portuguese nurses. This type of study describes an innovative experience involving training that is widespread in the context of Brazilian nursing but still rare in Portugal. The focus of the experience is research, given that the training is part of a thesis project that aims to develop guidelines for training in auriculoterapia, based on WHO benchmarks. It should be noted that there are no guidelines with recommendations for writing relato de experiências; however, we chose to follow the assumptions for the preparation of relato de experiências as scientific knowledge proposed by Mussi, Flores, and Almeida. The experience took place at the Order of Nurses (OE) in Coimbra, Portugal, in January and February 2025, during acadêmico mobility at the Coimbra Higher School of Nursing (ESEnfC). Informative and dialogical description was the type of analysis used, considering that this was an unprecedented training linked to a research stage. The main document guiding acupuntura training is the WHO Benchmarks for the Training of Acupuncture, developed by the World Health Organization (WHO) with the collaboration of more than 50 global experts. This document defines training categories, content complexity levels, and a curriculum that integrates the fundamentals of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) with basic health disciplines. Of particular note is the recognition of the multidisciplinary nature of acupuntura, evidenced by the proposed curricular differentiation for biomedical professionals, practitioners of traditional medicine, and individuals without biomedical training. Auriculoterapia, a practice within the scope of acupuntura, can be learned independently through open courses, reinforcing its multidisciplinary nature. Nursing, whose practice is centered on care, can benefit from auriculoterapia as a tool that promotes professional autonomy. In Brazil, COFEN Resolution No. 739/2024 recognizes auriculoterapia as training via free courses, recommending a minimum of 80 hours, while defining acupuntura as a specialization with at least 360 hours of training. Auriculoterapia is performed by nurses in a significant way. Portugal does not develop training for nurses in auriculoterapia, but there is interest in this type of training, considering the trend toward a more complex care model. Thus, the experience of developing training in auriculoterapia for nurses working in Portugal was fundamental in fostering discussions that are still incipient in the country. The project received financial support from the Rio Grande do Sul State Research Support Foundation (FAPERGS) under grant number 04/2024, grant agreement number 24/2551-0001824-7, enabling the proposed training program to go ahead. This is a collective training program developed with nurses working in Portugal who have no previous training in auriculoterapia, these being the inclusion criteria. The class was composed of 19 nurses, intentionally invited by a professor from ESEnfC to participate in the training. Considering the learning objectives, the course was divided into six modules (five theoretical and one practical). The teaching materials used were adapted from the extension course promoted by the Extension Program #SUStentaPICS (School of Nursing and Collective Health - UFRGS); State Department of Health of RS (Technical Area of PICS) entitled Professional qualification in PICS: auriculoterapia. The course was adapted following the proposed guidelines for training nurses in auriculoterapia/auricular acupuntura. The course had an online theoretical stage, via UFRGS Moodle, and a practical stage in person at the OE in Coimbra, Portugal. The course was taught by two nurses with training in free auriculoterapia courses. The materials for the practical class were donated and delivered to the 19 nurses participating in the course. In the practical stage, the OE auditorium space was used. The tables and chairs were arranged in a circle to encourage constant dialogue among the nurses. Four days of practical classes were organized, according to the acadêmico mobility period, on January 30, February 13, 20, and 27, from 1:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m., totaling 20 hours of practice. Due to health service availability, not all nurses were present on all days of practical classes, with a minimum of 5 hours required for certification. Thus, with the nurses who participated on February 13 and 20 (10 hours of practice), the training was based on biomedicine, reflexology, and TCM. For the group that participated only on February 27 (5 hours of practice), the approach focused on biomedicine and reflexology. As a teaching strategy for locating auricular points, a silicone ear model and pins were used, with location on the colleague's ear and through the use of an ear drawing and auricular map. Afterwards, a clinical case was presented to simulate auriculoterapia tratamento, in which they had to locate the auricular points according to the school and branch studied and apply the points using seeds on their colleagues. The WhatsApp group was maintained, and discussions of cases, questions, and feedback frequently occur. Among the 19 students who completed the training, 13 reported applying auriculoterapia to friends, family members, and/or patients. The number of nurses using auriculoterapia can be understood as a positive aspect of the training. Patient segurança, the adoption of baseado em evidence practices, and efetividade in nursing care are expected results with improved professional training. The experience has had an impact on the spread of auriculoterapia in Portugal, thus fostering new classes and new horizons with regard to its use as an intervenção in nursing care.",

    "abstract": "Reiki is a therapeutic practice that utilizes hand placement to channel Universal Energy. This practice was institutionalized by the National Policy on Integrative and Complementary Practices in Health (PICS) at the Brazil Ministry of Health (MS) in 2017. The Health Promotion and Social Cooperation Advisory (APSCS) of the Oswaldo Cruz Institute (IOC)/Fiocruz _Rio de Janeiro_RJ _Brazil, trains workers and students at levels (I, II, IIIA, and IIIB) in Reiki. After completing level IIIA training, the Reiki practitioner is capable of developing various practices relevant to this level, one of which is the sending of Reiki Energy to Planet Earth. Within this context, there exists a \"Gaia Theory,\" proposed by scientist and environmentalist James Lovelock and biologist Lynn Margulis, which posits that Earth functions as a living organism that self-regulates (https://www.sciencedirect.com/topic/earth-and-planetary-sciences/gaia-hypothesis). Thus, a group of Reiki practitioners was formed in alignment with this theory, considering our Planet Earth as a large living being to whom they send Reiki. This initiative arose during the COVID-19 pandemic with the aim of sending Universal Reiki Energies to assist in the balance of all living beings. Objective: To send Universal Reiki Energy to Planet Earth. Methodology: From August 2, 2021, to June 14, 2025, Reiki was sent to the planet with the participation of 15 practitioners at level IIIA. The sending frequency is daily, lasting 5 to 10 minutes, and its record is maintained on an internet platform (messaging application) and transcribed into a database (electronic spreadsheet). The sending occurs at non-specific times, at the discretion of the participant. From the perspective of the Reiki participants, the practice of sending Universal Energies (Reiki) to Planet Earth contributes to the expansion of individual co-responsibility in a therapeutic approach aimed at the well-being of practitioners. Although our planet is considered a living being according to the \"Gaia Theory,\" which possesses favorable conditions for the emergence and maintenance of life, as well as the interconnection of all living beings, this study could not quantify the effect of transmitting Reiki Energy to Planet Earth due to the absence of appropriate technology for such measurement. In this regard, further research is necessary to elucidate these practices. However, reports from Reiki participants indicated activation of feelings of belonging, wholeness with Planet Earth, promoting strengthening and cohesion among living beings, the environment, and society. These effects align with literature highlighting Reiki as an integrative practice that promotes holistic health, reinforcing the personal development of practitioners. It also raises profound questions regarding resilience, revisiting important values for a more physically, emotionally, mentally, and spiritually balanced life, and primarily an integral perspective towards inhabitants and Gaia. This initiative originated during the COVID-19 pandemic to transmit Universal Reiki Energies to support the stabilization and harmony of all living entities on Earth. This practice is currently being implemented due to ongoing global crises, including conflicts, famine, and socio-political instability. To date, a total of 3,820 participant engagements have been recorded, representing responses to 1,214 of the 1,414 scheduled transmissions, equating to approximately 85.85% of the days annually executed by Reiki practitioners. The remote transmission to Earth has elicited predominantly positive effects among participants, including enhanced well-being, increased sense of connection, stress reduction, and improved emotional and mental stability.The act of distant sending to Planet Earth has positively reverberated for the majority of participants, resulting in a sense of well-being and connection, reduced stress, and feelings of emotional and mental balance. Reiki practitioners authorized to transmit this energy operate at varied times and locations, reflecting their diverse professional commitments within Fiocruz. The primary challenge is to quantitatively assess their activities and evaluate the impact of Reiki energy on environmental or planetary parameters with sufficient accuracy. Consequently, the development or adoption of more precise and suitable measurement instruments is necessary to reliably evaluate the intervenção resultados.",

    "abstract": "It is with immense joy and satisfaction that I share the experience of the \"Seeds of Peace\" project, an initiative I had the privilege of conceiving and leading in the health units of Vacaria. As a municipal public servant, nursing technician, Usui Reiki therapist, humanized massage therapist, and undergraduate student in Integrative and Complementary Therapies. The \"Seeds of Peace\" project grew from a careful and sensitive observation: the challenging and often exhausting routine of healthcare professionals in Vacaria. In our beloved city, in the heart of the Serra Gaúcha, the saúde pública system pulsates intensely, and our colleagues, with their tireless dedication, daily face challenges that can weigh on both soul and body. The workload, dealing with the suffering of others, and the constant demand for excellence create a highly demanding scenario. \"Seeds of Peace\" served as a bridge: an invitation to self-care. News of the project spread like a gentle breeze, and participation was a testament to the latent need for a kinder self-regard. The \"Seeds of Peace\" project was met with enthusiasm and gratitude. Sessions were held in a welcoming and peaceful environment within the health units themselves, offering a respite in participants' daily routines. To enhance relaxation, the atmosphere was enriched with aromaterapia , soft music terapia with relaxing melodies and tea terapia. The professionals served included administrative assistants, hygienists, oral health assistants, dentists, community health agents, nursing technicians, nurses, and doctors. Each session was conducted exclusively by me, allowing for a genuine and personalized connection with each colleague. \"Seeds of Peace\" gently sought to touch the invisible wounds that the daily healthcare routine can leave. Our focus was to soften the burden of occupational stress, alleviate the fatigue that insists on settling in, and calm the exhaustion that consumes the bodies and souls of our professionals. Anxiety, sleepless nights, aches that lodge in the shoulders, and the dreaded burnout syndrome are realities that afflict those who give so much. The project extended an embrace of light, offering a tool for the release of these tensions, contributing to the flourishing of each employee's mental and physical health. It was a silent recognition, a gentle reminder that those who care also deserve to be cared for. With the implementation of the \"Seeds of Peace\" project, I observed in each session a decrease in ansiedade, relief from physical pain, and, notably, a look of serenity and renewal after completion. At the end of each session, to further embrace and incorporate care, a chamomile or peppermint tea was served. These expected results were enhanced by combining complementary therapies, chosen for their recognized holistic benefits to physical and mental well-being: Aromaterapia: Using a humidifier with essential oils, aromaterapia impacts the limbic system, influencing emotions and memories. Lavender: Known for its calming properties, it helps reduce ansiedade and promotes sleep. Rosemary: Stimulating, it aids in relieving muscle aches, mental fatigue, and improves focus. Lemongrass: With a fresh, citrusy aroma, it's energizing and contributes to stress reduction and mental clarity. Music Therapy: Soft, relaxing melodies create an environment conducive to meditação and relaxation, calming both mind and body. Chaterapia: The ritual of drinking a warm tea offers a moment of comfort and reinforces self-care. Chamomile: Famous for its sedative and anti-inflammatory properties, ideal for reducing ansiedade and inducing restorative sleep. Peppermint: Refreshing and digestive, it contributes to mental clarity, aids in relieving nausea, and provides a sensation of lightness and overall well-being. Together, these practices offer integrated care, promote self-care, and significantly contribute to the qualidade de vida of healthcare professionals. In light of this deeply enriching experience, I wholeheartedly recommend that programs promoting well-being, with the sweetness and efetividade of integrative therapies like Reiki, be embraced and cultivated in our healthcare environments. It is vital that municipal administrations open their eyes and hearts to the immense value of these practices in the occupational health of those on the front lines, dedicating resources and a space of affection for their continuous implementation. I dream of creating permanent peaceful corners in the units, where self-care can freely flourish. Furthermore, encouraging the training of more healthcare professionals in these therapies would be like planting more seeds, creating an internal network of mutual care and support. Documenting every small miracle of well-being, even the most subtle, is essential for this light to continue guiding new paths of care. The \"Seeds of Peace\" project was received with enthusiasm and gratitude. The sessions were held in a welcoming and peaceful environment within the health units themselves, providing a respite in the daily routine of the participants. Each session was conducted exclusively by me, allowing for a genuine and personalized connection with each colleague. I could observe with each session a decrease in ansiedade, relief from physical pain, and, most importantly, a look of serenity and renewal after completion. Seeing the positive impact of Reiki on the lives of my colleagues, even if for a few minutes of relaxation, was extremely gratifying. Receiving their testimonials about improved sleep quality, reduced stress, and an overall sense of well-being reinforced the importance and efetividade of integrative and complementary therapies in the workplace, especially in demanding areas like healthcare. \"Seeds of Peace\" was more than a project; it was an act of caring and recognition for these professionals who give so much of themselves. It proved that sowing small seeds of well-being can yield fruits of peace and balance in an environment that greatly needs it. I hope this initiative serves as an inspiration for more spaces and opportunities for self-care to be created in various sectors, because caring for those who care is fundamental for a healthier and happier society.

    "abstract": "This report describes an intervenção carried out in the Brazilian saúde pública system, based on the principles of Anthroposophic Medicine, where external therapies, group work, medical assistance and production of medicines are applied, consolidating the recognition and implementation of this practice within the scope of the Brazilian Unified Health System (Brasil, 2006). This practice was implemented in the saúde pública system in the city of São João del-Rei in 2002, being expanded in 2008 with the creation of the Reference Center for Anthroposophic Medicine, in line with the guidelines of the National Policy for Integrative and Complementary Practices of the Ministry of Health ( Vieira, 2018). We present anthroposophical-based group work and body care methods, based on anthroposophical principles. We emphasize the importance of care dedicated to people with severe psychic suffering, through fairy tale groups that supports individuals stigmatized by psychiatric diagnoses (Vieira; Melo, 2024). In addition, we highlight physical activities for the elderly, applying the Neurofunctional Reorganization Method (Pereira, 2024), Cantoterapia groups (Rocha et al., 2022), therapeutic felting and an expanded approach to anthroposophical medical care, including the production of anthroposophical medicinal formulas and external therapies, such as Threefoldness Therapy and geoterapia (Mühlenpfordt et al., 2022; Vieira, 2004; Vieira et al., 2022; Pugliesi; Guelman, 2017). The Anthroposophical Medicine Reference Center also hosts complementary practices such as Reiki, auriculoterapia and the Bioexpression group (Pereira, 2011). This space also serves as an training site for undergraduate medical students from the Federal University of São João del-Rei, as well as for extension and residency programs in Family and Community Medicine (Oliveira et al., 2022; Vieira et al., 2022). In 2024, we provided a total of 6,371 consultations in the various services offered, as well as producing 9,362 anthroposophical medicines. Our work aims to achieve effective integration with the assisted community, recognizing the essential role of collaboration between families, the community and the environment. The support of volunteers is fundamental to strengthening and guaranteeing the quality and scope of our services, leading to a more participatory and responsible approach. Although preliminary research has been carried out, there is still a significant gap in understanding of the care provided. Therefore, expanding the scope and depth of this research is essential to improve existing practices, guide public policies, and guarantee more humanized, effective care that addresses the actual needs of the population.",

    "abstract": "This relato de experiência presents the effort to implement homeopatia as a complementary approach to support smoking cessation in a public healthcare service in Brazil. The practice was implemented in a atenção primária clinic that offers multidisciplinary care, including integrative and complementary practices (TCMIs). The initiative responds to the demand for expanding therapeutic options in the management of tobacco dependence, aligned with national health policies that recognize TCMIs. The experience was developed at Policlinic of Duque de Caxias, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. This region faces a high demand for services related to chronic diseases, including tobacco dependence, which remains a significant saúde pública issue. In response to this demand, the healthcare unit offers a smoking cessation program that includes counseling, pharmacological support, and integrative practices, aligning with the Brazilian National Policy on Integrative and Complementary Practices (PNPIC). The integrative approach described in this report involved the introduction of homeopatia as a supportive terapia for individuals engaged in the smoking cessation program. The homeopathic tratamento followed the principles of heteroisoterapia, utilizing individualized preparations based on the patient's own tobacco exposure. The intervenção aimed to assist with reducing the desire to smoke, improving emotional well-being, and supporting the overall cessation process. This initiative was carried out by a multidisciplinary team, including pharmacists and other healthcare professionals trained in homeopatia and smoking cessation care. Throughout the process, participants received counseling sessions and guidance on the use of homeopathic medicines, contributing to a comprehensive, patient-centered approach. The practical implementation demonstrated that the homeopathic intervenção was well accepted by participants. Many reported improvements in managing the desire to smoke, emotional regulation, and motivation to quit smoking. There were no reports of efeitos adversos related to the homeopathic tratamento. Additionally, the incorporation of homeopatia was perceived by the healthcare team as an important enhancement to the quality of care, fostering a more holistic approach that aligns with the principles of integrative health. The Isomaker® device was used to extract smoke from each participant's cigarette of dependency as part of the individualised homeopathic intervenção. Lactose tablets were made with the 6cH potency, and the extracted smoke solutions were dynamized in accordance with the Brazilian Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia. Patients who participate in the National Tobacco Control Program (PNCT) at Polyclinic received the medicines prepared by University of Pharmacy (Federal University of Rio de Janeiro) during the weekly meeting. The integration of homeopatia in public smoking cessation programs offers some lessons and recommendations: (a) Strengthening professional training in integrative practices is essential for successful implementation; (b) The need for service regarding the production and dispensing of homeopathic medicine at public primary healthcare unit. Further studies and systematic evaluations are recommended to better assess the efetividade and sustainability of such intervençãos within saúde pública.

    "abstract": "The PICS in Duque de Caxias promote a new culture of care, strengthening the relationship between therapist and patient. These practices empower individuals and promote their protagonism in the healing process, working in conjunction with conventional tratamentos and offering an integrative approach to health. Duque de Caxias, located 16 km from the capital of Rio de Janeiro, has a population of 808,161 inhabitants, according to the latest IBGE Census of 2022. The city is the second largest in the state of Rio de Janeiro in terms of economy and the third most populous (IBGE Census-2022) The city continues to advance with investments in integrative practices, especially in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), such as the creation of the Reference Center for Traditional Chinese Medicine and Integrative Practices. This center not only provides access to therapies that were previously restricted to the elite, but also fosters a welcoming and caring environment where everyone can seek relief from their afflictions and improve their qualidade de vida. A relevant aspect of this care is acupuntura, which has proven effective in providing emotional support to cancer patients. Studies indicate that acupuntura can reduce ansiedade, improve emotional well-being and assist in pain management, offering a space for emotional support that complements conventional tratamentos. We will also soon be opening the Casa do Autista, expanding our services to different segments of society and ensuring that more citizens have access to quality health services, where we will also be implementing the use of PICS. The city of Caxias implemented PICS to verify whether providing access to these therapies would promote an environment of welcome and care, where everyone could seek relief from their afflictions and improve their qualidade de vida.

Discussion: It is essential to recognize the importance of having managers who have a human and futuristic vision, valuing and understanding the relevance of PICS. Leadership that prioritizes the comprehensive health of the population not only transforms the way care is provided, but also establishes a management model that promotes inclusion and access to tratamentos that benefit everyone. Managers with this perspective understand that health is not limited to the absence of disease, but should encompass a state of physical, mental and social well-being, investing in practices that promote qualidade de vida and prevenção. Conclusion: The inclusion of PICS in Duque de Caxias has proven to be essential to promote relief and well-being for the entire population of the municipality, contributing to a better qualidade de vida for the population. This perspective of growth and continuous investment in integrative practices reflects the city's commitment to offering more humane, accessible and effective care to its population. BRAZIL.

    "abstract": "Since the implementation of the Unified Health System, Primary Care has been the gateway to the beginning of healthcare for the population, guided by the principles of universality, connection, continuity of care, comprehensive care, accountability, equity and social participation. It is characterized by a set of health actions, at the individual and collective levels, which encompass promoção da saúde and protection, disease prevenção, diagnosis, tratamento, rehabilitation, harm reduction and health maintenance, seeking to develop comprehensive healthcare (1). Integrative and Complementary Health Practices (ICHP) in Primary Care were integrated to complement the care already provided, with the purpose of improving the quality and provision of health services, promoting alternatives for the sustainable development of communities and encouraging social participation and collaborative practices. By considering the individual in a holistic way, respecting their uniqueness, ICHP contribute to comprehensive healthcare, requiring interaction between actions and services in the SUS. Studies indicate that ICHP approaches promote greater co-responsibility of individuals for their health, favoring a broader exercise of citizenship(2). ICHP can be performed both individually and collectively, depending on the practice performed. It should be noted that ICHP is the term used in Brazil to refer to the practices of integrative and complementary medicine. This paper aims to report the experience of implementing and maintaining a body practice group, Lian Gong, in a basic health unit in a city in the interior of São Paulo As a nurse in atenção primária, I provided care to people in all stages of the life cycle and with various health conditions, from acute cases to several chronic diseases. For users with chronic diseases, the unit offered some group follow-up, shared care and individual care options. In addition to medical and nursing consultations, there was also the offer of participation in body practice groups, Lian Gong, and in some cases, Auriculoterapia. Both practices were used to aid health tratamento. In Primary Care, some groups are promoted for social, therapeutic and support purposes, with the aim of composing and improving the healthcare of the user. Some ICHP can be carried out in groups, which favors the dissemination of the practice, knowledge by the users and sharing of experiences with more people. As a nurse in a Family Health Strategy team, one way of contributing to the promotion, prevenção and rehabilitation of the health of the users was to carry out the practice of Lian Gong in 18 therapies. This body practice of Chinese medicine promotes the prevenção and tratamento of musculoskeletal diseases and strengthens heart and lung functions. Carrying out this practice in a group allows the participants to take care of their health, as well as establish bonds and support networks, which help in the promotion and recovery of health. Lian Gong was offered twice a week, with a frequency of 12 to 25 participants, most of them women, with some chronic disease, such as high blood pressure, diabetes mellitus, depressão, ansiedade, osteoarthritis of the knees and spine, among other chronic diseases. Over the course of 19 years, the practice was offered continuously, maintaining the frequency of participants. It was noted that by attending these groups, people established a more effective and lasting bond with the team, as well as tended to practice their self-care. Some difficulties encountered were that not all of the team was familiar with the practice and could safely and confidently recommend this activity. In the unit, for many years, only one professional had the training to perform Lian Gong, so during vacation periods or leave, the group was suspended. As a nurse, there were also times when another nurse was absent, so I had to leave the group to prioritize individual care for the population, according to the demands of the day. We were able to minimize interruptions in the groups after training other professionals, who helped to maintain the activity. Another strategy to improve the team's dissemination and knowledge about the practice was to talk about the group in team meeting spaces and general meetings, when new professionals arrived, and to publicize the groups in other collective spaces for the team and the community.",

    "abstract": "Home care work demands not only technical skills but also intense emotional involvement, particularly in palliative and rehabilitative care (2). This context contributes to high levels of stress, ansiedade, and other mental health complaints, which compromise both the professionals qualidade de vida and the quality of care provided (3), highlighting the urgent need for intervençãos that address both individual and collective well-being (2). Integrative and Complementary Health Practices (PICS) have proven effective in reducing these symptoms and promoting well-being (1,4). They support physical and emotional balance and are recommended by the Ministry of Health, despite their still incipient implementation in the SUS (1,5,6). The Therapeutic Moment project was developed in this context, aiming to promote health and emotional support for professionals in the Better at Home home care program, focusing on illness prevenção and strengthening holistic care. The project was launched in May 2023 and is still ongoing in a city in the interior of São Paulo. It was developed by health professionals from the Better at Home team, with institutional support, and scheduled during working hours to respect the teams workload and service demands. Weekly 40-minute sessions included auriculoterapia, laser acupuntura, systemic laser terapia, and cupping terapia, conducted by two trained public servants. On average, 10 to 15 professionals participated per session, including nursing technicians, nurses, speech therapists, and physicians. Demographic data and main complaints were collected through spontaneous reports during the sessions and notes by the practitioners. Results: Most participants were female (94%), aged between 28 and 58 years. Regarding race, 57% self-identified as White, 36% as Brown, and 7% as Black. The most frequent complaints included stress, ansiedade, muscle pain, emotional exhaustion, and anguish. Post-session reports indicated significant improvements in relaxation, sleep quality, muscle tension relief, and work-related motivation. The experience demonstrated that incorporating PICS into the institutional routine benefits both individual health and collective well-being, fostering a sense of belonging, bonding, and active listening among professionals. A relevant impact indicator was participants enthusiasm and active anticipation for the sessions. The experience demonstrated that incorporating PICS into the institutional routine benefits both individual health and collective well-being, fostering a sense of belonging, bonding, and active listening among professionals. A relevant impact indicator was participants enthusiasm and active anticipation for the sessions. Despite the positive resultados, the project faced major challenges for its maintenance and expansion, such as limited financial and material resources, lack of time in professionals' schedules, and a shortage of trained practitioners. These barriers reveal the fragile structure of PICS within the SUS and the lack of prioritization for worker care. Therefore, the creation of public policies and institutional strategies is recommended to recognize and integrate these practices permanently in health services, as outlined by the National Policy on Integrative and Complementary Practices. Investing in the care of caregivers is essential for the sustainability of the health system and the quality of care delivered to the population.",

    "abstract": "Primary Health Care (PHC) is the main gateway to the Unified Health System and its actions aim to promote health, prevent diseases, diagnose, treat, rehabilitate, reduce harm and maintain the health of the population. Therefore, PHC plays an important role in the prevenção of some Chronic Non-Communicable Diseases (CNCD) prevalent in the population, such as Diabetes Mellitus (DM). We know that the Brazilian population values popular culture, especially knowledge of Medicinal Plants, and uses them to treat and prevent some diseases and illnesses, including DM. Medicinal plants have great pharmacological potential and are allies of the population. However, their incorrect use can cause health problems, drug interactions and even more serious toxic reactions. The use of medicinal plants focused on healing is one of the oldest forms of tratamento known to mankind. It is related to the beginning of medicine and pharmacy and is based on the accumulation of information passed down and improved from generation to generation. Over the centuries, medicinal plants have been the basis for the tratamento of various diseases and prevenção (1). Culture, the appreciation of popular knowledge, and the vast biodiversity justify the great demand and demand for medicinal plants in Brazil, where approximately 82% of the population uses preparations and products based on medicinal plants (2). Public policies and legislation related to medicinal plants and phytotherapeutics have advanced after the publication of Ordinance No. 971 of May 3, 2006 by the Ministry of Health, which instituted the Decree No. 5,813 of June 22, 2006, which established the Medicinal Plants and Phytotherapeutics Policy (3,4). The objective of this work was to prepare educational material in the form of a folder on the safe use of medicinal plants in DM to be given to users with this chronic condition in individual and group care. Three medicinal plants widely used for the tratamento of DM were listed: garlic (Allium sativum), bitter melon (Momordica charantia) and pata de vaca (Bauhinia forficata or variegata). These three plants were chosen because they are easily accessible and widely known. The decision to create a folder on medicinal plants was made after approaching the population of the Health Center, in individual and group care for users undergoing tratamento for diabetes. Many of them associated some medicinal plant in addition to the prescribed medication and after concomitant use, they discontinued the allopathic medication because they believed it was doing them harm. Conventional tratamento for DM is offered free of charge by the Unified Health System throughout the country. However, it is not always easy to manage pharmacoterapia and control, as this depends on numerous factors, such as: medication adherence (whether oral and/or subcutaneous, in the case of insulin), the availability of medications in the network and even the level of understanding of the patient and their family regarding ongoing tratamento. However, we know that many patients seek other tratamento options, including the elderly population. We know that Brazil is a country with numerous cultures and traditions, and among them the use of Medicinal Plants stands out, and it is important to welcome and value this knowledge and practices, as it was often they that led science to discover new tratamentos and even cures through chemical compounds found in plants. It is currently a great challenge to offer qualified care to the population, especially to DM sufferers who require multiple actions to control it, since it is a costly disease for the individual, the family and the SUS. The impacts on their lives are not only financial. However, the more decompensated the DM, the higher the direct costs of its tratamento due to complications related to the disease, which can often be reduced, delayed and even avoided with proper tratamento, giving sufferers better living conditions. There are studies and scientific evidence that prove the efficacy and segurança of using medicinal plants, including for DM. Therefore, we also know that potential interactions between allopathic medicines and plants can occur. It is important to highlight the importance of professionals being trained and familiar with the medicinal plants most used by the population in order to provide guidance on their safe use and also their risks, seeking to minimize drug interactions and contribute to the rational use of both plants and allopathic medicines, and contribute to adherence to DM tratamento and the qualidade de vida of these people. The use of medicinal plants for therapeutic purposes without the supervision of a health professional results in a potential danger to the population. It is important that services offer their professionals training and guidance on the subject through ongoing education and health education for users. Perhaps our greatest challenge as health professionals today regarding the use of Medicinal Plants is this: to know, understand and not judge and distance patients from their traditions and beliefs.",

    "abstract": "The Homeopathy in COVID-19 Urgent Social Solidarity Action was carried out in 2021 and 2022, in Brazil, centralized in the city of São Paulo, during the pandemic, with the objective of offering free homeopathic care via remote telecommunication1. Interested participants completed a registration and consent form (TCLE), made available electronically, to participate in the study that was developed after the end of the tratamento and previously approved by the Ethics Committee for Research with Human Beings: CAAE project: 50104521.1.0000.5506, opinion: 5.009.104. The services were provided remotely via digital platforms, following the World Health Organization's guidelines for social distancing. Homeopathic volunteers, qualified by their Professional Councils, provided homeopathic assistance and guidance to interested parties classified into four groups: Non-COVID, During COVID, Post-COVID and Vaccination. Homeopathic pharmacies supported the project by donating medicines or reducing costs. The main objective of this prospective study is to examine the administrative management and operational procedures, identifying successes and difficulties. The specific objectives are: (i) to analyze the profile of the project participants, considering data such as gender, age, occupation and region of residence; (ii) to identify the regions with the greatest number of homeopathic professionals; (iii) to identify the most accessible digital technologies; (iv) to develop a proposal for remote telecommunication in Homeopathy. The lack of specific medications for the prevenção or tratamento of COVID-19 symptoms, the need for social distancing, as recommended by the World Health Organization, and the urgency of actions in the pandemic, motivated homeopathic professionals in the city of São Paulo to create a solidarity action, with the aim of minimizing illness and the worsening of symptoms due to COVID-19, through Homeopathy and enabling access to homeopathic medicine. Most of the participants in the Action were from the state of São Paulo. The project was managed by five pharmacists and one physiotherapist. Most of the patients treated were female, aged between 40 and 49, working in the health sector. The prescribing team was made up mostly of pharmacists, with qualifications and experience in Homeopathy. In just two months, the team managed to structure an action that reached 18 Federation Units, recruiting homeopathic volunteers, establishing partnerships with pharmacies to donate medicines or reduce costs, publicizing the social action, creating forms and operational procedures, and gathering support material. The use of smartphones and computers, and internet access proved efficient in serving those interested, through video or audio communication, using Whatsapp and Google Meet, and at low cost. Procedures and documents were created for: registration of interested parties according to the desired service, homeopathic volunteers and homeopathic pharmacies; submission to the Research Ethics Committee; survey of related legislation; flow and recording of services; prescription; and data entry. Desafios: Improve operational procedures and create a protocol; raise awareness and train volunteers; monitor and evaluate all phases of the process; transform the emergency initiative into a structured and sustainable model, allowing the population to be served through accessible technologies, consolidating Homeopathy as an integrative practice in saúde pública.",

    "abstract": "Cuba began a process of institutionalizing Natural and Traditional Medicine during the 1990s. Based on a strong political will, and under the leadership of the Ministry of Public Health, one of the prioritized areas of work was the development of capacity building and training programs in the healthcare sector. During those years, a cross-curricular strategy was implemented for all undergraduate curricular programs of medical science careers. Also various postgraduate, diploma courses and master's degrees were developed. The Natural and Traditional Medicine specialty for medical doctors was introduced in 1995. Professionals from several countries supported Cuba in the initial stages of this process, drawing on their experiences and development in different areas such as acupuntura, homeopatia, and Bach flower terapia. The Natural and Traditional Medicine curricular strategy is currently maintained at the undergraduate programs, but for the medical undergraduate students, it is also incorporated as an independent subject linked to the discipline of Family Medicine. Specialist training takes place at 12 medical science universities, eight of which have been certified of excellency by the national accreditation board. The country currently has 397 specialists and 198 residents. In addition, four universities offer master's programs in Natural and Traditional Medicine. Other medical specialties (Family Medicine, Gastroenterology, Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Pediatrics, etc.) integrate Natural and Traditional Medicine contents into their acadêmico programs, and various postgraduate course options are maintained for continuous medical education. An analysis of the work developed in the past thirty years allows us to identify as the main lessons learned (1) the importance of political will for the development of Natural and Traditional Medicine; (2) the strength of having extended a national training strategy aimed at undergraduate and graduate students to facilitate learning of these therapeutic approaches; (3) the importance of international collaboration on relevant topics such as acupuntura (China, Vietnam, North Korea), homeopatia (Brazil, Argentina, Mexico), etc.; (4) the significance of the specialization program for doctors, its generalization to the majority of medical universities in the country and its acadêmico strengthening; and (5) the link between medical education and medical care in the health services network for practical learning of Natural and Traditional Medicine. The main challenges currently from an educational point of view are related to (1) to continue strenghtening the integration of Natural and Traditional Medicine in the different careers of medical sciences and postgraduate specialties; (2) to extend the specialization program for doctors to other medical universities and ensure its continuous improvement; (3) to expand master's programs at medical universities; (4) to develop a Cuban textbook that covers all thematic areas of the specialization program; and finally, (5) to strengthen international exchange with other universities and institues for the continuing medical education of our professionals. In this way, the integration of Natural and Traditional Medicine within the Cuban National Health System is ensured through guaranteeing the know and the know how to do of its professionals.",

    "abstract": "Autism has become a major concern for health authorities all over the world. According to the World Health Organization (1) autism often has an impact on education and employment opportunities. In addition, the demands on families providing care and support can be significant. This is particularly critical in many low- and middle-income countries as Brazil, where the big social unbalance and the lack of public policies able to offer proper tratamento and support, impose a sad reality to less fortunate atypical families. The 2013 version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5)(2), by the American Psychiatric Association, defines Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) as a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by persistent deficits in social communication and interaction, as well as restricted, repetitive patterns of behaviour, interests, or activities. Depending on their severity, these symptoms may affect people´s ability to function in school, work, and other areas of life. There isnt a single medication that treats autism. Medications usually address comorbidities or other symptoms. Other intervençãos may include the use of cannabidiol, a massive number of hours per week of Behavioural Management Therapies, as ABA (Applied Behaviour Analysis) besides specific therapies according to the person needs which, generally, are not affordable for poor atypical families. Therefore, having had a successful case with flower essence terapia of an autistic young man in the past, the author has started promoting the use of flower essences for this public until having the chance to evaluate this therapeutic modality with a larger sample. Floral terapia has been developed by an English physician, Dr Edward Bach, in the earlier thirties of last century. Its a person-centred therapeutic approach based on the use of natural products know as flower essences to balance negative emotional and/or mental estates, considered as the real causes of disease (3). Their unique concept, free of active chemical principles (4), allows their safe use by all ages as well as different administration possibilities. Since March 2018, floral terapia has been included in the Brazilian National Policy on Integrative and Complementary Practices (PNPIC) (5), which has prompted their offer at saúde pública units and hospitals of different Brazilian cities. However, their use as a complementary intervenção for people in the autism spectrum is still little available. Floral Therapy doesnt address what the person has but how the person reacts to what he/she has (3). Therefore, it can be useful to every area affected by autism spectrum disorder and/or other side symptoms. In addition, each flower essence may act in more than one affected area in a person with autism. As a consequence, in order to evaluate the service, questionnaires featuring common complains presented in people with autism have been developed. Overall data of the evaluated items show a not at all percentage always smaller than or absent in relation to other options (very much, quite a bit, just a little). In other words, flower essences have helped to improve the items evaluated, albeit in different percentages and customized individual formulas. Some other issues tracked individually as: sleep disorders, food selectivity and urinary issues, have also shown significant improvements. In addition, parents report positive changes in one to less than a month period. AAMPARA ´s public big rotativity per semester and/or year, poor instruction of most mothers and difficulty in adhering to the tratamento are some of the factors that prevent us from having a more precise portrait of the service. However, data collected from the follow up questionnaire feature, at least, one return.",

    "abstract": "Reiki is a practice of laying on hands that uses approximation or touch on the body to stimulate the natural mechanisms of health recovery. Based on the vitalist conception of health and illness also present in other therapeutic systems, it considers the existence of a channeled universal energy that acts on the balance of vital energy with the purpose of harmonizing the general conditions of the body and mind in an integral way. The terapia aims to strengthen the places where blockages are found - \"energy knots\" - eliminating toxins, balancing full cellular functioning, in order to reestablish the flow of vital energy. The practice promotes harmonization between the physical, mental and spiritual dimensions. It stimulates the energization of organs and energy centers. The practice of Reiki takes into account dimensions of consciousness, body and emotions, activates glands, organs, nervous, cardiac and immune systems, helps with stress, depressão and ansiedade, promotes the balance of vital energy and can be applied in person or remotely. This work presents the work of Sending Usui Reiki at a distance done by the Vijaya Rei Reiki Group through weekly online Meditation and Reiki sessions at a distance done by Reikians of the Vijaya Rei Group dedicated to education, awareness and integrative care aimed at Humans, Animals and the Planet that is part of the work of the Jarita Vijaya Institute (IJV). IJV is an organization that works as a social and popular clinic, providing education, assistance, support and shelter to all those in need. It arose from the personal journey of its founder, who delved into studies in Floral Therapy, Usui Reiki, Acupuncture and Integrative Practices and understood that it could help all those who are suffering, sick, afflicted, lost and without vitality. 9 years ago, she founded the Vijaya Rei Reiki Group, which meets weekly on Tuesdays, and since 2020 has promoted more than 230 open lectures addressing everyday topics with meditação and collective sending of reiki at a distance, reaching more than 62,000 people and animals who send their names and actively participate by being receptive to the sending. Among the main complaints mentioned by those assisted by the program we have: Anxiety, Depression, Grief, Pain, Cancer, Surgical Process, Ageism, Relationship Breakups, Unemployment, Feeling of Emptiness, Loneliness, Suicidal Tendencies, Diseases and discomforts mentioned in Humans, Animals and expanding to the Planet addressing the concept of One Health where Humans, Animals and the Environment are interrelated. The open lectures aim to inform, provoke and encourage proactivity in their life processes, meditação leads to relaxation and Reiki aims to harmonize the physical, mental, emotional and spiritual, leading to self-awareness and the invitation to live Just for Today. By promoting more than 230 different lectures on a variety of topics, our program has benefited more than 62,000 people and continues to be available on social media so that everyone can access the lecture content, guided meditação and remote Reiki. Participants mention relaxation, calmness, improved sleep, pain relief and clarity of thought, returning weekly to the proposed tratamento and combining it with conventional tratamento. Therefore, Reiki has been a positive intervenção that helps promote well-being by fostering care, happiness and understanding of life cycles. Reiki is a subtle, non-invasive integrative practice that can be applied to humans, animals and the environment in conjunction with conventional tratamentos. This requires joint work that involves ongoing education, instructional booklets, and research that proves its results and can be replicated by various groups around the world.",

    "abstract": "The S Space is a project run by the Youth Division of the Talent Promotion Department of Cascais Municipal Council, a municipality in the district of Lisbon, Portugal. It is a public service, completely free of charge, and is a comprehensive health support centre for young people aged 12 to 30 who live, study or work in the municipality of Cascais. This safe, accessible space dedicated exclusively to young people focuses on their emotional, psychological and physical well-being. The S Space offers a welcoming, confidential and anonymous environment, and is recognised in the municipality as a youth house. The young people enrolled can benefit from interdisciplinary intervenção in the areas of Psychology (in the form of individual psychotherapeutic support, pregnancy and maternity psychology and parenting support) and Nutrition (with a focus on food education and eating disorders). At the time of writing, the technical team consists of 8 psychologists and 2 nutritionists. Given the significant need to complement its work, the S Space established a protocol with A Barragem - Fundação Portuguesa para o Estudo, Prevenção e Tratamento das Dependências (The Dam - Portuguese Foundation for the Study, Prevention and Treatment of Addictions) for supervision in Clinical Psychology and for referrals to Psychiatry, Family and Couple Therapy and Addiction consultations. Referrals made to the Foundation are discussed monthly in intervision meetings with the technical teams from both services. The fundamental importance of investing in promoting mental health in young people was also noted, which is why the Integration and Self-Discovery Programmes axis has been created. This programme includes conversation circles, known to young people as Vitamin S, and other modalities that are still being developed, such as life coaching, yoga, atenção plena and meditação. Vitamin S is developed according to the methodology of Integrative Community Therapy, a group device born in the north-east of Brazil that aims to strengthen inter-community bonds and restore self-esteem. ICT follows rules of communication that establish a safe basis for sharing everyday concerns and coping strategies that empower and build resilience in the participants. Currently, Integrative Community Therapy (ICT) is present in more than 40 countries across the Americas, Europe, and Africa. It is recognized by the World Health Organization (WHO) as one of the most promising social technologies for mental healthcare, the promotion of self-care, and the strengthening of community support networks. The circles at the S Space take place every week on the same day and at the same time. Attendance at Vitamin S ranged from 3 to 9 participants, mostly female, in the 19 circles held up to the submission of this abstract. The TCI methodology is based on Paulo Freire's Pedagogy, which prioritises that problematisation must come from the participants themselves. For this reason, each circle asks who would like to bring their concerns, which gives the meeting a collective construction character. Once a month, however, a themed circle is held, in which Vitamin S's team of therapists suggests a theme that serves as an umbrella for the group's concerns. In February, for example, in celebration of Valentine's Day, there was a nurse specialising in community intervenção who worked on the subject of sexuality, STD prevenção and family planning. Among the concerns shared in the open discussions were: ansiedade about exams and school tests, difficulties socialising, inability to accept parental authority, frustration at not being able to overcome anorexia and mobile phone addiction. x Among the concerns shared in the open discussions were: ansiedade about exams and school tests, difficulties socialising, inability to accept parental authority, frustration at not being able to overcome anorexia and mobile phone addiction. Among the coping strategies, those considered most relevant by the girls include: acceptance, the ability to negotiate, the importance of parents as a source of tranquillity and security, recognising intuition as a resource for making decisions, reframing problems and letting them pass, looking at the stars and attending Vitamin S. After 25 weeks of experience, the team decided to invest in artistic ressources to facilitate the emergency of the concerns. This is a path we recommend to projects directed to promoting mental health for youth.",

    "abstract": "The ZENCancer Institute offers some Traditional, Complementary and Integrative Medicine (TCIM) that are supported every day by new scientific studies that prove their physical and emotional benefits, such as reducing cortisol levels, decreasing fatigue, improving sleep disorders and reducing ansiedade and fear, contributing significantly to the recovery of the immune system and to the qualidade de vida of patients during and after tratamento. Based on the holistic vision that integrates body, mind and spirit, the ZENCancer Institute recognizes that self-knowledge and awareness of life impermanence promote serenity and reinforce proactive coping with adversity. The Psychoterapia Center began in May 2020, motivated by the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and the growing need for therapeutic support for cancer patients. Social isolation, the interruption of in-person consultations, and uncertainty about tratamento prognosis highlighted the increase of ansiedade and depressive symptoms in this group. In response, the Center's coordinator Deborah Guimarães structured a 100% online model of individual and group psychoterapia, which could reach patients from different regions, without geographical barriers. The project started offering weekly, individual Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) sessions, lasting 50 minutes, to each participant. Later, psychologist Elaine joined as a volunteer, and her experience in integrative oncology was fundamental to the development and coordination of the Cognitive-Behavioral Group Therapy (CBGT). Then, psychologist Soraia also joined the team and, together, we began to lead groups of 8 to 12 patients, with weekly 90-minute meetings for eight-week cycles. The approach is based on the principles of CBT, as postulated by Aaron T. Beck and Albert Ellis, which support the interrelationship between thoughts, emotions and behaviors. From this perspective, we work on identifying and restructuring dysfunctional automatic thoughts, emotional regulation through diaphragmatic breathing techniques and progressive relaxation exercises, as well as the practice of atenção plena to promote body and mental awareness. CBGT adds the collective support factor, allowing participants to validate their experiences and build a mutual support network. The adhesion process began with an initial screening, carried out through an electronic form and prior presentation, to assess the indication for individual or group care. Then, each patient participated in a standard psychological evaluation, which included the Anxiety Scale (BAI) and Depression Scale (BDI). These instruments allowed us to quantitatively monitor symptoms before the therapeutic cycle, in the middle of the process and at the end of the eight weeks. During each CBGT session, the structure followed a script based on content presentation, discussion of home exercises, application of cognitive restructuring techniques and training of coping skills. Additionally, we incorporated psychoeducation on the neurobiological basis of stress and its impact on the immune response, which reinforced the participants' engagement and understanding of the importance of therapeutic practices. Preliminary results demonstrated an average reduction of 40% in ansiedade scores and 35% in depressão scores at the end of the cycle, in addition to a 30% improvement in reported fatigue. A significant reduction in sleep latency time and an increase in overall efficiency were also observed, indicating direct benefits in the physical and emotional dimensions. In addition to quantitative metrics, we captured the subjective experience. The reports emphasized three central dimensions: the value of the space for listening and sharing, strengthening the perception of belonging to a welcoming community, and increasing self-compassion. Many participants reported that group interaction was a decisive factor in overcoming stigma and emotional isolation, promoting bonding and empathy. The challenges encountered included logistical issues, such as connection instability and adaptations of materials to the digital format. The diversity of technological familiarity among patients required individualized technical support in the first sessions. To overcome these barriers, we implemented individualized videoconferencing platform support. The success of the Psychoterapia Center in the virtual environment reinforces the relevance of online modalities as a complementary strategy to in-person care, especially in contexts with restricted access. The model proposed by the ZENCancer Institute amplifies the reach of TCIM in a multidisciplinary context, and shows that, with good professional training and adequate infrastructure, it is possible to offer effective psychological support, even remotely, concurrently to TCIM. Due to the positive results, we organized a collaborative project to produce a book that brings together the team's practical and scientific experience, including intervenção protocols, illustrative cases, and implementation guidelines. This initiative aims to disseminate the knowledge acquired and encourage replicability in other health institutions. In conclusion, this report demonstrates that the integration of TCIM with online CBT and TCIM constitutes a viable and effective approach for the comprehensive care of cancer patients. The findings indicate that baseado em evidence practices can promote well-being, acceptance, and resilience, contributing substantially to the mental health and qualidade de vida of these individuals. Future longitudinal studies and randomized controlled trials may deepen the understanding and optimize intervenção protocols.",

    "abstract": "The practices of Yoga and Tai Chi Pai Lin are offered by members of a Multidisciplinary Team in alternating sessions, as part of a group held in a community space located within the coverage area of two Primary Health Care Units of the Brazilian Unified Health System (SUS), in the southern region of São Paulo, Brazil. Following the physical practices, participants engage in dialogue circles on various topicssuggested by the group members themselvesas well as meditação sessions. The group meets weekly, with each session lasting approximately two hours. At the end of each meeting, participant satisfaction is assessed using the Net Promoter Score (NPS), and self-reported perceptions of the practices impact on physical and mental health are also evaluated. There has been a growing demand among SUS users for Integrative and Complementary Health Practices, as well as an increasing interest from Family Health Team professionals in adopting such practices to address common complaints encountered in individual consultationssuch as insomnia, stress, ansiedade, and dor crônica. This highlights the need for accessible, holistic care strategies that support physical and emotional well-being within the primary healthcare setting. The NPS score indicates that 95% of participants rated their satisfaction level as \"excellent\" regarding the practices offered. When evaluating mental health resultados, 61% of participants reported perceived reductions in stress and ansiedade, relief from mental tension, and an increased sense of relaxation. Regarding physical health, 32% reported perceived relief from dor crônica, greater energy levels, and improved body awareness. Additionally, 100% of participants associated the impact on overall well-being with the fact that the group takes place in an open space, which facilitates contact with nature. Yoga and Tai Chi are low-cost, well-accepted tools for promoting physical and mental well-being. Offered in group settings through saúde pública services, these practices democratize access to integrative care while also fostering social interaction and engagement with community spaces. The findings demonstrate that offering Yoga, Tai Chi Pai Lin, and dialogue circles contributes to improved user well-being and effectively addresses the needs identified by Family Health Teams. This underscores the importance of integration with Multidisciplinary Teams. Expanding the availability of Integrative and Complementary Health Practices to other healthcare facilities within the SUS is recommended, considering their positive impact on users' qualidade de vida.",

    "abstract": "There is growing concern about stress and mental health problems among healthcare workers. Nurses and doctors are at high risk of professional burnout, which refers to the symptoms caused by chronic stress at work and include emotional exhaustion, depersonalization and decreased personal achievement at work. Mindfulness reduces symptoms of stress, depressão and ansiedade. In addition, atenção plena intervençãos have also been effective in reducing burnout symptoms, improving subjective health and resilience. Thus, atenção plena-based intervençãos for healthcare professionals, developed in the workplace, could contribute to promoting the health and well-being of these professionals. The aim is to report on the experience of developing a atenção plena implementation project for Portuguese health professionals. Eight atenção plena-based intervençãos were carried out for seven atenção primária health professionals in Portugal, in the city of Coimbra. The meetings took place once a week, collectively, led by a doctor of nursing who is trained in the practice. A team of researchers prepared a manual entitled Promoting socio-emotional well-being based on the principles of atenção plena, containing the collective and individual activities for the eight weeks. Every week, the participants experienced different atenção plena-based practices collectively, as well as receiving guidance on individual activities to be carried out on a daily basis. The meetings lasted an average of one hour a week and were held in a room available at the participants' workplace. The room was spacious and had air conditioning, mattresses, pillows and blankets for the participants' comfort. The intervençãos were carried out during the months of January and February 2025. In the first week before the intervenção, questionnaires were administered on perceived stress and psychological well-being, which were reapplied after the eighth intervenção. The perceived stress scale contains 13 items, each asking how the person felt in the month preceding the response. It is a 5-point Likert-type scale, ranging from 1 (never) to 5 (often). The overall score is the sum of the scores assigned to each item, with the highest score representing the greatest stress in the past month, and the maximum score is 52 points. The Psychological Well-Being Scale contains 18 items and reflects psychological functioning based on the following dimensions: self-control, personal development, life goals, positive relationships with others, environmental control, and autonomy. Each of the six scales/dimensions consists of three items specific to a specific measurement. It is a Likert scale with a 6-point response attribute. Scores range from 3 to 18, and the result for each scale is obtained by summing the items, after shifting the inverse items. Higher scores indicate higher levels of psychological well-being. The project was approved by the Health Ethics Committee No. 41/2023 and the participants signed a consent form. The program developed for health professionals showed good adherence and all the participants took part in the collective activities proposed (only one participant's data was excluded because he was absent from three meetings due to family issues). The results include the development of the program to guide the implementation of atenção plena-based intervençãos, the implementation of the eight weekly intervençãos and the results of the stress perception and psychological well-being scales applied before and after the eight meetings. Seven health professionals took part in the program, with an average age of 58. Five participants were female and two were male. The majority (n=5) were nurses, but psychologist (n=1) and social worker (n=1) took part. The participants had an average of 22.51 years' experience in their current area of work. All had a specialization degree and three had a master's degree. In relation to the perception of stress before and after the program, there was an average of 21.43 (SD=4.75) and 21.43 (SD=5.28) at both times, showing that there were no differences in this scale during the period investigated. With regard to the pre-program psychological well-being scale, there was an average total well-being of 82.71 (SD=14.47) rising to 84.86 (SD=13.29) post-program. For each dimension of the scale, the following values were observed, pre and post, respectively: Autonomy (13.86 with SD=3.38 maintaining 13.86 with SD=3.43), Environmental mastery (12.43 with SD=3.78 to 12.71 with SD=2.56), Personal growth (14 with SD=3.16 to 14.71 with SD=2.69), Positive relationships with others (13 with SD=2.94 to 13.86 with SD=2.26), Life goals (15 with SD=2.76 to 14.86 with SD=3.84) and Self-acceptance (14.57 with SD=3.86 to 14.88 with SD=3.38). There was no change in the perception of stress, but there was an increase in the average total well-being of the participants, indicating the possibility of a low-cost intervenção for the care of health professionals in their workplace. The objective of the study was achieved. The implementation project was found to be feasible and could be implemented in other healthcare units in Coimbra. With qualified personnel to manage the project and a physical space for activities, it is considered a low-cost project that can contribute to improving the overall well-being of healthcare professionals in their work environment. One of the limitations of the study was the total number of participants; however, the program will be implemented in other health units and more data can be analyzed in the future.",

    "abstract": "The implementation of Integrative and Complementary Practices (PICS) in hospital settings has demonstrated a positive impact not only on the patient experience, but also on the well-being of health professionals (Silva et al., 2018). Within the spectrum of these practices, with the growing appreciation of comprehensive care and emotional well-being for health, flower terapia emerges as a gentle, deep, non-invasive therapeutic approach, with no known side effects and easy to apply, becoming an attractive alternative as a complementary terapia in promoção da saúde. This relato de experiência describes the implementation of floral terapia at the Mandaqui Hospital Complex, located in the North Zone of São Paulo. Floral terapia was implemented at the CEPICS Clinic and School of Integrative and Complementary Health Practices, which is a space dedicated to welcoming and comprehensive care, acting as an environment focused on health and humanization amidst the busy routine of a large hospital. This report describes the obstacles, achievements and lessons learned during the process, with the aim of recording and evaluating the implementation experience and understanding its impact on the hospital environment. Implementation began in April 2019 at CEPICS, a space provided by the hospital to the Mandaqui Hospital Volunteers Association. This space is managed by a team of volunteers dedicated to promoting health through integrative and complementary practices. Activities such as Reiki and Chromoterapia were already available, and the inclusion of floral terapia has further expanded the care options. Services with Integrative and Complementary Health Practices (PICS) only occur when there is a medical referral. Floral terapia has been harmoniously integrated with other practices already established at CEPICS, helping to strengthen a culture of care at the Mandaqui Hospital Complex. The implementation is supported by a public-private partnership between CEPICS and the company Florais de Saint Germain, which is responsible for the therapeutic training of volunteers and the supply of floral essences. IMPLEMENTATION OF FLOWER THERAPY OCCURRED IN FIVE MAIN PHASES - Training and qualification of volunteers to work as floral therapists - Promotion of floral terapia among teams of health professionals - Raising awareness among hospital employees about self-care - Structure for the storage and handling of floral essences - Preparation of environments for floral terapia services Initially, there was a lack of interest in the new terapia, mainly because health professionals were not familiar with the mechanism of action of flower terapia. A publicity campaign was needed to inform the different sectors of health workers in the hospital about flower terapia. After the announcement, we noticed a slight increase in the interest of health professionals in self-care, as they realized the opportunity to use flower terapia as a natural approach to promote health and well-being. In March 2020, shortly before completing one year since the introduction of flower terapia at the Mandaqui Hospital Complex, the unexpected happened: the COVID-19 pandemic, which triggered an unprecedented crisis in the global health system. Faced with this new reality, CEPICS volunteers had to completely modify their activities. The care strategy focused on offering emotional support to health professionals, who were extremely overworked, making them the main beneficiaries of the PICS. This change involved the creation of a proactive care model, taking support into the work sectors, with the delivery of bottles of flower essences based on the emotional vulnerability presented. In a context of high vulnerability and stress caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, CEPICS has become a reference point for offering emotional and mental support to healthcare professionals, who, out of necessity, began to use flower terapia and become familiar with it. With the increased use of flower terapia and the favorable perception of its results, the recommendation of this terapia and the request for care by healthcare professionals grew exponentially. In 2019, the average number of flower essences delivered to patients was 1.164 bottles per year. Since the beginning of the pandemic in 2020, a special formula was developed to meet the demands of healthcare professionals, which resulted in a considerable increase in demand. 2.535 bottles of flower essences were distributed to employees this year. The growth trend continued, and until 2024, the annual average of flower essences delivered reached 5,000 bottles, consolidating the positive impact of this terapia in the hospital environment. For new PICS implementations in any health complex or structure, it is recommended that in the first four months the focus of care be directed to health professionals who work in that location and who are interested or curious about the therapies offered, so that they can try the therapies and, mainly, recommend them to patients based on their personal experience. Healthcare professionals often experience considerable psychological distress and burnout, leading to higher rates of absenteeism compared to other professions, highlighting the critical need for intervençãos that promote their well-being (Cohen et al., 2023). This report is based on the growing demand for integrative strategies that aim to improve the mental and emotional well-being of patients and health professionals. Interventions that aim to reduce burnout and improve mental health are crucial investments in the health workforce, which is the greatest asset of any health system (Hallam et al., 2024).",

    "abstract": "The aim of this work is to present the Body&Art Project developed at the ZenCancer Institute, a non-profit civil association founded in 2018. One of its main objectives is to provide free and voluntary care to cancer patients through Traditional, Complementary, and Integrative Medicine (TCIM). The Body&Art project emerged from the interaction between two of the Institute's Activity Centers  Art Therapy and Restorative Yoga  in order to contribute to the well-being of the cancer community by promoting activities primarily outdoors and in contact with nature. The first meeting took place in May 2023, and 10 meetings were held in Rio de Janeiro until July 2025. Activities are developed in annual thematic cycles, with the guiding themes being \"Cycles and Seasons\" in 2023, \"The Meanings of Life\" in 2024, and \"The Goddesses of the Soul\" in 2025. Meetings are bimonthly, taking place on Saturday mornings and lasting approximately three hours. Twelve places are available per meeting, and registrations are accepted in the event week. During this period, 34 people registered with ZENcancer have already participated in the project, which has had an average of nine participants per meeting, all women who have undergone or are currently undergoing cancer tratamento. Participants are welcomed to the event with a communal snack, followed by a theme presentation, a body-based approach, an art terapia activity, and a closing discussion and integration circle. Various therapeutic tools, such as movement, meditação, relaxation, yoga, dance and other expressive and playful activities through the body and the plastic language of Art Therapy are used as mediators in the process of self-knowledge and well-being. Stress, ansiedade, fear, isolation, low self-esteem, and difficulty expressing their emotions are challenges reported by patients during cancer tratamento. Participants frequently highlight issues related to communication and acceptance in their family, social, and professional relationships. Throughout the Body&Art program, the proposed activities provide a space for free expression where emotions, the organization of thoughts, and diverse sensations are welcomed and expressed during the sessions. In a group, each participant, within their capabilities, has the opportunity to perceive their body and emotions, process their pain, and express their creative potential in a playful way, giving flow to the meaning of existence and strengthening their awareness and self-esteem, which aids in the tratamento as a whole. We know the importance of restoring perception and awareness of vital aspects in life's journey, such as breathing, heartbeat, body movements associated with physical well-being, the quality of thoughts, emotions, spirituality and human creativity in achieving its fullness (ALVES, 1995). Analyzing the registrations and attendance lists for the Body&Art project in 2023, we noted that 7 of the 10 women who participated in the first meeting remain regulars, having attended at least 6 meetings. We also noted that of a total of 34 participants, 14 attended at least 2 meetings. We realized that this data demonstrates excellent engagement with the project, especially given the highly diverse group, with a wide range of ages and tratamento stages. We observed that a group of women naturally formed who embraced the project and strived to attend the meetings whenever possible, which became increasingly enriching and profound. Based on the verbal testimonies at the end of the meetings, we understand that the activities foster moments of positive emotions, generating enthusiasm, clarity, relief, and the unblocking of denser energies, allowing emotions to be expressed and reinterpreted. These accounts, as well as the visual recordings, portray feelings of unity, complicity, quality listening, harmony, and hope. The integration of artistic activity with body awareness enhances the therapeutic sensation and enriches qualidade de vida, helping participants experience the challenges present in any phase of cancer tratamento more easily and calmly, feeling welcomed and welcoming to one another. Ensuring that all available spaces are filled and that more people can participate in the project is a major challenge, as we observe many cancellations due to scheduling conflicts or absences due to tratamento side effects, which is perfectly understandable in the oncology context. Creating a waiting list and confirming the day before was a solution we found to realign vacancies and activities. Other challenges we currently encounter are related to the desire to implement systematic and ongoing work with regular participants, as well as the systematization of testimonial records. For similar projects, we recommend expanding the choice of location, considering that the quality of the experience surrounded by nature is always more enriching and that the collective has its own unique characteristics. We also emphasize that these listening and sharing spaces need to be protected, qualified, and also need to be continuously monitored, encouraged, and strengthened.",

    "abstract": "The \"Garden of Knowledge Project\" is a proposal that aims to promote the exchange of knowledge about medicinal plants of the Brazilian flora and the ancient knowledge of Ayurveda, through international cooperation and the scientific integration of experts from both fields. In the context of Integrative and Complementary Health Practices (PICS), both medicinal plants and Ayurveda share similarities and key points that contribute to healthcare. The objective of this work is to encourage autonomy and the exchange of knowledge about PICS, with a focus on promoção da saúde. The aim is to integrate the ancient Indian tradition with Brazilian popular knowledge, training therapists in a reflective and comprehensive manner. The initiative also seeks to simplify access to these practices and expand cultural exchange between Brazil and India. Two editions of the project have already been carried out, with exchanges of knowledge between Ayurveda and Brazilian medicinal plants. The first took place at Horto e Terrapia, and the second at Fórum Itaboraí  Fiocruz Petrópolis, where workshops on preparing health products were held: the workshop on medicated ginger oil through Ayurveda and the workshop on mulungu tincture through the popular culture of medicinal plants. These experiences strengthened the internal collaboration between Horto Fiocruz, Terrapia, Horto-Escola Fiocruz Petrópolis and Rede Fito, in addition to intensifying relations with Ayurveda, facilitated by Escola Yoga Brahma Vidyalaya. This institution contributed to the cooperation with Ayurveda doctors, who visit Brazil to share their knowledge, enriching the training of therapists from Fiocruz and its partners. The experience led to the production of a video and other materials under development. The motivation stemmed from understanding the use of medicinal plants, aligning the PICS through knowledge of different practices that enabled the exchange of knowledge on some new aspects established and used within the countries' cultures and in Ayurveda research, enhancing the training of therapists. Some discrepancies arose in the understanding of herbs with popular names due to their pronunciation in Portuguese, but the species names resolved these issues. Interestingly, the biggest issue was the case of a type of herb considered invasive in Brazil and in Ayurveda, widely used for the tratamento of liver diseases, spleen malfunction, skin conditions including cancer, kidney stones, and arthritis, causing surprise among experts and participants. The first edition had 22 participants, reinforced by another 20 in the second, including PICS therapists from various Fiocruz units, professionals and therapists from the Yoga Brahma Vidyalaya School, and health agents from the Três Rios Municipal Health System. They described it as a crucial moment to better understand the plants, their uses, and the therapeutic potential of these practices, facilitated by the experiences and exchange of knowledge in the Horto and the Sensitive Garden. They considered the proposed activities in the workshops on preparing Mulungu tincture and preparing medicated ginger oil to be innovative, enabling them to be applied in the practices of the participants, therapists in training, generating great interest and future partnerships. These meetings aim to broaden and diversify the perspectives on care and Health Promotion in Complementary and Integrative Health Practices (PICS), reverberating the scientific knowledge of the practices of medical rationality originating in India and the paths of traditional medicine of medicinal plants from indigenous, quilombola, farmer, and native peoples of Brazil. Strengthening International Collaboration, production of educational materials, article (in progress) and video produced are significant results. Experience shows that an interesting topic can convey meaning, evolving into constructive and collaborative learning. Regarding organization, each stage should involve those responsible for its tasks and demands. Communication tools (visitor registration form, invitation and presentation of the purpose of the activities, attendance lists, etc.) were used to request infrastructure resources and schedules from participants, guests, and institutions involved. Venue reservations, transportation, food, and logistical support must be met, without losing the common purpose of advancing and building intra- and inter-institutional bridges, in this specific case, bringing together international cooperation and scientific and cultural knowledge on medicinal plants of native species of Brazilian flora. The greatest lesson learned is identifying opportunities and partnerships with shared interests and, thus, organizing as a thematic network, which are crucial for success.",

    "abstract": "Obesity is a chronic condition that requires integrated intervençãos focused on food education, autonomy, and the strengthening of self-care. The use of culinary practices in therapeutic contexts has been recognized in the literature as an effective complementary tool in managing chronic diseases, including obesity. Strategies such as cooking workshops, teaching kitchen programs, and meal preparation practices have shown benefits in modifying eating behavior and strengthening the relationship with food. This report aims to describe the experience of using an Experimental Kitchen as a complementary tool in the tratamento of obesity during hospitalization in a specialized hospital, highlighting its potential to promote food autonomy, sustainability, and engagement in the self-care process. This is an relato de experiência, approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the State University of Bahia (UNEB), CAAE: 65578822.1.0000.0057, describing the use of an Experimental Kitchen as an integrative approach in the hospital tratamento of obesity. The intervenção was carried out between 2020 and 2022 in a hospital unit specialized in the multidisciplinary care of severe obesity. The sessions were held weekly, lasting 60 minutes, led by nutritionists, psychologists, and occupational therapists, with active participation from the patients. The practical classes took place in an experimental kitchen, using recipes based on functional foods, regional ingredients, and low-cost, easy-to-prepare dishes. The sessions also served as spaces for sharing experiences, encouraging reflection on eating habits, meal planning, and self-care strategies for the post-hospitalization period. Some of the recipes taught included pumpkin vatapá, functional granola, green banana biomass and cocoa dessert, gluten-free nut bread, regional fruit sorbet, and healthy preparations for São João festivities. The integration of the Experimental Kitchen into the hospital setting aimed to address several challenges in the care of patients with obesity: Development of healthy recipes aligned with the therapeutic goals of a hypocaloric diet, while respecting cultural, regional, and emotional food traditions. The preparations used everyday ingredients with functional properties and encouraged mindful consumption by teaching about local agriculture. Encouragement of the consumption of foods not typically present in the patients' routines, focusing on lifestyle changes. Support in overcoming behavioral and emotional resistance related to adopting new eating patterns, including the incorporation of healthy habits within the family environment. Hospitalized patients undergoing obesity tratamento participated in the activity, organized according to their hospitalization period. The sessions were thematic and covered a range of topics, from the use of kitchen utensils and household measurements to culinary techniques and recipe development, including food tasting. Concepts of mindful eating were also introduced, and the applicability of the techniques learned to the patients dietary routines after hospital discharge was discussed. The involvement of the multidisciplinary team enriched the exchange of experiences and fostered a broader approach to healthy eating in the context of obesity care. The implementation of an Experimental Kitchen in hospital settings focused on obesity tratamento can be recommended as a relevant integrative tool. The interdisciplinary nature of the sessions proved essential for enhancing learning and expanding the perspective on lifestyle change among patients. Desafios included providing support to overcome behavioral and emotional resistance to new dietary patterns and incorporating regional and sustainable foods that resonate with the patients cultural background during and after hospitalization. This experience reinforces the potential of the Experimental Kitchen as a complementary integrative practice in the tratamento of obesity and in promoting food autonomy.",

    "abstract": "Farol Integrative Health operates in the promotion of integrative health, focusing on peripheral areas in the south of São Paulo, such as Capão Redondo and Campo Limpo, through a care model that combines integrative practices, community strengthening, and social development. The Integrated Health Experience is an educational workshop designed in 2022 by naturologist Fernanda Scheffer Augusto da Rocha. It aims to approach health from a broadened, accessible, and experiential perspective, strengthening health, preventing disease, and fostering health education through a simple and effective theory-practice activity, based on accessible self-care practices. The workshop was held in community spaces, health centers, and schools in the territory, and it expands the concept of health across physical, metabolic, vital, emotional, mental, and supramental dimensions. Aligned with Farols model  founded on Salutogenic, Vitalistic, Integrative Health, and Social Production of Health perspectives  it stimulates community empowerment, autonomy in care, and a positive social impact. Between 2024 and 2025, 15 workshops were held with 249 participants and a 99.5% satisfaction rate, reflecting impacts on the participants well-being, network strengthening, and adherence to self-care. The experience highlights the importance of integrating integrative practices into the health system and community spaces, demonstrating high replicability and potential for social transformation. Contextualization: The Integrated Health Experience is an educational workshop offered by Farol to promote health and community strengthening in peripheral neighborhoods of São Paulo. It was implemented in spaces such as SASF Capão Redondo, UBS Lídia, UBS Maracá, Vida Corrida, Tia Ednas Association, and EMEF José Lins do Rego. The methodology derives from the Workshop for Multidimensional Self-Care for Teachers designed by Fernanda Scheffer in 2022, aiming at an accessible, broadened, and experiential view of health. The proposal aims to activate health in people, promote well-being, prevent disease, and strengthen education in integrative health, using a simple and effective theoretical-practical methodology. It expands understanding and practices of self-care based on physical, vital, metabolic, emotional, mental, and supramental dimensions, through a participatory approach. The workshop was designed in a sequence that combines vivencial, transdisciplinary, and popular education methods, anchored in Naturology, Integrative Health, community practices, and the Quantum Model of Health (Bignardi, UNIFESP), and popular health education. The procedure includes: (1) reception and sensorineural ambiance; (2) Farols presentation; (3) string dynamic to introduce health as a social network; (4) exploration of health dimensions through practices (self-massage, tasting, breathing, meditação, and gratitude); (5) closing and sharing. Activities were simple, applicable to daily life, and meant to empower participants and their communities. Theoretical Framework: The Integrated Health Experience, designed by naturologist Fernanda Scheffer Augusto da Rocha in 2022, was conceived to address health from a broadened, accessible, and experiential perspective. The proposal aims to activate health, promote well-being, prevent disease, and strengthen education in integrative health through a simple and effective theory-practice activity, based on accessible self-care practices. It is founded on a combination of knowledge that collectively promote a broadened understanding of health as a state of balance across physical, vital, mental, emotional, supramental, and spiritual dimensions. The theoretical bases include Amit Goswamis Quantum Model, which sees consciousness as the basis of reality; the Transdisciplinary Medicine Protocol (Bignardi & Ramos, UNIFESP), which guides care from a multidimensional and integral view; Freires pedagogy, which values protagonism, knowledge exchange, and collective development; Ayurvedic Medicines biotypology and view of the five elements; and Rudolf Steiners Anthroposophy, which considers physical, etheric, astral, and spiritual bodies and utilizes practices like meditação (Tratak) to promote balance, vitality, and clarity of mind. The Integrated Health Experience was developed to address the limited access to promoção da saúde and integrative care in peripheral territories of São Paulo, particularly in communities like Capão Redondo and Campo Limpo. These areas face significant social vulnerabilities, including reduced access to quality healthcare, low availability of educational initiatives focused on self-care, and weakened community networks. The conventional health model often overlooks multidimensional health approaches and fails to promote autonomy and empowerment among individuals. Additionally, the gap between the formal healthcare system and integrative practices creates barriers to accessing affordable and preventive care. This experience seeks to bridge this gap by offering a low-cost, replicable, and community-centered approach that strengthens social bonds, promotes multidimensional health, and empowers individuals to become active participants in their own care. Between 2024 and 2025, 15 workshops were held, offering 308 seats; 249 people participated, and 261 evaluations were collected. The average NPS was 92.3% and satisfaction 99.5%. Participants valued the welcoming approach, applicability, and effects, noting well-being, relaxation, self-awareness, and strengthening of social networks. The most preferred practices were self-massage, breathing, meditação, the string dynamic, and tasting. The methodology demonstrated strong engagement and replicability in community and educational settings. The Integrated Health Experience workshop achieved a 99.5% satisfaction rate and a 92.3% NPS, demonstrating strong impact on well-being, self-awareness, and social connection. Its accessible, experiential approach empowers participants through simple, multidimensional self-care practices. To scale this impact, the initiative should expand to underserved areas, ensuring sessions of 1.52 hours in welcoming spaces. Training local facilitators and providing educational materials will support replication. Integration into saúde pública strategies, particularly within SUS, can broaden access to integrative care. Its low-cost model and alignment with WHO guidelines make it a valuable tool for promoting equity and community health.",

    "abstract": "The Atmo Danai Educational Institute, based in the Federal District of Brazil, has over a decade of experience in training integrative and complementary health therapists, with a focus on Ayurveda, Integrative Massage, Bioenergetics, and Bodywork. Committed to promoting holistic health and social transformation, the Institute developed a pedagogical model that integrates technical training with supervised practice in public and institutional spaces. In response to the challenges of consolidating Traditional and Complementary Medicine (TCM) in Brazils Unified Health System (SUS)such as the shortage of trained professionals and limited public access to these practicesthe Institute created a pathway that connects education, service, and community impact. Its training model is based on three key dimensions: hands-on learning of over 28 techniques; development of human and ethical competencies such as empathy, active listening, and presence; and professional tools including anatomy, entrepreneurship, and communication. Through strategic partnerships with government bodies such as the Ministry of Health and the Department of Education of the Federal District, as well as through public events and community initiatives, students engage in real-life therapeutic experiences. These include actions like monthly open clinics, wellness programs in schools, and health intervençãos for civil servants. All sessions are supervised by experienced facilitators to ensure segurança, quality, and professional growth. In 2024 alone, more than 500 free tratamentos were delivered, generating positive institutional feedback and expanding recognition of integrative care. The experience shows that by embedding practice within education, it is possible to form skilled, ethical, and socially conscious therapistsstrengthening the presence of TCM in the saúde pública system and contributing to inclusive, human-centered, and sustainable care. One of the main challenges faced in integrating Traditional, Complementary, and Integrative Medicine (TCIM) into public healthcare in Brazil is the lack of qualified professionals and public awareness. Many communities, especially those in vulnerable situations, have limited access to TCIM services due to geographic, institutional, or informational barriers. Additionally, educational programs often emphasize technical content without offering real-life application in public contexts. This limits students ability to apply their knowledge in diverse social realities and weakens the presence of TCIM in government health policies and practices. In 2024 alone, over 500 free therapeutic sessions were provided by students in supervised settings. The initiative has reached a wide variety of peopleincluding civil servants, teachers, children, and older adultswith high satisfaction reported by participants. Partner institutions such as the Ministry of Health and the Department of Education in the Federal District have expressed interest in expanding collaboration. Students have shown significant growth not only in practical skills but also in ethical maturity, self-confidence, and community commitment. To improve and expand similar initiatives, we recommend:  Strengthening partnerships with public institutions through formal agreements.  Offering continuous pedagogical training for facilitators involved in field supervision.  Establishing clearer policies for logistical support, including transportation and infrastructure for mobile care units.  Creating awareness campaigns about TCIM in public spaces to increase population engagement.  Replicating the model in other regions through aligned educational institutions and saúde pública stakeholders. Despite logistical and institutional coordination challenges, the model has shown high potential for scalability and policy integration.",

    "abstract": "The reported experience is based on therapeutic sessions conducted both in-person (in private practices located in Paulínia and Campinas, São Paulo, Brazil) and online (via Google Meet platform). This regional context reflects Brazil's urban challenges, where women often face socioeconomic pressures exacerbated by familial and cultural dynamics. The methodology follows Bert Hellinger's systemic-phenomenological approach, using tools like symbolic figures, systemic questions, and metaphorical cards. The focus is on women experiencing recurrent emotional suffering, relationship difficulties, and financial blockagescommon issues in this demographic. The primary objective is to help participants reframe their life narratives within family systems, identifying unconscious loyalties, interrupted bonds, and hidden patterns affecting their emotional health, financial stability, and relationships. Clients reported significant improvements in emotional regulation, decision-making clarity, healthier boundaries, and resolution of long-standing personal/financial challenges. The online Family Constellation groups began during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, following the systemicphenomenological model developed by Bert Hellinger. Each group consists of up to 10 participants, with a primary focus on women, and runs for 10 weekly sessions (approximately three months), always on the same day. More than one group runs each week, with each meeting lasting two hours. Sessions follow a structured sequence: (1) a check-in round for participants to share how they are arriving emotionally, fostering awareness of feelings; (2) a 30-minute workshop on predetermined themes (e.g., What is Family Constellation, Orders of Love/Helping, Relationships with Mother/Father, Ancestry, Inner Child, Prosperity); (3) a short centering exercise; and (4) the constellation itself, using the water field technique and participants as representatives. The constellation begins with the constellated person and the theme, progressively adding family system representatives until the source of tension emerges. This is often revealed by strong emotions such as tears, anger, or rejection. Awareness is facilitated through symbolic repositioning and reframing statements, ending when the field becomes lighter and tension dissipates. A brief systemic exercise closes the session. Between 2020 and 2024, approximately 60 women participated, each attending between 1 and 10 constellations. Feedback is collected through spontaneous participant reports, follow-up conversations, and qualitativo testimonials. Examples include Many women between 35 and 65 years old sought Family Constellation terapia due to emotional suffering linked to unresolved family conflicts, financial instability, and transgenerational patterns. Among participants, 70% were married, while 30% were single and without children. Women over 55 were predominantly married or divorced mothers, with 80% of divorced participants coming from families where parental divorce had recurred across generations. These women reported feeling overwhelmed by repetitive cycles in relationships (especially romantic and financial ones), low self-esteem, and difficulties breaking free from inherited patterns of abandonment or scarcity. Common challenges included emotional dependence, inability to set boundaries, chronic ansiedade, and financial blockages tied to unconscious family loyalties. Older participants (55+) often faced additional struggles with life transitions, such as empty nest syndrome or late divorces, while middle-aged women grappled with identity reconstruction beyond marital roles. Participants reported significant improvements in emotional regulation (e.g., reduction in ansiedade symptoms), greater clarity in decision-making, and the establishment of healthier interpersonal boundaries (especially in marital relationships). The process facilitated the release of unconscious family loyalties linked to transgenerational patterns (particularly among divorced women from families with a history of divorce), fostering reconnection with inner resilience. Positive resultados extended to relational dynamics (80% of married participants reported improved conflict resolution) and financial behaviors (a 50% reduction in scarcity mindset, with cases of reentry into the labor market and resolution of financial issues). The intervenção consistently promoted empowerment, with clients describing renewed autonomy and a strengthened sense of belonging. Participant feedback is collected through spontaneous reports, follow-up conversations, and qualitativo testimonials. Below are some examples that illustrate common results: Silvia (2024): \"I had depressão and burnout syndrome; I suffered a lot, lost my job, and had to resign, which caused me even more suffering. I used to take medication to sleep and just to be able to get out of bed, and I was always very nervous and irritable. In 2020, a friend introduced me to Family Constellation, which helped me a lot. This allowed me to calm down and see myself more clearly. Today, I no longer take any medication, I sleep very well, and I can do things without fear. I am grateful to my friend who introduced me to Family Constellation and to Edna, who is my constellator and a wonderful person. Gratitude. Anonymous participant (2023): Described releasing repressed emotions, redefining self-worth, and healing deep, long-standing wounds. She now embraces self-care and self-love, feeling lighter, more confident, and happier. Lilian (2022): Before constellations, suffered from debilitating headaches lasting weeks, unresponsive to medical tratamento. Since starting sessions, she reports complete remission of these chronic headaches. Family Constellation has proven to be an effective and accessible complementary approach to emotional and mental healthcare, particularly for women. Although it is officially recognized by the Brazilian Unified Health System (SUS) as part of its Integrative and Complementary Practices (PICS), challenges remain due to limited understanding among health professionals and persistent prejudice in institutional settings. In December 2024, the Brazilian Academic Consortium on Integrative Health (CABSIN), in collaboration with BIREME/PAHO, published the first Evidence Map on the clinical efetividade of Family Constellation. This initiative aimed to consolidate available scientific knowledge and guide public policies and professional practices. The analysis included 16 studies, with 40 health resultados assessed. Of these, 75% showed potentially positive results for mental health, 15% had confirmed positive effects, and only 10% remained inconclusive. These results reinforce the importance of advancing research while acknowledging the existing impact of Family Constellation as a therapeutic resource. Therefore, it is recommended that Family Constellation be further integrated into comprehensive mental health strategies, especially to support women facing emotional overload, affective suffering, relational difficulties, and transgenerational financial blockages. Public institutions and mental health services should encourage evidence-informed training, reducing stigma and expanding access to practices that support self-care, autonomy, and emotional resilience among vulnerable populations.",

Sessions last between 25 and 60 minutes and integrate gentle joint mobilization, self-massage and deep guided relaxation focused on conscious breathing, atenção plena and emotional self-regulation. A specific protocol, RestauraZEN, developed from years of hospital-based experience, ensures segurança and methodological consistency. More than 140 sessions are conducted annually, benefiting an estimated 1,100 to 1,400 participants per year, including healthcare professionals, patients and caregivers. All facilitators undergo comprehensive theoretical and practical training that combines technical skill, ethics and sensitivity to the hospital environment. Hospital settings, especially in oncology care, expose both professionals and patients to chronic stress, emotional overload and physical exhaustion, often without access to structured, non-pharmacological strategies for self-regulation or relief. Healthcare teams face long shifts with limited opportunities for pause, while patients and caregivers experience ansiedade and vulnerability in high-pressure environments. The intervenção was designed to fill this gap by integrating safe, accessible and evidence-informed wellness practices into hospital routines, fostering emotional stability and physical recovery. A major challenge in implementation was institutional hesitation to allow external, volunteer-led programs in sensitive clinical contexts. Building trust required the creation of a rigorous protocol aligned with hospital standards, formal training for facilitators, and continuous evaluation to demonstrate segurança, efficacy and relevance for the hospital community. Over five years of continuous implementation, the initiative has demonstrated consistent and measurable impact. More than 140 annual sessions, averaging 710 participants each, provide over 1,000 individuals per year with direct access to guided relaxation and emotional regulation techniques. Post-session evaluations conducted with healthcare workers in 2025 revealed that 100% reported improved well-being and greater emotional balance immediately after practice, with many highlighting better focus and resilience during work. Qualitative feedback underscores these results: My life is divided into before and after these practices; I learned to control a panic attack with the breathing techniques; Just a few minutes completely change my day. Patients frequently report decreased pain, better sleep and a sense of lightness and calm, while caregivers describe moments of presence and reconnection amid ongoing stress. These resultados indicate that even brief, low-cost intervençãos can generate significant benefits for physical and emotional health in hospital settings. The experience highlights the importance of embedding structured wellness practices into public healthcare systems as a means of humanizing care and supporting those who give and receive it. Successful replication requires full alignment with hospital protocols, rigorous facilitator training in both technical and interpersonal skills, and ongoing communication with institutional leadership to maintain trust. Consistent documentation of participation and resultados strengthens credibility and sustainability, while adapting practices to different hospital spaces ensures accessibility for diverse patients and staff. The key lesson is that intentional moments of guided pause and breath, when offered with sensitivity and clinical awareness, can create profound shifts in emotional regulation and well-being, contributing to healthier work environments and more compassionate care pathways.",

    "abstract": "The experience in Grajaú (2015-2023) developed autonomously in two spaces: the community cultural center Espaço Cultural Cazuá and the public education facility CEU Navegantes, where activities were offered either free or through voluntary symbolic contributions without strict data control. Participation was predominantly female initially, becoming exclusively female by 2023. In 2024, the practice was adapted for Capão Redondo through Farol Saúde Integrativa's structured programming. Yogaterapia sessions combined postures (like \"Sphinx\" and \"Warrior\"), breathing exercises and final relaxation, using accessible props while allowing space for the instructor's professional adaptations. The approach maintained therapeutic foundations while adapting language and techniques for the local context. The project confronted multiple challenges: the Western elitization of yoga (Bernardi et al., 2021) that limits access for vulnerable populations; participants' limiting beliefs about needing an \"ideal body\" to practice; discontinuation due to health issues; notions of belonging; transportation difficulties; and schedule conflicts from work demands (both paid and domestic). These barriers were particularly acute for the female participants. The initiative sought to overcome these through adaptations that maintained yoga's therapeutic integrity (Iyengar, 2016) while making it accessible. In Grajaú, while no systematic data was collected, anecdotal reports indicated benefits including improved mental health among teachers, with one case of a teacher returning to work after burnout. In Capão Redondo (July 2024-March 2025), 29 sessions were held with 54 participants (49 women, 5 men), aged 27-82 (average 51.3). Engagement showed 5 participants attending >4 sessions and 31 attending once. Satisfaction surveys (136 evaluations) showed NPS 93.0 and average rating 9.91/10. Participants answered written evaluations containing two qualitativo questions. The first question asked \"Do you have any criticism, praise or suggestion for future activities\" with responses showing high satisfaction, particularly noting pain relief (37% of responses), relaxation (45%), and improved mobility (28%). Participants frequently used expressions like \"wonderful,\" \"gratitude,\" and \"left better than I arrived,\" emphasizing the activity's positive impact on self-care, healthy physical challenges, and emotional support. The second question asked \"What aspect did you enjoy most\" with participants highlighting: the deep final relaxation (52% of responses), therapeutic movements (especially stretches, twists and poses like \"Sphinx\" and \"Warrior\" - 38%), and the team's affective support (34%). Many reported immediate benefits like pain relief (41% mentioned this, especially lumbar pain), peacefulness, and greater self-connection, with phrases like \"left better than I arrived\" and \"forgetting the outside world.\" The combination of breathing and movement was widely praised, as was the instructor's patient methodology and innovative activities (like using balls and reflective cards). To address challenges, several solutions proved effective: anatomical adaptations to improve body literacy; modified language maintaining technical precision; strengthened community bonds; and sessions after 17:00 to accommodate work schedules.",

    "abstract": "Reiki is a Japanese therapeutic practice recognized by Brazils National Policy of Integrative and Complementary Practices (PNPIC) since 2017. It involves the ability to regulate and harmonize energy through areas that correspond with the known bodys chakras  energy centers aligned along the spine that regulate physical, emotional, and psychological balance. The practice stimulates the parasympathetic nervous system and supports the restoration of energetic homeostasis, contributing to deep relaxation, stress reduction, and overall well-being, as well as eliminating toxins from the body. This report presents the implementation of Reiki sessions at the ZENCancer Institute (IZC), a nonprofit dedicated to supporting cancer patients through integrative care. The ZENCancer Institute (IZC) is a nonprofit organization that emerged from the personal journey of one of its founders, who turned to Traditional, Complementary and Integrative Medicine (TCIM) as part of her healing process following a breast cancer diagnosis. Deeply moved by the impact of these practices on her well-being, she helped establish the IZC with the goal of expanding access to other cancer patients. The initiative is made possible through the collaboration of volunteers, who both deliver the therapies and participate in the institutes management. Upon joining, participants are greeted by the Welcoming Unit, which introduces them to the range of available therapies and guides their initial steps. Those interested in Reiki complete a specific intake form and receive guidance materials. The Reiki Coordination team then assigns a therapist, who initiates contact to schedule sessions. Treatments are conducted online and at a distance, lasting 3060 minutes weekly over a 12-week period, with the possibility of renewal depending on the participants needs. Reiki is also occasionally offered in person, particularly during Restorative Yoga group activities. Over 50 individuals have benefited from Reiki at IZC, with some receiving up to 36 sessions. Transitioning from in-person to online care during the COVID-19 pandemic was a major challenge, but it fostered resilience and innovation. The team adapted through commitment and the creation of structured communication and guidance materials, ensuring continued access. Cancer patients frequently experience a range of distressing symptoms, including ansiedade, fatigue, pain, sleep disturbances, and emotional imbalance. Reiki sessions at the ZENCancer Institute aim to address these multidimensional challenges by facilitating relaxation, reducing stress, and restoring energetic balance. Evidence suggests that Reiki may be effective in decreasing ansiedade and pain, improving sleep quality, and enhancing emotional well-being in oncology settings. The Reiki program has supported over 50 cancer patients. Participants often report feeling calmer, more centered, and better equipped to cope with the emotional and physical demands of tratamento. In addition to promoting well-being, the practice fosters a sense of community, emotional connection, and compassionate, non-invasive care that helps restore patients sense of agency and belonging during a vulnerable period. To replicate this model, key strategies include: team training; development of a clear and compassionate user guide; and establishing efficient communication channels between coordinators, therapists, and patients.",

    "abstract": "The intervenção took place in the Complementary and Integrative Care Unit (NUCCI) at the Adult Day Hospital Rehabilitation Center (CRHD), part of the Institute of Psychiatry at the University of São Paulo Medical School (IPq-HCFMUSP). A multidisciplinary team of 14 trained professionals facilitated weekly sessions for six weeks. Each session involved a blend of Mentha spicata L. and Salvia sclarea essential oils inhaled through cotton strips, tactile and visual elements (textured fabrics, colorful objects), music with positive emotional context, storytelling about the plants, and a concluding creative activity painting related allegories. The initiative aimed to provide physical, emotional, and mental balance to the patients while fostering voluntary engagement and social connection. Patients with severe psychiatric conditions often experience emotional dysregulation, tratamento resistance, and limited social interaction. Additionally, health professionals initially expressed skepticism about the clinical efetividade of integrative practices such as aromaterapia. Throughout the intervenção, increased patient participation, reduced avoidance, and improved affective expression were observed. Team engagement also grew as benefits became evident. Four weeks after the end of the sessions, patients retained memory of the experience and demonstrated ongoing improvements in emotional state and interpersonal communication. The structured multisensory aromaterapia protocol has proven effective and should be considered a complementary strategy for psychiatric care. Future programs should include standardized evaluation tools, and long-term follow-up to measure lasting impact. Key challenges include training staff and ensuring cultural adaptation of sensory elements. The approach is low-cost, reproducible, and adaptable to diverse health settings.",

    "abstract": "It is known that to develop studies in the Social Sciences, the Sciences of Dialogic, it is necessary to use four parameters: Connectivity, Passion, Confrontation and Horizontality, mainly in the case of a study that involves syncretism, it remains for the researcher to communicate, to relate in order to be able to appropriate and share knowledge from different sources, that is, it is advisable to have multidisciplinary approaches. Qigong is a practice of exercises with the body, mind and spirit, belonging to Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) with at least 8000 years of systematization. One of the most famous Classical Physicians of TCM, Hua Tuo (163 AD), was one of the pioneers in its systematization. In the second half of the 20th century, the Chinese government organized commissions to study and propagate QiGong at the provincial and national levels due to the good results that practitioners had in maintaining their health. After several records and surprising results in curing and preventing diseases, important stimuli began for the practice of this terapia spreading through public parks, also in hospitals. So, we are talking about one of the areas of Medicine Training at the Universities of China, Qi Gong (Chi Kung), which means skill developed through theoretical and practical studies, which results in the control of the flow of internal vital energy known by the Chinese as Qi (Chi). In order to obtain health benefits, medical Qi Gong is used, as it has therapeutic effects of health recovery and healing, which is a practice that emphasizes relaxation that facilitates the circulation of Qi, as well as controlling the respiratory rhythm, the coordination of smooth body movements, and the proper mental attitude. These qualities, put into practice in a conscious and coordinated way, generate the differential of Qi Gong terapia. The objective of this work is to present the Preliminary Results of a research that we started when accompanying elderly people who voluntarily and free of charge participate in a Zhineng Qi Gong Practice Group for the last three years, which is an activity that involves Relaxation (Field Organization), Light Physical Activities, called Methods by the creator os this sistem. It also envolves Body Practices of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Meditaciol and Visualization like activities. In this work we present an relato de experiência where knowledge was acquired online about Zhineng Qi Gong, during the pandemic, with teachers from China, and then, it has been shared online, free of charge, with open practices across Brazil, Latin America and Portugal. All these practices are suitable and adaptable to the physical conditions of any person. It was developed and has been disseminated throughout the world since the 1980s by Doctor Pang Ming, PhD, Doctor trained in Western Medicine and Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), University Professor and Founder of several Study and Research Centers. In China, for example, in Xian. In China there are thousands of practitioners, scholars and researchers who have disseminated these practices that today have benefited from them all over the world. In Brazil, as we have many elders without adecuated care taken by the government health institutes, this practice has been disseminated in the last five years through Professor Oscar Silva, from Mexico, and Cassiano Takayassu,Dr, from São Paulo. We participated in an International Zhineng Qigong Teather training course in Zhineng Qi Gong, Levels 1, 2 and 3, with Teachers from the XiAn Zhineng Science Research Center from october 2021 until october 2022. But, In February 2022 we openned a on line, free of charge, Practice Group, and disseminated this informationon internet, through Whatsapp, with activities four times a week (from Monday until Thursday, from 6:30 AM until 7:45 AM. We had several inscriptions, especially from the elderly people. During and after the practices we have seen the development of improvements of physical problems (less pain in the cervical, dorsal and lumbar regions, etc), as well as encreased vitality, more vital energy and joy in the state of mind and in the emotional field. As part of this research, we set up a questionnaire adapted from other research to reports, and part of the results and shared these preliminar results with the scientific community in this abstract / article. We also include in the article part of the integrative, and narrative reviews where we discussed the possibility of taking this Practice On Line, through the SUS structures, to more people, especially the elderly, aiming to bring greater well-being and more longevity with higher life quality. It appears that the most frequent reactions are WELL BEING, especially after. It is worth mentioning that some practitioners with more experience may report some differentiated benefits, for example, the decrease in the degree of glasses or Special States, deeper Qi Gong state. These processes are expected to occur, as the increasing accumulation of this vital energy allows for the recovery of health and the feeling of youth. During and after the practices, we have followed the development of improvements in physical problems (less pain in the cervical, dorsal and lumbar regions), as well as greater vitality, more energy and joy in the state of mind spetialy in elderly people, as we could see in the answers of this reseach. We discussed the possibility of taking this Practice On Line, possibly through the SUS (Public Health Care organization in Brazil) structures, to more people, especially the elderly, aiming to bring greater well-being and better qualidade de vida. We aim to get in touch with the official segments that disseminate the Integrative and Complementary Practices in Health (PICS) to take this activity through the Structures of the SUS, as well as through the Public Universities, to the Servers as a way of taking self-care, and through an Extension Project, taking this content to the communities as another opportunity to take care of their Health and Quality of life.",

    "abstract": "The Family and Community Medicine Residency Program of the Municipal Health Department of Rio de Janeiro (PRMFC/SMS-RJ) trains more than one hundred professionals annually to work in Primary Health Care (PHC) territories across the city. Until 2022, the teaching of Integrative and Complementary Health Practices (PICS) occurred sporadically, depending on the individual initiative and prior training of preceptors. In this context, the PRMFC coordination team partnered with the PICS Management Office of SMS-RJ to create the PICS Task Force (FT-PICS), with the following objectives: (1) systematize the teaching of PICS within the residencys theoretical curriculum; (2) offer introductory theoretical-practical training to first- and second-year residents (R1 and R2); (3) identify and integrate knowledge already present in the health network; (4) develop materials and strategies applicable to clinical practice in PHC. Between 2022 and 2024, five in-person seminars were held with theoretical and practical workshops on medical rationalities, foundations of traditional Chinese medicine, auriculoterapia, rational use of medicinal plants, cupping terapia, moxibustion, shantala massage, and self-massage, totaling 551 participants. Educational booklets and instructional videos were also produced and integrated into the residency's virtual learning platform (Moodle), in addition to support for workshops with nurses from the AP 1.0 health district. The aim of this report is to present the experience of implementing theoretical-practical seminars conducted by FT-PICS at PRMFC/SMS-RJ as a strategy for expanded health education. This relato de experiência follows the SQUIRE guidelines (Standards for Quality Improvement Reporting Excellence) (Ogrinc G, 2016). PHC faces increasing demand for comprehensive care due to the high prevalence of chronic conditions such as pain, insomnia, ansiedade, and headaches. Conventional responses, centered on medicalization, fail to address the subjective and social dimensions of illness. PICS offer safe and humanized alternatives (PNPIC, 2006), but their integration into health services is hindered by the lack of structured training and institutional resistance (WHO, 2023). While National Curriculum Guidelines propose comprehensive and humanized training (BRASIL, 2014), PICS remain marginalized in medical education. The integration of systems like Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) still faces obstacles such as lack of robust evidence, regulatory barriers, and cultural resistance (WHO, 2023; Mayo Clinic, 2024). To broaden access, it is essential to expand PICS training across other health professions, in alignment with each professions regulatory frameworks (BRASIL, 2018). Since its inception, FT-PICS has conducted five seminars between 2022 and 2024, engaging 551 FCM residents and PHC preceptors. The first edition included 109 participants, followed by sessions with 111, 87, 114, and 120 attendees. Workshops covered PICS with potential for immediate application in PHC and encouraged the development of residency final papers (TCRs), study groups, and local replication by preceptors. This collaboration strengthened the link between the Residency Program and the Municipal Health Department, fostering technical exchange and joint development of educational materials. Resources produced included an auriculoterapia booklet (SUBPAV, 2024), a medicinal plants guide, and video tutorials on shantala massage (VALDÉS, 2024), cupping, and moxibustion (SOUZA, 2024). These materials were made available on Moodle and institutionalized for use in health facilities. The experience strengthened teaching autonomy and broadened the residents therapeutic repertoire, contributing to a more coherent education aligned with PHC principles. The workshop format, led by preceptors from the program, allowed for adaptations to local realities and offered a practical, experience-based approach to care. Among the challenges identified in this report are the limited knowledge of many professionals about PICS, which can generate initial resistance. Additionally, infrastructure limitations and logistical issuessuch as restrictions on moxibustion in smoke-detecting environmentswere noted. Interprofessional articulation also proved difficult in some units, which compromised the integration of PICS into collective care. This experience highlights the need to institutionalize PICS training as part of residency curricula, in line with Ordinance GM/MS nº 971, of May 3, 2006, which promotes PICS expansion across all levels of care, with emphasis on atenção primária. According to Aguiar, Kanan, and Masiero (2019), continuing education is a powerful strategy for consolidating PICS in PHC. It is recommended to expand training strategies to other professional categories and multiprofessional residency teams, promoting the overcoming of the biomedical paradigm and expanding care and promoção da saúde resources (AGUIAR; KANAN; MASIERO, 2019; SOUZA et al., 2017). Additionally, the publication of a quick reference PICS guide is suggested, modeled after SUBPAV/SMS-RJ materials and based on FT-PICS content already produced. Strengthening partnerships with networks such as ObservaPICS, CABSIN, and GAIPA-UFC is also recommended to enhance knowledge exchange and consolidate PICS as a structuring axis in SUS-based health education.",

    "abstract": "Forest Bathing, also known as Shinrin-yoku, is a Japanese practice that involves immersing oneself in the forest atmosphere through conscious activation of the senses. It is not merely about walking or engaging in physical exercise, but about reconnecting with nature through sight, hearing, taste, smell, and touch. Shinrin-yoku serves as a bridge between humans and nature and is the foundation of Forest Medicine, an interdisciplinary science focused on promoting physical and mental health based on evidence. In the context of the Primary Health Care Unit (UBS), the activity was carried out with adults over the age of 50, presenting diverse health conditions. The idea originated from a team member who was already familiar with the practice and recognized the importance of offering it to users as a form of integrative care. The ecological park, accessible and well-structured, features a sensory trail with natural obstacles such as tree roots, water puddles, and tactile objects that stimulate the senses through barefoot walking and blindfolded experience. The planning began at the start of the year, with an invitation extended to users to join a care group. A partnership was established with a transportation company to provide a bus with a capacity for 44 people. The group included one nursing assistant, two pharmacists, and three community health agents. Attendance was confirmed via phone calls and home visits. On March 14, the visit took place and lasted five hours. Upon arrival, participants were welcomed with a body awareness activity. The park team gave an orientation about the experience, explaining guidelines and segurança measures. Two guides individually accompanied each user along the trail, which lasted approximately two hours. Blindfolded and barefoot, participants were led through a path where they were stimulated by the sounds of water and wind, the smell of firewood and leaves, the feel of the earth, and the taste of offered fruits. At the end of the trail, participants removed their blindfolds and faced a mirror, symbolizing a reconnection with themselves. The activity concluded with a group conversation circle, a shared snack, auriculoterapia, and contemplative walking. Reactions ranged from initial ansiedade to deep emotional responses, with reports of childhood memories, a sense of peace, and reconnection with nature and ones own senses.  Disconnection from nature and from oneself;  Stress, emotional tension, and sedentary habits;  Lack of integrative non-pharmacological strategies in patient care. It is recommended to expand the practice of Forest Bathing to other groups within the health unit, integrating medical and integrative approaches in user care. It is also suggested to diversify the schedules and days for outdoor activities in order to increase participation. Strategies like this strengthen the connection with the territory, promote comprehensive health, and support person-centered care.",

    "abstract": "The Oswaldo Cruz Institute (IOC), through the Health Promotion and Social Cooperation Advisory (APSCS), has been engaged in the Promotion of Integrative and Complementary Health Practices (PICS), with a focus on enhancing health and well-being among employees and students, including scholarship recipients, retirees, and outsourced staff involved in management, teaching, and research. In this context, Reiki courses at levels I, II, IIIA, and IIIB have been offered to train individuals in the practice and to support outpatient care both in-person and remotely. Additionally, certified Reiki practitioners participate in events across Fiocruz campuses, demonstrating institutional support for the dissemination of PICS. Reiki is a technique that utilizes Universal Energy, and from level I onward, its practice aims to foster physical, emotional, and spiritual balance for practitioners. This report underscores the importance of qualified Reiki practitioners who can serve as disseminators of the practice, thereby contributing to the promotion of health and well-being within the institution. Since April 2017, the APSCS has developed and progressively expanded access to Reiki training for individuals affiliated with Fiocruz, offering all levels of the course. Course promotion has been conducted via institutional communication channels. The curriculum combines theoretical and practical components rooted in the traditional system established by Mikao Usui, encompassing the philosophy of the five principles and the 125 poems associated with Emperor Meiji. The training duration is 30 hours for levels I, II, and IIIA, and 60 hours for level IIIB. Classes are delivered by an active IOC employee qualified as a Reiki Master in both Brazil and Japan, through online platforms and in-person sessions, ensuring an accessible, low-cost program. Courses are convened biannually, and in 2019, a dedicated class for individuals with hearing impairments (PPDA), supported by sign language interpreters, was conducted. Between March 2020 and July 2022, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, all activities shifted to online formats to adhere to segurança protocols, increasing remote Reiki teaching and care. In-person sessions resumed with the support of alumni volunteers, with records maintained both in physical logs and digital platforms. Starting in 2022, trained Reiki practitioners have also participated in various ceremonial events at different Fiocruz units, providing Reiki practice as part of institutional activities. The impossibility of providing care, as hospitals were overwhelmed with emergency care during the COVID pandemic, the insufficient public investment in adequate infrastructure and facilities at the institution's headquarters hindered the development and practice of Reiki among employees, students, scholarship recipients, retirees, and outsourced staff involved in management, teaching, and research. To address this, we transitioned the practice to an online format, providing an opportunity for many participants to enhance their well-being. This approach helped alleviate feelings of depressão and isolation, fear, sadness, anguish, and ansiedade generated by isolation, resulting from the suspension of in-person activities during the COVID-19 pandemic. Over the past 8 years, the APSCS has provided training for Reiki practitioners to individuals belonging to the IOC and other units of Fiocruz, such as the Fernandes Figueira Institute for Women, Children and Adolescents (IFF), National Institute of Infectiology (INI), General Coordination of Campus Infrastructure, Farmanguinhos, Biomanguinhos, Atlantic Forest Unit, National School of Public Health, and for other states such as Bahia, Pernambuco, Fortaleza, Minas Gerais, and Manaus within the same institution. Thus, 726 Reiki certificates have been issued, distributed among levels I = 311, II = 205, IIIA = 148, and IIIB = 62, totaling 30 classes, including one class with 8 PPDA. We observed that the majority of Reiki graduates were employees (32.21%) of the IOC (43.43%) and women (88.65%). To date, we have recorded about 5,136 in-person sessions at the IOC unit and 810 in other units, both in Reiki, with the support of Reiki practitioners trained by the institution. Furthermore, this practice has been present at events held at the Fiocruz campuses on commemorative dates such as Nursing Day, International Women's Day, IFF Centenary, Labor Day, anniversaries of Fiocruz and the IOC, Fiocruz for You, as well as other events, totaling 1,086 sessions. Remote sessions were conducted, but their data are not included in this scope. This report highlights the pivotal role of APSCS in the dissemination of PICS through the ongoing availability of Reiki training and practice sessions, both in-person and remotely. The initiative has achieved significant engagement, with over 6,200 participants in Reiki sessions and 726 individuals trained. The network of Reiki practitioners fosters a culture of self-care and positive interpersonal interactions, including support for groups such as PPDA. During periods of social isolation, remote Reiki played a crucial role in addressing emotional and spiritual needs, contributing to the overall well-being of participants. Demonstrate to IOC management the critical significance of expanding and sustaining Reiki programs for institutional personnel to enhance overall health conditions. Recognize that the Institutional staff, due to operational workload, have limited access to Reiki practices, which may contribute to burnout in the absence of supportive measures. Additionally, investing in specialized professional training presents a logistical and financial challenge within the context of a public institutional framework.",

    "abstract": "Integrative and Complementary Health Practices (PICS) are therapeutic approaches aimed at preventing health issues, promoting well-being, and supporting the recovery of health, with an emphasis on active listening, the strengthening of therapeutic bonds, and the integration of the individual with their environment and community. Officially incorporated into Brazils Unified Health System (SUS) through the National Policy on Integrative and Complementary Practices (PNPIC)¹, these practices are currently available in 29 different modalities, offered free of charge to the population.² In the Amazon, the term \"traditional peoples\" refers to groups who, although not Indigenous, preserve lifestyles, cultural practices, and orally transmitted knowledge deeply rooted in their territories and closely connected to the local ecosystem.³ Among these groups, the *ribeirinhos* (riverine peoples) stand out for maintaining ancestral health practices, such as the use of medicinal teas, oils, prayers, therapeutic baths, and rituals, often associated with the power of the forest, water, and natural cycles. Recognizing the strength of this traditional knowledge and the importance of valuing it within healthcare, we conducted an integrative health circle with the community, creating a space for listening, sharing, and knowledge exchange. During this gathering, community members shared their experiences and traditional practices, explaining how they use them in daily life. The concept of integrative health was then presented, emphasizing its alignment with local wisdom, and the community was invited to participate, experiment, and co-create with us a broader, dialogical, and culturally respectful model of care. The Amazone-se project experience, carried out in the community of Anã, aimed to provide comprehensive care by integrating practices such as Reiki, herbal foot baths, phytoenergetics, auriculoterapia, and atenção plena with clinical services in gynecology, ultrasound imaging, nutrition, and physioterapia. A total of 433 services were provided, bridging clinical care with local knowledge. For this to be effective, active listening and collaborative work with the community were essential in understanding their needs and adapting the practices offered to their specific realities. Objectives To report the experience of the Amazone-se project in Vila Anã, highlighting the integration of integrative practices with clinical care for the riverine population, respecting their traditional knowledge and promoting a broader understanding of health. Methodology This is a descriptive study in the form of an relato de experiência, based on the *Amazone-se* project carried out in Vila Anã, Pará. The target population consisted of residents from the riverine community, attended by a multidisciplinary health team. Data were collected through participant observation, field diary notes, and testimonials from community members. Active listening was employed during the consultations, enabling more humanized and respectful care. The integrative practices offered were aligned with the National Policy on Integrative and Complementary Practices (PNPIC)¹, aiming at the co-creation of care together with the community. The analysis was conducted through reflection on the challenges, perceptions, and impacts generated by the intervenção. Results The experience developed with the community allowed for an expanded approach to healthcare, going beyond traditional biomedical models by integrating the physical, emotional, social, and cultural dimensions of the therapeutic process. The practices offered provided pain relief, reduced ansiedade, induced deep relaxation, and fostered an enhanced sense of well-being among participants. Reiki and auriculoterapia were particularly well received, frequently reported as effective in reducing symptoms of ansiedade and dor crônica. The herbal foot bath, when combined with phytoenergetics, had a significant symbolic and emotional impact, as it directly engaged with ancestral practices already recognized and applied in the community, such as the use of medicinal herbs and therapeutic baths. This integration strengthened the connection between popular knowledge and the health teams technical expertise, promoting mutual exchange and appreciation. Before individual consultations began, a group atenção plena session was conducted, inviting participants to connect with the present moment, to perceive the surrounding forest, to listen to its sounds and inhale its aromas, and to pay attention to their breathing and bodily sensations. This moment of pause and full presence fostered emotional readiness for care and created a sensitive, respectful, and welcoming atmosphere. The integrative approach proved powerful in building therapeutic bonds between professionals and community members, generating a climate of trust, attentive listening, and mutual recognition. Active listening, as both a methodological and ethical practice, proved essential for capturing the uniqueness of each person, enabling more sensitive and context-appropriate care. Many participants reported not only physical relief but also a sense of belonging and reconnection with their beliefs, as if the practices had rekindled dormant knowledge and affections. This symbolic care, combined with the perceived efficacy of the practices, significantly contributed to adherence to the therapies offered. Thus, the experience reinforces the importance of recognizing and incorporating Integrative and Complementary Practices in healthcare for traditional populations, respecting their ways of life, spirituality, knowledge systems, and healing practices. Conclusions The integration between integrative practices and clinical care proved effective in promoting comprehensive healthcare. Respect for traditional knowledge and the co-creation of care strategies were essential for the success of the initiative. Active listening and collaboration were central to delivering more humanized and effective care. This experience underscores the need for public policies that support the implementation of PICS in traditional territories, expanding access to humanized and holistic care. Future studies may further assess the impact of these practices on the qualidade de vida of the populations served. Include popular and community knowledge as an integral part of healthcare, promoting training initiatives that value ancestral knowledge and encourage intercultural dialogue between professionals and communities. Encourage the formation of multidisciplinary teams with competencies in active listening, holistic care, and integrative practices, ensuring approaches that are sensitive to local realities. Expand spaces for community participation, such as dialogue circles, workshops, and knowledge exchange gatherings, strengthening residents leadership in the development of healthcare strategies.",

    "abstract": "The progressive deterioration of contemporary lifestyles has significantly increased the prevalence of chronic diseases, notably impacting individuals' physical, mental, and spiritual well-being. In response to this panorama, complementary and integrative therapies, such as Acupuncture and Moxibustion, emerge, are validated, and reassert themselves as objectively valuable and subjectively effective alternatives for restoring holistic health balance. Within the framework of the XVIII International Congress of the Hispano-American Acupuncture Association Beijing'84, held in Cuenca, Spain, in October 2022, the necessity of offering an innovative response to the severe chronic deterioration linked to currently adopted lifestyles was raised. It was recognized that human beings, by their natural design, possess within themselves the necessary resources and capacities to re-evaluate, rectify, remodel, rehabilitate, and project themselves as healthy beings. This study qualitativoly analyzes the perceptions and experiences of therapists applying the \"To Fall Ill in the 21st Century, Lifestyles\" (ESXXIEV) tratamento, evaluating its impact on various diseases and the clinical evolution of the patients attended. 3. Methodology Intervenção Terapêutica (ESXXIEV): The ESXXIEV tratamento is based on a humanistic and energetic vision. It involves the application of indirect moxibustion to specific acupuntura points: 4TM (Mingmen) \"The Gate of Destiny\" and 8RM (Shén Qè), \"Fusion with the Breath\" or \"Gate of the Palace of Emotions\". Additionally, needling is performed at 20TM (Baihui), \"The Hundred Meetings\"; 4C (Shenmen), \"Sense of the Spirit\" or \"Path of the Spirit\"; 4B (Gong Sung), \"Universal Offering\"; and 7TR (Hui Zong), \" Meeting with Our Ancestors\". This tratamento was applied weekly for 3 months. Data Collection: Data collection focused on exhaustively documenting the experiences, attitudes, and practices of therapists during the application of the ESXXIEV tratamento. A dual and complementary strategy was employed to capture patient evolution through the therapists' perceptions: 1.1 Focal Groups: Two meetings were held with focal groups composed of therapists from the 20 participating countries. 1.2 Structured Interview (Google Forms): Key perceptions and observations emerging from the focal groups were condensed and tabulated through a structured interview, administered exclusively to therapists via a Google Form. Data Analysis: Analysis was performed using a qualitativo-phenomenological approach: Qualitative Analysis: Transcriptions from the focal groups and textual responses from the Google Form underwent inductive thematic analysis, influenced by the principles of Grounded Theory. Participants: The reference population consisted of 100 therapists who attended a total of 4,668 patients across 50 clinical centers of the Neijing Schools, distributed in 20 countries in Europe and America. Participants presented with various chronic pathologies, including oncological, cardiovascular, mental, neurodegenerative diseases, and dor crônica syndromes. All participants signed informed consent forms, ensuring the reliability and confidentiality of the collected data. The study was conducted in accordance with the ethical principles established in the Declaration of Helsinki. It is important to highlight that the execution of this research proposal represented a significant challenge, as it constituted the first multicenter experience for our Institution across its locations in 20 countries. Furthermore, a primary limitation identified was the absence of a research format that would allow for an in-depth evaluation of the energetic responses of the self, which are not quantifiable by conventional methods. It is worth mentioning that the research was carried out without external funding, relying exclusively on internal resources. Finally, no conflicts of interest of any kind are declared. The results revealed a consensus on the remarkable efficacy of the ESXXIEV tratamento in improving patients' lifestyle and qualidade de vida. High patient adherence was observed, interpreted as a direct reflection of the relevance and positive resultado of the approach. The versatility and multivalence of the tratamento allowed for its adaptation to individual needs, demonstrating consistent improvements across various dimensions. Therapists highlighted improvements in: Physical Health: sleep quality, eating habits, and vitality. Mental and Emotional Health: stabilization of mood states and significant reduction in ansiedade. Spiritual and Existential Well-being: increased awareness of lifestyle and the desire and purpose to live. Affectivity and Sexuality: related to the awareness of experiencing feelings in the realm of intimacy and their degree of enjoyment and fullness. Social Role: improvement in interrelationship and interdependence bonds through the harmonization of overall well-being. A particularly positive response was found in women. It is recommended to strengthen the work of multidisciplinary teams to implement health prevenção and promotion actions, integrating physical activity, conscious eating, meditação, and self-care education. The importance of focusing resources and tools especially on women's well-being is emphasized, thereby promoting the replication and expansion of the tratamento from a preventive and integral perspective. 4. Contribution to the Field This experience demonstrates that the ESXXIEV tratamento holistically improves health and prevents future ailments, contributing to the advancement of integrative therapies. The holistic approach is highlighted for promoting sustainable well-being and rapid improvement in qualidade de vida, with positive effects at both individual and community levels, regardless of tratamento duration.",

    "abstract": "The Outpatient telemonitoring clinic and the Integrative and complementary health practices (PICS) were developed based on a mapping of health conditions of the Black population in Bahia, combined with an extensive literature review to identify the most suitable PICS for implementation in the proposed therapeutic setting. This process also involved selection of the facilitators and the definition of their competencies to deliver PICS effectively. Launched in March 2025, this initiative aims to promote self-care, health self-management, and the revitalization of ancestral and traditional practices, using PICS to support the management of chronic conditions (Brazil, 2015). Participants of all ages, genders, sexual orientations, races, and ethnic backgrounds, regardless of their affiliation with social movements or collectives, were invited to participate through outreach on social media and recruited via an online registration form. The services are provided weekly. They are free of charge, and designed to be inclusive, combining both in-person and telemonitoring components. This includes the use of many tools, among others the electronic questionnaires to assess participants profiles and clinical characteristics such as, the qualidade de vida and sleep, the levels of pain, stress, ansiedade, and depressão. These tools also contribute to mapping the prevalence of the chronic noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), as well as the participants living conditions and the functional health status of the same patients. The PICS offered at the outpatient monitoring clinic included: Yoga and Meditation, which support stress management, improve sleep quality, and reduce inflammation, positively impacting overall well-being (Barros et al., 2014); Anthroposophic Medicine, which fosters an integrative approach by considering the balance between body, mind, and spirit (Dos Santos & Paineiras-Domingos, 2024); Reiki and Manual Therapy, which help relieve dor crônica, reduce ansiedade, and improve circulation (Freitag et al., 2014); and Reflexology, which stimulates energy points on the feet and hands, alleviating symptoms and contributing to the overall balance of the body (Dacal & Silva, 2018). The outpatient clinic addresses the high prevalence of chronic noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) among the Black population, particularly in Salvador, Bahia, where this group faces significant social vulnerability. These chronic conditions severely impact qualidade de vida and are closely linked to social, emotional, economic, and environmental determinants (Pasquetti et al., 2021). Compounding this issue is the persistence of the traditional biomedical model in many healthcare settings, which often fails to consider the holistic nature of individuals in their healthcare pathway. In this context, there is a pressing need to broaden access to integrative therapeutic practices, such as Integrative and complementary health practices (PICS), as effective alternatives for the prevenção, symptom relief, and management of NCDs. These practices support the physical, mental, and emotional well-being of the population. Another critical issue is the lack of equity in healthcare access. In response, initiatives like this outpatient clinic play a key role in upholding the right to health by offering free, inclusive, and high-quality care, particularly to historically underserved populations. The outpatient clinic represents a strategic social intervenção, providing multidisciplinary, accessible, integrative and inclusive care. One major impact of this initiative is the implementation of weekly telemonitoring, made possible by the fact that all participants have access to basic digital technologies at home. This enables continuous support for the monitoring of self-care and health self-management practices sustained in participants daily routines. Another major impact is the generation of acadêmico and scientific output, including peer-reviewed articles and educational materials, aligned with the universitys dual mission to both provide care to the community and produce scientifically grounded knowledge, to support baseado em evidence clinical decision-making and to contribute to the formulation and improvement of inclusive saúde pública policies. Integrative and Complementary Health Practices (PICS) are therapeutic approaches that use traditional, ancient, and ancestral techniques as strategies to promote health and well-being. Consequently, they are also used in disease prevenção. PICS were incorporated into Brazil's Unified Health System (SUS) through the National Policy for Integrative and Complementary Health Practices (PNPICS), established in 2006 by the Ministry of Health. This policy aims to expand and strengthen therapeutic approaches that complement conventional tratamentos, allowing for a comprehensive view of individual health and promoting practices grounded in both traditional and scientific knowledge, thereby challenging the conventional biomedical model. The PNPICS recognizes 29 modalities of PICS, including Yoga, Meditation, Anthroposophy, Ayurveda, Reiki, Manual Therapy, and Reflexology. Chronic Noncommunicable Diseases (NCDs) are long-term conditions with a slow progression, such as systemic arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus, obesity, cancer, metabolic syndrome, osteoarthritis, and respiratory diseases like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Additionally, fibromyalgia and systemic lupus erythematosus, which are especially prevalent in the Black population, are also classified as chronic conditions. These diseases can significantly impact an individual's qualidade de vida and are strongly influenced by many factors, such as social, emotional, economic, and environmental factors. The proposed outpatient clinic, an initiative of the Health of the Black Population and Chronic Diseases Research Group, is being implemented at the Federal University of Bahia.",

    "abstract": "In the tratamento of obesity, hypnoterapia stands out as a complementary practice, which can be conducted by psychologists in an integrated manner with therapeutic plans, respecting the uniqueness and subjective availability of each patient. This work aims to report the use of hypnoterapia as a therapeutic tool in the tratamento of obesity, promoting emotional self-management and self-care. This relato de experiência describes the use of hypnoterapia as a complementary practice in a hospital specialized in the tratamento of obesity. The experience involved individual psychological care using hypnoterapia in patients hospitalized for a period of up to six months, with multidisciplinary support, very low-calorie diets, between January 2020 and November 2022. Hypnoterapia was applied, biweekly, to 120 patients of both sexes, aged 18 years, during consultations with psychologists, lasting sixty minutes. Hypnoterapia was used as an auxiliary resource to psychoterapia, focusing on emotional regulation, self-esteem, binge eating and motivation for lifestyle changes. The proposal was approved by the Research Ethics Committee (opinion no. 7,498,693) and aimed to expand therapeutic resources to deal with eating impulses, ansiedade, hopelessness and low self-esteem, commonly present in the weight loss process. The patients in this study reported a history of failure in previous attempts to reduce weight and demonstrated resistance to new lifestyle changes. In this sense, it was necessary to promote emotional self-management and self-care necessary to maintain the healthy clinical weight acquired during hospitalization through behavioral changes. Hypnotic intervençãos contributed to the redefinition of experiences, access to states of tranquility and the reorganization of beliefs, aspects necessary for lifestyle changes. Among the patients who received Hypnoterapia, spontaneous reports were observed that evidenced emotional relief (80%), improved sleep (39%), reduced food ansiedade (50%) and greater willingness to do physical activities (60%). Half of the patients reported using self-hypnosis exercises in moments of tension, referring to a feeling of stability and security. The implementation of hypnosis in the tratamento of obesity required adaptation of the environment, professional training and continuous monitoring. The space was equipped with a chair adapted to support up to 300 kg, in addition to sound and lighting environments configured for reception and relaxation. It was necessary to carry out a training course in hypnoterapia for the team of psychologists, aiming to guarantee the segurança and efetividade of the care provided. During the entire hospitalization, continuous monitoring was carried out with active listening to the demands and desires of the patients, within a perspective of expanded therapeutic care. It is important to emphasize that obesity tratamento institutions have qualified professionals and integrated therapeutic plans, favoring the ethical, safe and qualified use of hypnoterapia. When used with technical and ethical responsibility, hypnoterapia enhances humanized care and can strengthen the subjective experience of change. Thus, hypnoterapia is configured as a relevant resource in the comprehensive and humanized care of patients with obesity.",

    "abstract": "This report is based on an experimental application of Discourse Semiotics (GREIMAS, 1975) as a methodology for producing meaning from the Drum Grammar (SIMAS, 2019), as evidenced during the course Drum Circle for Health Promotion, which took place in the first semester of 2025 at the Institute of Psychiatry (IPUB) of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ). The music terapia intervenção was inspired by the reflections of Byung-Chul Han (2021) on the societal illness resulting from the Disappearance of Rituals, aiming to explore the music therapeutic resources inherent in the cultural manifestations of Afro-Amerindian-Diasporic rhythmic communities. This initiative was carried out within the scope of the university community outreach project COMunicaSOM, affiliated with the UFRJ Music Therapy program. Throughout the course dynamics, it was possible to deepen and enrich the understanding of the therapeutic application of symbolic content, based on the concept of Music as Metaphor (BARCELLOS, 2009), as produced during collective drum-based music terapia practice. Based on the complexity of Drum Grammars and the music terapia premises of Drum Circles, it was possible to identify contradictions, oppositions, implications, and logical negations resulting from the application of the Semiotic Squarea fundamental component of Greimass (1975) Generative Path of Meaningwhich revealed valuable meanings for clinical music terapia practice. Greimassian Semiotics was applied through the identification of dialectical oppositions unveiled in the symbolic dimension of the Drum Grammar, which can be understood as conveying metaphors and meanings associated with the musical gestures (BARCELLOS, 2009) of drumming. In order for Discourse Semiotics to be understood as a methodology for signifying the Grammars of Drum Circles, it is first necessary to produce a cartography that deepens and highlights the epistemological complexity of the chosen ethno-cultural rhythmic tradition. This condition is essential for enriching the research from a decolonial perspective, with the aim of revealing new pathways for music terapia grounded in bioethics and cognitive justice.",

    "abstract": "Laboratório Amanhecer  Integrative, Complementary and Alternative Therapies in Health (LAPITAS) of the Health Sciences Center at UFSC (Ordinance n° 093/2025/CCS), has been operating since 1996 offering healthcare practices based on Traditional and Complementary Medicine (TCM). The beginning of this 29-year journey was as a University Extension project within the hospital, offering services to nursing professionals who worked in the Emergency Room of the Polydoro Ernani de São Thiago University Hospital of the Federal University of Santa Catarina (HU-UFSC). From 2004 onwards, its scope of action was expanded, with its care model adapted to the acadêmico context of UFSC (faculty, students, technical-administrative staff, HU-UFSC employees). In 2012, it started serving civil society communities. The driving force of Amanhecer is the work of social volunteers and professional volunteers who form a multidisciplinary health team, intending to serve the triad: higher education, extension activities, and research. Over 29 years, 50 individual and collective alternative therapies have been offered. This demonstrates the therapeutic breadth of Amanhecer, which allows it to be a field for countless scientific researches, especially in the areas of health and social sciences. In this context, Course Conclusion Papers, Mandatory and Non-Mandatory Internships were carried out by students of Undergraduate Courses, Multiprofessional Health Residencies and Post-doctoral programs. Amanhecer also collaboratively participated in internal events at UFSC and State and National Congresses (hosted in Florianópolis), making therapies available to the participants of the events. Amanhecer is recognized as an organized health service that offers assistance, education, and work through integrative health, promoting a natural form of disease and injury prevenção, enabling health recovery through safe means using natural resources, in which there is a search for care away from medicalization practices and the biologicist model. As Amanhecer does not deal with conventional therapies, there is frequently a search for partnerships by the University Hospital, allowing the medical axis extra contribution, with complementary therapies contributing to the health and well-being of users. Therefore, this pillar is, above all, a return to the origin of Medical Science knowledge, allowing immersion in complementary oriental, western, and psychological health techniques. The purpose of the present work is to report the quantitative evolution of services provided in the period from 2022 to 2024. Thus, we took the years 2020 and 2021 as a reference, because due to the Covid-19 pandemic, there was a reduction in the total number of services. It is worth noting that during this period, only therapies that could be performed asynchronously or remotely were offered. In this scenario, the total sum of services performed in 2020 and 2021 was 2.173. With the gradual return to in-person activities, 11 therapies were offered in 2022, totaling 1,275 services. This low number of services can be justified, in part, by the slow return of participants to in-person activities, as well as by the change in physical space. Up until 2019, Amanhecer was entirely based at HU-UFSC, and from 2022 onwards, its activities were distributed among other sectors of UFSC, which generated orientation difficulties for participants regarding the service location8. However, the relevance of Amanhecer as a health service, recognized by the community, led to exceeding expectations in recent years8. In 2023 and 2024, 15 and 17 therapies were offered, respectively. The therapies offered totaled 2.439 services in 2023 and 3.247 services in 2024. When comparing the number of services in 2022 with 2024, we verified that there was a 60% increase in services for the last year. This indicates an increasing demand for TCM practices at Amanhecer, as well as the quality of the services. The therapies offered by Amanhecer in the evaluated period were individual, collective, and in group, cited below. Individual therapies: Quantum Apometry; Hypnoterapia; Homeopathy; Floral Therapy (traditional, Bach flower remedies); Natural Therapy (Floral and Phytoterapia); Quantum Therapy (Caring Hands/Neural Silence/Reiki). Collective therapies: Reiki and Quantum Apometry. Group therapies: Biodanza; Family Constellation; Circular Dance of Peace Meditation in Movement (Ruhaniat International); Meditative Circular Dance of Tärä Dhatu; Hatha Yoga; Kundalini Yoga; Meditation and Deep Relaxation; Tai Chi Chuan. The data on therapies reported in this work point to a consolidated partnership of volunteer professionals in Care, which significantly contributes to community health. It is extremely important to monitor results and integrate research projects into the Laboratório Amanhecer, and the provided sources indicate that Amanhecer already fulfills and values these aspects. The document itself is titled \"Relatório do quantitativo evolucional de atendimentos do Laboratório Amanhecer nos anos de 2022 a 2024\", which demonstrates that quantitative results monitoring is an established practice. This monitoring allowed for the verification of a 60% increase in services between 2022 and 20243, indicating an \"ascending demand for TCM practices at Amanhecer, as well as the quality of services\". This highlights the importance of continuing to track this data to evidence the relevance and impact of the service. Furthermore, Amanhecer is recognized for intending to serve the \"triad: higher education, extension activities, and research\", meaning that research is a fundamental pillar since its conception. The sources explicitly state that the Laboratory \"allows itself to be a field for numerous scientific researches, especially in the areas of health and social sciences\". More specifically, the integration of research projects already occurs actively, with the completion of: Undergraduate Thesis Works (TCC). Mandatory and Non-Mandatory Internships by undergraduate students. Multiprofessional Residencies in the Health area. Post-doctorates. Therefore, Laboratório Amanhecer already demonstrates a strong commitment to monitoring its results and integrating research projects, which are crucial elements for its continuous acadêmico and social validation. Maintaining and expanding this research integration allows not only to document the impact of the therapies offered but also to generate new knowledge in the field of integrative healt",

    "abstract": "Transessential Therapy - TTE (Terapia Transessencial) is a bio-psycho-spiritual model that includes the dimension of consciousness approach centered on self-awareness and personal transformation, applied in both individual and group settings. Its theoretical foundations include Gestalt Therapy, Integrative Community Therapy, Positive Psychiatry, Vibrational Medicine, Integrative and Complementary Practices, the Philosophy of Care, Neuroscience, and the study of Spirituality. This approach was developed through the authors theoretical and clinical experience over the past four decades, through neuropsychiatric and psychotherapeutic care, as well as the facilitation of workshops, training sessions, and therapeutic groups focused on personal and collective self-discovery and transformation. Her engagement with Integrative Community Therapy, both as a therapist and trainer also contributed significantly to the refinement of TTE's principles and practices. Since 1986, the author has played an active role in introducing alternative therapies into Brazils public healthcare system, a term that referred at the time to what is now known as Traditional, Complementary, and Integrative Medicine - TCIM. She was part of the first implementation group within the social health network, under the former Ministry of Social Welfare (Ministério da Previdência e Assistência Social  MPAS). With the creation of Brazils Unified Health System (Sistema Único de Saúde - SUS) , she later helped to implement acupuntura, homeopatia, phytoterapia, and natural nutrition at the Mental Health Institute of the Federal District, a public mental health day-hospital. These practices were expanded into the broader mental política de saúde of the Federal District Government, serving as a reference for similar initiatives in other Brazilian states. Transessential Therapy is based on three core principles: 1 - Individuals and groups are the agents of their own healing and transformation; 2 - There is no overcoming or healing without self-transformation; 3 - The therapist-individual and therapist-group relationship must be grounded in compassion, generosity, and mutual trust. TTE views both individuals and groups as presenting diverse needs and expressions of suffering. As such, it requires a systemic and contextual assessment that includes all levels of the human essence, forming what is known as the Transessential Spiral. The primary goal of TTE is to enhance clarity regarding the sources of suffering and, based on the imbalances identified, to design a therapeutic sequence tailored to those needs, thereby avoiding fragmented or disjointed care. Each level of that spiral requires a specific form of harmonization or therapeutic approach, with the ultimate aim of restoring overall balance and well-being. With extensive experience in various TCIM methodologies, and to avoid the fragmentation often found in such approaches, the author recognized the need to develop a method capable of integrating the multiple dimensions of human essence: physical-biological, etheric-vibrational, emotional, mental, consciousness-based, and spiritual. She aimed to create a tool to assist in patient or group anamnesis, allowing for an understanding across these dimensions and the identification of any disharmonies, so that an appropriate and individualized therapeutic program could be developed. The initial premise was that, given the diversity of integrative approaches, each with distinct principles and methods of action, the therapist must first understand the clinical and experiential dynamics of the individual or group. Only then can they recommend the most suitable tratamento to address the dysfunctions identified during the assessment. TTE emerged from this essential need to gain deeper insight into those who suffer and to offer a synergistic, systemic approach to healing. Below is a clinical case illustrating the application of TTE. MCA, 33 years old, with a history of psychiatric tratamento for 10 years. Intense suffering with no prospect of improvement despite numerous psychiatric tratamentos. Since adolescence, symptoms of discouragement, chronic fatigue, lack of energy for work and life; periods of sadness, hopelessness, and mood instability, distress, and depressive mood; irritability and impatience. Allergies since childhood, occasional diarrhea, and skin lesions. Relatively functional family, caring parents, and good acadêmico development. In adulthood, difficulty working and chronic fatigue. In the transessential anamnesis, a detailed map of her health was made, targeting all essential fields, which showed symptoms of depressão and a general impairment of the physical body and her emotional state, with a prescription for antidepressants and other guidelines for physical-biological needs in a systemic way. She began physical exercise and dietary guidance (gluten-free and dairy-free diet). During consultations, the patient was always encouraged to understand the importance of the transessential spiral fields as a whole and to adopt a self-aware attitude, including showing scientific evidence (mental field). She participated in a spiritual retreat (spiritual field) and physical healthcare (physical-biological field) that included a natural diet and the replacement of micronutrients necessary to activate her metabolism. She was diagnosed with occult inflammation as the systemic source of the problem, being treated by Healthy Longevity and referred for psychoterapia. After 12 months of tratamento, MCA showed significant improvement in her depressive symptoms and physical complaints, with a willingness to work and return to her normal life. The improvement occurred even with the suspension of antidepressants. MCA says she has gained a lot of enthusiasm for life, recognizing her emotional problems and her commitment to self-transformation (emotional field). She began volunteer work helping women who are victims of abuse, thus investing in the field of consciousness. This example shows that the various fields of the transessential spiral are connected, even though the main complaint indicated a diagnosis of depressão in official medicine, reaffirming that we are an integrated whole. Illness and dysfunction can manifest themselves through any of these fields and in multiple forms. When healthcare professionals are attentive to the whole, they are much more likely to reach the central cause and treat the root of the problem. TTE is also intended to dynamically assess individuals or groups, allowing for the construction of a therapeutic path aligned with the needs of each specific moment or situation. An important secondary function of this approach is to support interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary collaboration. The use of the Transessential Spiral serves as a shared, attuned language among healthcare professionals, enabling the creation of a coherent and collaborative therapeutic team.",

    "abstract": "In medical school, we are taught that for almost every problem, there is a solution  and most of the time, it involves allopathic medication. In pediatrics, it is not uncommon to encounter babies and young children who have already gone through multiple rounds of medication for symptoms that are part of normal physiological development  such as colic, fever, sleep changes, or mild viral infections. The demand for immediate relief, coupled with parental fear and hurried clinical listening, often leads to early intervençãos, without allowing the child's body the opportunity to respond naturally. In integrative pediatrics, we develop a clinical reasoning that goes beyond this fragmented and objective acadêmico view. The professional's role is not only to diagnose and prescribe but to understand the factors involved in the health-disease process, to interpret the body's signals to caregivers, and to restore their confidence in their own caregiving capacity. Active listening, addressing parental concerns, and clear explanations of physiological processes became the foundation of this experience. As a pediatrician, I learned about diseases. As a pediatrician with an integrative approach, I learned about health and about empowering caregivers to make conscious decisions regarding their children. After my training in Integrative Medicine, I set aside prescription pads and pens and began using my voice more. I introduced practices such as therapeutic touch and natural hygiene in infants with colic, clinical observation of fever without the automatic use of antipyretics, and immune support through nutritional measures (dietary guidance and preventive supplementation), along with improving gut health by using substances that enhance barrier integrity and microbiota balance. These practices were implemented in my private clinic, where I have followed a total of 480 patients aged 013 years since March 2024. A significant reduction was observed in emergency room visits (public and private) and in the indiscriminate prescription of antibiotics in this population. There was also a remarkable reduction in hospital admissions due to acute respiratory conditions, with only three cases reported in 2025. The resultados of this approach go beyond therapeutic aspects: they include parental satisfaction from feeling respected and confident, as well as my own professional fulfillment in knowing that I am providing the best possible care, prescribing medication only when truly necessary. Over time, families who once sought quick fixes began to value listening, bonding, and non-invasive care. This personal and professional journey confirmed, in practice, what the principles of Integrative Medicine already emphasize: healing does not come only from external measures, but from strengthening the body as a wholein its physical, emotional, and even spiritual dimensions. The demedicalization of childhood does not mean the absence of care. On the contrary, when medication is necessary, it is used consciously. But this care canand shouldbe deeper, where time, presence, and awareness also become therapeutic tools. Even within the time and infrastructure constraints often imposed by saúde pública systems and private insurance, it is possible to implement integrative strategies safely and effectively. The key is a shift in focus  from the immediacy of symptom suppression to respectful, active listening to the childs body. Instead of silencing with medication, we aim to understand. This experience reinforces the urgency of including integrative practices in medical education, especially in pediatrics. The care of children can no longer be reactive and prescription-based. It must be grounded in education, prevenção, and connection  the true pillars of health.",

    "abstract": "In childhood, the body does not only present symptomsit expresses itself. Each fever, cry, change in sleep or appetite is part of the manifestation of a whole, a small fragment of a complex and profound system. A childs health is not limited to physical aspects; it reflects a set of internal and external experiences, often silent, that cross emotional and even spiritual dimensions. The childs body, in its wisdom, reveals what cannot yet be expressed in words. Frequently, what manifests in the childs organism is intimately connected to the emotional state of those around themespecially the mother. It was Candace Pert who coined the concept of bodymind. The fusion of the words body and mind, written as one, reminds us of the impossibility of separating them in human care. Every emotion generates a physical response; every thought translates into a complex chemistry of neurotransmitters that connect organs and systems. In childhood, the developing brain receives stimuli not only from the childs own body but also from their caregivers. The bodymind expands: illness often becomes not only the childs expression but also a reflection of the relational bonds surrounding them. From my training in integrative pediatrics, my clinical listening transformed. The 15-minute disease-focused consultation learned in medical school was replaced by attentive observation of the family, which no longer fit within a single hour. I began to see beyond the complaint, recognizing that the expressed symptom, however simple it might seem, could reflect something greater: a relational imbalance, invisible exhaustion, or sustained tension within the family environment. I learned to observe not only physical signs, but also the way a caregiver expresses themselves when speaking about the child: the tone of voice, the weariness in the eyes, the pauses that carry more than words. In light of this, I systematically incorporated active listening to the mother as part of the clinical history in my private practice. I created spaces of support, validated maternal feelings, and offered simple practices for emotional self-regulation. I always made it clear that this was a safe place where mothers could express their feelings, uncertainties, and guilt. I also prioritized maternal physical health, with nutritional guidance and supplementation. Care was expanded through multiprofessional collaboration (psychologists, nurses, occupational therapists) to ensure a more comprehensive approach. The tratamento thus came to encompass not only the childnot to treat the mother instead of the child, but to acknowledge that a childs full health cannot exist without the mothers integral health. The resultados of this change were deeply transformative and extended far beyond children presenting fewer clinical symptoms. Mothers who had once felt invisiblereduced to mere companionscame to occupy a legitimate place of voice and listening in the care process. For many of them, my office became a space where they could express their exhaustion, doubts, and the sense of not being able to cope. On several occasions, I mediated delicate dialogues with support networks (fathers, grandparents, caregivers) so they could understand these mothers needs and recognize their role as a fundamental part of child health. From the moment a mother is cared for, validated, and strengthened, the entire system around the child reorganizes itself. The childs body then responds with balance and vitality. Health, therefore, comes to be understood not only as the absence of symptoms, but as the quality of presence within the bonds that sustain childhood. In the practice of integrative medicine, the traditional biomedical model expands. The focus shifts from symptom to system. And this requires time, presence, listening, and humility from the professionalto recognize that care goes far beyond prescription. This experience reinforces my conviction that the bodymind interface must be at the center of pediatric training. Not as a distant theory, but as part of daily practice. The medicine of the future will not only be more technological, it will also be more affective, conscious, and relational.",

    "abstract": "This relato de experiência details an innovative diagnostic methodology developed within a postgraduate specialization program in Integrative Medicine and Health, based in São Paulo, SP. The program is designed for health professionals from various disciplines who seek to overcome the limitations of the reductionist biomedical model. The primary challenge addressed is the fragmentation of care, where each specialist holds only one piece of the patient's story, making a truly integrative and transdisciplinary approach difficult. The practice is implemented in a unique pedagogical context, utilizing the Botanical Garden of São Paulo as a learning environment. Before engaging with a human case, the professionals are trained in phenomenological observation, a Goethean scientific method, using nature as a guide. They practice observing plants with openness and wonder, training their perceptive capacities to see the wholeness and dynamic processes of a living being. This initial immersion in nature serves to quiet the analytical mind and awaken a more intuitive, holistic way of seeing, which is then applied to the human context. The methodology itself is a structured group process. Following an interview with a patient, each professional enters a meditative state and symbolically represents their perception of the patient's state through non-figurative drawings with colors and forms. This artistic piece is then passed to a colleague, who, without any prior information, writes a brief description of the person they \"see\" in the image. This process generates multiple layers of perceptionintuitive, symbolic, and analyticalwhich converge towards a surprisingly coherent transdisciplinary diagnosis. This final synthesis allows the team to understand complex conditions, such as hypertension, not merely as a physiological number but as a manifestation of imbalances across the patient's physical, vital, emotional, and existential dimensions. The resulting diagnosis forms the basis of a truly integrative therapeutic plan, which is shared with the patient, often sparking profound and transformative insights. This practice serves as a powerful tool for building clinical capacity and fostering a culture of deep inter-professional collaboration. The methodology described was developed to address several critical and interconnected problems present in integrative and multidisciplinary health practices: The Fragmentation and Reductionism of Patient Care: The conventional biomedical model tends to break the human being down into disconnected partsorgans, systems, and biochemical data. This reductionist view makes it difficult to perceive the patient as a whole, often leading to tratamentos that address isolated symptoms rather than the person's integrated reality. The Challenge of True Transdisciplinary Integration: Even in multidisciplinary teams, professionals from different areas often work in parallel, lacking a common language or a shared method to synthesize their diverse perspectives. This \"silo effect\" prevents the emergence of a genuinely unified diagnostic and therapeutic plan, limiting the potential of integrative care. The Superficiality of Conventional Diagnostic Tools: Standard diagnostic methods, heavily reliant on verbal anamnesis and objective tests, frequently fail to capture the deeper, non-verbal dimensions of illness. The symbolic, emotional, and existential meanings behind a patient's conditionthe \"why\" beneath the \"what\"are often overlooked, leading to incomplete understanding and tratamento. The Gap in Health Professionals' Training: Conventional medical and health education does not typically train professionals to use their intuition, sensitivity, and holistic perceptive capacities as valid clinical instruments. There is a lack of structured, reproducible methods to develop these skills and apply them ethically and effectively within a team setting. The implementation of this phenomenological methodology within the postgraduate program has yielded several consistent and significant resultados for both the participating professionals and the individuals being assisted: Emergence of a Coherent Diagnostic Consensus: Despite the subjective and artistic nature of the initial step, the collection of symbolic images and written interpretations consistently converges toward a unified and surprisingly coherent diagnostic picture. The team is able to achieve a deep consensus that transcends their individual disciplinary viewpoints. Profound and Holistic Patient Understanding: The process enables the clinical team to move beyond surface-level symptoms and access a multi-dimensional understanding of the patient. A condition like hypertension, for example, is reframed from a mere physiological measurement to a manifestation of interconnected pressures across the patient's emotional, relational, and existential life. This holistic view directly informs the creation of a more precise and comprehensive integrative therapeutic plan. Transformative \"Mirror Effect\" for the Patient: Sharing the synthesized images and descriptions with the individual often produces a powerful catalytic effect. Many report profound moments of self-recognition and transformative insight, as they see their inner, often unarticulated, state reflected back to them in a symbolic and non-judgmental way. Development of Professional Capacities and Collaboration: For the participating health professionals, the practice has proven to be a powerful tool for developing latent clinical skills, such as intuition, holistic perception, and symbolic thinking. Furthermore, the process dismantles traditional hierarchies and fosters a culture of deep listening and genuine inter-professional collaboration. Key challenges include the high demand on time, incompatible with conventional healthcare productivity; the need for specific phenomenological training, limiting its scalability; and the difficulty of validation using traditional scientific metrics. Therefore, we recommend its implementation in protected-time sessions for complex cases; the inclusion of perceptual skills in health education curricula; and the development of qualitativo research to formally investigate its resultados.",

    "abstract": "The seminar Knowledge: Integrative and Complementary Practices in Health, organised by SESC SP, proved to be an effective model for training health professionals. The richness of the meeting, which brought together masters of ancestral knowledge and acadêmicos for a dialogue on TCIM, shows how organisational choices enhance the transformative nature of non-formal education. The seminar proved relevant to health education, addressing topics such as prevenção, medicinal plants and the valorisation of different knowledge systems, in line with the Inspira 2025 Project, carried out in 34 Sesc São Paulo units. The Social Service of Commerce, known as Sesc, operates as a private institution and has a network of more than 40 operational centres distributed throughout the state of São Paulo. Maintained by entrepreneurs in the goods, tourism and services sectors, its objective is to promote the well-being and qualidade de vida of its employees and their families. Among its programmatic and non-formal education activities, Sesc São Paulo carries out Inspira  Actions for a Healthy Life, dedicated to stimulating reflection on health and qualidade de vida. In 2025, the eighth edition of the event took place in 34 Sesc São Paulo units and focused on the theme of health culture, choosing Traditional, Complementary and Integrative Medicine -TCIM as its main focus. On April 8 and 9, 2025, Sesc Vila Mariana became the meeting point for the Seminar \"Knowledge: Integrative and Complementary Health Practices\", an event that forms part of the schedule for the 8th edition of Sesc São Paulo's \"Inspira - Actions for Healthy Living\". The seminar was based on the knowledge that has historically shaped health culture in Brazil, valuing the ancestry present in indigenous traditions, African practices and regional knowledge. These elements were incorporated as fundamental pillars for building a broader and more plural understanding of healthcare. The seminar highlighted the importance of strengthening knowledge and appreciation of Traditional, Complementary and Integrative Medicine -TCIM among health professionals. At the same time, it set out to break away from the traditional lecture format, promoting spaces for listening and genuine exchanges between different forms of knowledge - ancestral, popular and scientific. The proposal went beyond the simple transmission of content: it sought to build a training experience capable of integrating diverse views on healthcare, broadening the cultural sensitivity and effective action of the participants. The process of organising this event as a whole was supported by the Health and Dentistry Management team of our institution's administration, the São Paulo Health Secretariat, and partnerships with private and saúde pública services, universities, and researchers to publicise the activities. Attracting the public focused on prioritising the participation of health professionals, who can disseminate and use this knowledge in their professional practices, but invitations were also extended to students of permanent SESC courses, such as yoga and circle dance, for example, in addition to the spontaneous public interested in the topics. Invitations were sent to health service managers and widely publicised on the institution's social media. We emphasise that all activities were funded by our institution and offered free of charge to all interested parties. The activities related to the seminar included lectures, roundtable discussions, and physical practice classes that took place before or after the two-day seminar. The complete programme consisted of meditação experiences with 132 participants in four sessions, five sessions of mantra yoga classes with 556 participants, biodanza classes with 173 individuals, workshops on the use of medicinal plants in childhood and ageing with 53 individuals, a roundtable discussion on humanisation in birth and indigenous knowledge with 30 people, and lectures on the following topics during the two-day seminar: Reflections on lines of care in Traditional, Complementary and Integrative Medicine, a master class on the association of popular knowledge and the role of universities in disseminação knowledge, on traditional indigenous medicine, the use of medicinal herbs and popular culture, and knowledge of terreiros with African roots, which attracted a total of over 359 participants. The seminar and its integrated actions provided a valuable exchange of knowledge and experiences, materializing a dynamic and enriching learning space to deepen understanding of various PICS and their applicability. The dialogical format and guest curatorship proved effective in engaging the public and stimulating critical reflection, resulting in a high potential impact on the training of health professionals. The initiative in question focused on exploring a diverse range of care, going beyond strictly conventional approaches. Ancestral knowledge was valued, such as indigenous medicine and African traditions, as well as interaction with the ecosystem and the healing potential of plants. The primary objective was to demonstrate how these practices can be integrated into the current health system, promoting a comprehensive care perspective, expanding the therapeutic arsenal and strengthening each person's ability to manage their own health and well-being. Coordination between educational institutions, health services and cultural organizations is an essential pillar for ensuring the success and continuity of initiatives like this. We encourage the reproduction of events such as the \"Knowledge Seminar\" as a tool for continuing education in Traditional, Complementary and Integrative Medicine -TCIM, whenever possible combining relevant content with participatory methodologies. The value of planning centered on the participant's experience is also highlighted, favoring the exchange of knowledge and dialogue between different cultures. Finally, discussions in all practical and theoretical activities reinforced the need to understand and value traditional knowledge, which is often underestimated and devalued, and the importance of debating these forms of care within research centres and health services, and bringing indigenous peoples, communities and other holders of this knowledge to the forefront of this movement.",

    "abstract": "The \"Self-Care and Integral Health\" course is an initiative of the CUIDAR Extension Project of the Universidade Federal de São Paulo - UNIFESP, School of Medicine, designed to empower individuals to take an active role in managing their own health and well-being. The proposal goes beyond the traditional concept of self-care, exploring a holistic and multidimensional view of health, especially designed for healthcare practitioners. The course covers baseado em evidence health practices, providing participants with solid knowledge for making conscious choices. A central pillar is the exploration of the Self-Care Canvas, a practical and innovative tool that guides participants through a structured process of self-knowledge and action. This Canvas involves 4 stages: 1) Finding needs, 2) Embracing emotions and sensations, 3) Moving towards healthy habits, and 4) beginning Again after challenges. The \"Self-Care and Integral Health\" course's objectives include: Promoting awareness about the importance of self-care in daily life. Providing practical tools and strategies for participants to incorporate self-care into their routines. Encouraging the pursuit of integral health, encompassing physical, mental, emotional, and social aspects. The 10-virtual class course is a transformative learning experience. It equips participants with the knowledge and tools needed to cultivate a more balanced and healthy life by addressing common challenges and empowering them with autonomy and a proactive role in their own self-care journey. It explores concepts of health, care, and disease, evidence and research concerning TCIM, self-knowledge and meditação practices. There has been three editions of the Self-care and Integral health course (2021, 2022 and 2023). Overall we received 750 inscriptions and the classes were offered through the Google Classroom in the second semester of each year. Regarding the Self-Care Canvas, we collected and analyzed 108 responses between October 2022 and December 2024. The respondents' average age was 40, ranging from 18 to 65 years old. Our analysis allowed us to group responses for each stage of the FEMA Method: 1) Find, 2) Embrace, 3) Move, and 4) Again. Heres a breakdown of the grouped responses: In the Find stage, guiding questions for filling out the Canvas include: \"Which feelings, emotions, or illnesses do I want to address\", \"Which professionals, models, and health practices can help me\", and \"Which processes or strategies don't seem to work\" Consequently, the most frequently addressed themes were related to mental health, with a strong emphasis on ansiedade, terapia, meditação, and the search for professionals and practices to manage emotions and feelings. Following, the \"Embrace\" stage guides participants to delve deeper into their experiences. The key questions for filling out the Canvas at this point are: \"What are the meanings of this situation in my life\", \"What are the limitations of this situation\", and \"What are the opportunities within this situation\" From the responses, we systematically categorized the mentioned limitations and opportunities into thematic groups for clearer visualization and understanding. The responses related to the Limitations Group were as follows: Emotional Desafios, Time and Energy Management, Mental and Physical Health, Professional and Personal Limitations, Relationship Desafios, Financial and Professional Desafios, Health and Well-being Desafios and Self-Care Desafios. Among the opportunities identified by participants in this stage, the following themes emerged: Personal Growth, Routine Improvement Self-knowledge and Health, Achievement and Duty Fulfilled, Relationships and Communication, Professional Opportunities, Motivation and Well-being, Self-care and Acceptance. The third stage of the Self-Care Canvas, \"Move,\" guides participants toward actionable change. The key questions for this section include: \"What changes can help me reach my goal\", \"What are the possible solutions for the identified situations\", and \"How can I measure the impact of the changes I should implement\" From the responses, we were able to group the objectives for change, possible solutions, and the anticipated impacts of these changes. Here are some illustrative examples: 1. Personal Improvement and Health Objectives: Getting life back on track, returning to studies, improving diet quality. Solutions: Engaging in self-care practices and health intervençãos such as meditação, physical activity, terapia, and healthy eating. Impacts: Enhanced well-being and self-awareness, including observing mood, energy levels, feelings of reward, and a decrease in ansiedade. 2. Emotional and Relational Development Objectives: Accepting changes, reducing self-criticism, improving relationships. Solutions: Practicing emotional development and open communication through self-control, self-knowledge, and direct communication. Impacts: Greater emotional and relational growth, including deeper self-knowledge, recognizing accomplishments, and fostering better relationships. 3. Mental and Physical Health Objectives: Reducing workload, prioritizing mental and physical well-being. Solutions: Achieving a better work-life balance by incorporating more rest, intentional self-care for mind and body, and adopting a \"slow-down\" approach to life. Impacts: Greater overall balance and improved mental health, observable through changes in energy levels, sleep quality, and emotional state. Finally in the last stage, \"Again\", the results reveal that achieving self-care goals is associated with a range of improvements in physical and mental well-being, such as quality sleep, increased energy, emotional balance (patience, serenity, reduced ansiedade), improved physical health (including hormonal regulation), greater confidence, and enjoyment from hobbies and accomplishments. Conversely, signs of a \"new cycle restart\" or imbalance include negative feelings like unhappiness, impatience, frustration, excessive fatigue, irritation, lack of motivation, and the recurrence of mental or physical health issues, indicating the need to re-evaluate and adjust self-care strategies. The \"Self-Care and Integral Health\" course offers a transformative learning experience, equipping participants with the knowledge and tools needed to cultivate a more balanced and healthy life by emphasizing autonomy and a proactive role in their own well-being. Healthcare professionals should be encouraged to apply and improve Self-care strategies as the Self-care Canvas regularly, not just during periods of training. Consistent engagement fosters self-awareness, helping them proactively identify needs and adjust strategies before burnout sets in. This cultivates a habit of mindful self-assessment. While deeply personal, the Canvas can be highly effective in group settings and can be proposed to patients, broadening the assistance. Facilitated workshops can provide a safe space for healthcare professionals to share insights, discuss challenges, and learn from peers. This collaborative environment reinforces that self-care is a shared responsibility and builds a supportive community, reducing feelings of isolation.",

    "abstract": "The Inspira Project has been run by SESC São Paulo (Social Service of Commerce) since 2018, and its aim is to spread knowledge and a culture of health, in order to encourage people to create healthy habits, seek a better qualidade de vida, provide guidance on health concepts; which are not restricted to clinical practices and bring reflections on scientific and popular health knowledge. In 2025, the guiding theme of the actions was Integrative and Complementary Health Practices (ICPHPs), and before the project's activities began in 34 different units in the state of São Paulo, the Seminar  Saberes was held, which brought important dialogues about ancestral practices, traditional integration with conventional tratamentos and reflections on various therapeutic forms recognized by the World Health Organization (WHO), with a focus on primarily reaching health professionals from different services and the institution's health programmers. Sesc is recognized for its wide-ranging service of promoting socio-educational activities related to the well-being and qualidade de vida of commercial workers and their families, as well as expanding these activities to the general population. For some years now, the institution has taken a cross-cutting approach to Pics in its occasional and permanent actions, with an emphasis on various body practices such as yoga, circular dance and oriental Chinese practices, but it also offers courses on medicinal plants, indigenous and African matrix knowledge, as well as baseado em evidence scientific knowledge, in the form of lectures, workshops and conversation circles, for example. These activities are aimed at visitors to the units and sometimes a specific audience profile is also sought. The Seminar was planned based on logistical support and partnerships between public and private health institutions, universities and SESC, also with the institutional support of BIREME-OPAS. The Vila Mariana Unit team created a strategy of dialog between these partners to define the formats of the actions, the target audience, and the best strategy for broad participation by health professionals, students and SESC professionals. After organizing the flow of vacancies and active search, we had the effective participation of large Social Organizations (OS's) operating in the public and private sectors in the city of São Paulo, hospital networks affiliated to the Sindicato das Santas Casas de Misericórdia and philanthropic hospitals in the state of São Paulo, students from public universities, as well as the institution's employees and the population interested in the topics. The Seminar and all the training, practices and actions related to the project were offered free of charge, expanding the possibility of participants and access for individuals from different socio-economic classe , with the entire investment paid for by Sesc SP. In particular, the event highlighted traditional knowledge linked to indigenous medicine, the use of medicinal plants and practices of African origin, presented by masters of knowledge and important researchers of PICs in Brazil. Reflections were also promoted on mapping these practices in saúde pública services, the interface between traditional knowledge and its teaching in universities, and the construction of a virtual library of traditional medicine covering five continents. Over the course of three weeks, the public was also able to take part in workshops, open classes and lectures related to these themes. We had 501 people register for the seminar and 147 people for the other activities offered at the Vila Mariana unit. The seminar was effectively attended by 364 people over the two days of activities. Of these participants, we counted 69 Sesc São Paulo professionals, from 25 of the institution's units, the vast majority being in the city of São Paulo, but reaching a total of 12 cities with operational units. In our registration search, we identified 97 professionals working directly in services related to Social Organizations (OS) and public sectors, and these professionals work in 7 different cities, covering hospitals, outpatient clinics, specialty centers, atenção primária and regional health coordinators. The number of professionals working in the eastern and southern regions of the city of São Paulo stands out, working in 41 different health establishments, but data was observed from participants working in all regions of the city, including the expanded center, and the western and northern regions. In our statistical system, we observed that the online registrants, who represent 326 individuals, are 82% women and 91% of the participants are workers accredited to our institution, 100% of whom have a university degree. This data reflects the importance of attracting this audience for educational actions and maintaining this relationship that provides professionals with the opportunity to learn and exchange knowledge at no cost and in a democratic way. The large turnout of professionals shows that we have achieved our goal of broadening knowledge about PICs. Throughout the days of the event, we reinforced our commitment to providing up-to-date, quality information that directly affects those who work with and take this knowledge to different services and communities. Although PICs are widely discussed in health services, at Sesc and some research and teaching institutions, we emphasize that it is of the utmost importance to train more and more people, in order to democratize the applicability of PICs to the entire population. Giving access to knowledge also reinforces the importance of our institutional values related to the breadth of culture and knowledge for all.",

    "abstract": "Molluscum contagiosum is a common viral infection in childhood, caused by the poxvirus, which leads to the appearance of small, round, umbilicated papules. Although self-limiting, the condition may persist for several months and spread through direct contact, causing aesthetic discomfort, itching, and risk of secondary bacterial infections. Despite the possibility of spontaneous regression, tratamento is essential due to the social and psychological impact caused by the widespread presence of lesions in children. Conventional therapeutic options, such as curettage, cryoterapia, and topical application of 10% potassium hydroxide, have limitations regarding tolerability and adherence, especially in young children (Can et al., 2004). The protocol adopted in this case was inspired by the clinical study conducted by Markum & Baillie (2012), which evaluated the efetividade of combining Melaleuca alternifolia essential oil and iodine in the tratamento of molluscum contagiosum in children. Adapting this proposal to complementary clinical practice, we also chose to associate the use of therapeutic crystalline silicon patches, applied directly to the lesion, with the aim of facilitating the partial mechanical extraction of the papular content. This combined approach aimed to promote lesion regression in a safe, non-invasive, and more tolerable way for the child. In line with the theme Complementary and Integrative Practices Across the Lifespan, this relato de experiência aims to describe the use of Melaleuca alternifolia essential oil, in association with iodine solution and silicon patch application, as an integrative approach to the tratamento of molluscum contagiosum in a school-aged child. The patient, a female child aged 8, presented with approximately 40 molluscum contagiosum lesions, mainly distributed on the abdomen, elbows, and inner thighs. Some papules were inflamed, especially in the area of friction between the thighs, showing signs of erythema and mild pain on palpation. The lesions had a typical morphologyumbilicated papules with a pinkish or whitish appearanceand had been progressively spreading over the previous weeks. It was evident during clinical evaluation that lesion proliferation was occurring through direct contact between body areas, such as the repeated contact of the elbows with the inner thighs, suggesting viral autoinoculation facilitated by constant itching and friction. The patient had a prior diagnosis of atopic dermatitis, a condition that compromises the integrity of the skin barrier and is associated with increased susceptibility to viral skin infections, including more extensive and persistent forms of molluscum contagiosum (Silverberg, 2003; Nascimento et al., 2011). The main complaint from the caregivers was the aesthetic discomfort and persistent itching, which interfered with the childs routine, causing embarrassment in school environments and difficulty participating in physical activities with other children. Despite some inflamed lesions, no clinical signs of secondary bacterial infection were observed. The aromatherapeutic protocol was developed based on the childs age and clinical condition. Initially, topical application of an iodine solution was performed, followed by direct application of pure Melaleuca alternifolia (tea tree) essential oil, restricted to the skin lesions, twice a day. From the fourth day on, with clinical observation that some papules showed signs of imminent rupture, therapeutic crystalline silicon patches were introducedtools commonly used in integrative practices such as needle-free acupuntura. The patches were applied to the most prominent lesions, aiming to promote mechanical drainage of their contents in a non-invasive manner. After 24 hours, the patches were removed, and the topical protocol was reapplied, initiating a new cycle of observation and care. This protocol was based on the randomized ensaio clínico by Markum & Baillie (2012), in which 53 children received topical tratamento twice daily with a combination of Melaleuca oil and iodine (TTO-I). After 30 days, 16 out of 19 children (84%) in the TTO-I group showed more than 90% reduction in lesion count, compared to only 3 out of 18 (17%) in the Melaleuca-only group and 1 out of 16 (6%) in the iodine-only group. Furthermore, Melaleuca alternifolia essential oil contains terpinen4ol, its main bioactive compound, which has demonstrated antiviral, antibacterial, antifungal, and anti-inflammatory properties. In vitro studies indicate that it may disrupt viral membranes and suppress inflammatory mediators such as TNF, IL1, IL8, and PGE, supporting its clinical use in skin infections (Hammer et al., 2006). The child showed good adherence to the protocol, and no cutaneous or systemic adverse reactions were observed during follow-up. By the end of two weeks, a significant reduction in the number of active lesions was observed, with complete elimination of the lesions and no appearance of new affected areas. The combined protocol proved to be safe, well-tolerated, and potentially effective as a complementary approach to the management of molluscum contagiosum in children. No efeitos adversos were observed with the topical use of undiluted tea tree oil on intact skin, in small amounts and limited to the lesion area. The patient was closely monitored throughout the process, and given her age, the decision to use the essential oil in its pure form was clinically justified. This suggests good segurança when applied with professional judgment in pediatric populations. This report reinforces the potential of clinical aromaterapia as a complementary integrative practice in the management of self-limiting viral dermatoses in children. The combination of gentle and well-tolerated approaches can provide comfort, reduce the duration of lesion progression, and improve the experience of the child and family when facing a prolonged dermatological condition. Such integrative strategies may be particularly useful when conventional tratamentos are not feasible or accepted, reinforcing the need for interdisciplinary collaboration in pediatric dermatological care. However, relato de casos do not allow for generalizations, and there is a clear need for controlled clinical studies with larger samples to evaluate the efetividade and segurança of essential oil intervençãos in pediatric populations. The lack of validated tools for the objective measurement of symptoms such as itching, discomfort, or psychosocial impact remains a challenge in aromaterapia research. The incorporation of more standardized clinical protocols, such as the TREATS checklist proposed by the Aromatic Research Quality Appraisal Taskforce (ARQAT), may contribute to greater methodological transparency and scientific rigor in future studies.",

    "abstract": "I filed a judicial review to the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Indonesia, regarding article 1 of the Health Law - which defines medical personnel and health personnel as having to be college graduates, because this definition is considered detrimental to traditional practitioners. The trial process has been going on from July 2024 to January 2025. Starting from the preliminary hearing, to hear the advice of the panel of judges. Then continued with the trial to hear the government's response, represented by the general secretary of the ministry of health. Hearing the parliament's response, represented by the head of the health commission. As well as hearing the statements of witnesses from the government. The trial was conducted openly to the public and broadcast live. I presented evidence, some of which was only allowed to be seen by the panel of judges, because ethically - the identity and images of the client's genitals must be kept private. According to Indonesian law, invasive procedures may only be performed by medical / health personnel, and only college graduates can be recognized as medical / health personnel. In short, other than college graduates are prohibited from performing invasive procedures. Circumcision is the removal of prepuce by circular incision. Sunat is the removal of the kulup (prepuce / preputium) with or without circumcision. An example of sunat without circumcision is bogem or lipet, where the skin is folded back. Another example of sunat without circumcision is gusaran, where the prepuce is only scratched. Circumcision is performed on males, while sunat is performed on both males or females. Circumcision was popularized to modern medicine by Dr. Jonathan Hutchinson, while sunat has been carried out since ancient times. Circumcision is performed for health reasons, while sunat is performed for reasons of tradition and belief. Circumcision (based on medical diagnosis) is covered by the Indonesian health insurance program, while sunat (for traditional purposes) is not covered. Translating sunat as circumcision, only textually, has negative impacts on natives. In addition to invasive practices, much traditional knowledge was banned to extinction, because it was considered unscientific at the time. An example is hypnosis, known in Indonesia as gendam. The Court accepted my legal standing, so that in jurisprudence I became the first sunat expert in Indonesia. The Court rejected all requests and decided to maintain the law. However, in the a quo decision, the Court emphasized to the Government in casu the Ministry of Health, not to prohibit the practice of sunat experts and to provide free education at the tertiary level, so that natives and their knowledge can be included in the national health system. Parliament admitted that they had overlooked sunat experts when discussing the health bill. They promised that no one would lose their jobs, by encouraging the health minister to make implementing regulations that accommodate natives [Minutes of the Court - Session VI no 92] 4 . The decision of the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Indonesia, verdict and ratio decidendi, is final and binding, and is valid from the moment it is pronounced. However, until now, the Ministry of Health remains adamant that sunat (textually translated as circumcision) may only be performed by doctors, and does not provide education as mandated by the Constitutional Court, and reject the proposed circumciser competency standards. The decision of the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Indonesia is a reverse approach taken for the sake of justice. Usually integrative medicine is initiated by acadêmicos, who acquire native knowledge for free. Now, acadêmicos are required to share what they have, to natives for free. This decision can be imitated to overcome the latent conflict between acadêmicos and natives",

    "abstract": "This relato de experiência outlines observations and insights gathered during a global health practicum conducted in La Paz, Bolivia, focusing on the integration of Traditional Bolivian Medicine into the national healthcare system. La Paz, situated at an altitude of approximately 3,650 meters (11,975 feet), is Bolivia's administrative capital and a dynamic urban center characterized by rich cultural diversity, significant indigenous populations, and distinct socioeconomic divisions. The city serves as an essential location for observing the interactions and integration processes between traditional, complementary, and conventional biomedical practices. During the practicum, information was systematically gathered through direct observations in various healthcare settings, including both private and public clinics and hospitals across La Paz. Observational sites included Hospital de Clínicas (public), Clinica Alemana (private), and smaller community-based clinics, enabling a comprehensive understanding of healthcare delivery across different organizational frameworks. Additionally, structured conversations and informal dialogues were held with diverse healthcare providers, including conventional medical doctors, natural medicine practitioners, and traditional indigenous healers. These interactions aimed to understand the nuances of collaborative practice, barriers to integration, patient perceptions, and institutional support for traditional and integrative medicine practices within Bolivias pluralistic healthcare landscape. Several interrelated challenges emerged throughout the practicum regarding the implementation of policies and practices aimed at integrating traditional Bolivian medicine into the national healthcare system. Although Bolivia's Universal Health System (SUS) legally supports the inclusion of traditional and natural medicine, the practical implementation of these laws remains inconsistent. Many traditional healers and natural medicines are not covered by SUS, making them inaccessible through formal healthcare channels and often limiting their use to out-of-pocket or community-based contexts. In many families, particularly those from indigenous or lower socioeconomic backgrounds, traditional remedies are often the first line of careused at home or accessed through local healersbefore seeking tratamento at hospitals or clinics. This pattern reflects cultural preferences, economic considerations, and sometimes distrust or perceived inaccessibility of the formal medical system. Despite growing recognition of the importance of traditional medicine for increasing healthcare access and fostering cultural responsiveness, there remains a lack of clear regulation regarding the training, credentialing, and oversight of traditional healers and naturopathic doctors. This regulatory ambiguity complicates efforts to formally integrate these practitioners into the conventional system, hindering interprofessional collaboration and raising questions about quality assurance and patient segurança. The disconnect between policy and practice, compounded by limited institutional support and fragmented referral systems, highlights the need for more robust implementation strategies, greater resource allocation, and deeper engagement with local communities and traditional practitioners. Without addressing these systemic barriers, the potential benefits of a truly integrative healthcare model remain difficult to realize in Bolivia's evolving health landscape.",

    "abstract": "This experience was implemented in Ghana and The Gambia, two West African countries with distinct yet complementary landscapes ideal for advancing Traditional, Complementary, and Integrative Medicine (TCIM), particularly naturopathy. Ghana, a regional leader in health and education policy, has a structured technical and vocational education system under the Commission for TVET. However, prior to this initiative, there were no accredited naturopathy training pathways or occupational standards. Most practitioners operated informally, and traditional medicine stakeholders expressed skepticism toward naturopathy. To address this, I led the development of Ghanas first National Occupational Standards and Competency-Based Training (CBT) curricula for naturopathy, ranging from National Proficiency to BTech levels. These intervençãos formally embedded naturopathy into the national education system, aligning it with global standards while respecting African healing values. In The Gambia, traditional medicine is culturally embedded but lacked legal or educational structures. As Legal Director of the Traditional Healers Association (TRAHASS), I supported the integration of healers into the health system through clinical training partnerships with Ahmadiyya Muslim Hospital and policy engagement with the Ministry of Health. This work contributed to drafting The Gambias first TCIM Bill, aiming to provide legal recognition and regulatory frameworks for practitioners. To ease tensions between traditional healers and naturopaths in Ghana, a two-tier licensing model was introduced: Registered Naturopaths (RNP) and Doctors of Naturopathy (ND/Dr(Nat)). Additionally, the Naturo-Herbal model, blending naturopathy with African herbalism, was adopted to promote unity and curriculum integration. Both countries face rising chronic diseases and strained biomedical systems. This project responds by formalizing TCIM through education, legal reform, and cultural innovationoffering a scalable model for African health sovereignty and sustainable development. Despite the widespread use of Traditional, Complementary, and Integrative Medicine (TCIM) across Africa, particularly naturopathy, there remains a significant gap in its formal recognition, regulation, and integration into national education and health systems. Naturopathy has often been misunderstood, marginalized, or lumped together with unregulated traditional practices, leading to confusion, professional conflict, and lack of trust among regulators, medical professionals, and the public. In Ghana, the absence of accredited training pathways, clear licensure categories, and legal definitions created a situation where practitioners operated without formal recognition, often facing professional isolation. Similarly, in The Gambia, although traditional medicine is widely practiced and accepted by the public, there was no legal framework to support its practitioners or define their roles within the broader healthcare system. This regulatory vacuum resulted in missed opportunities for integration, clinical collaboration, and patient segurança. Furthermore, regulatory authorities lacked the technical expertise to evaluate naturopathic or TCIM curricula, and many accreditation bodies operated under biomedical biases that discounted indigenous knowledge systems. In addition, there was growing tension between traditional medicine practitioners and emerging naturopaths, particularly in Ghana, where the introduction of naturopathy was perceived as a threat to long-standing traditional healing systems. Without standardized training, licensure systems, legal backing, and mutual recognition among practitioners, the field of naturopathy in Africa risked fragmentation, exclusion from national health strategies, and the erosion of indigenous healing knowledge. This report addresses these challenges by presenting a comprehensive strategy for legitimizing naturopathy through competency-based education, inclusive legal reform, and culturally responsive innovation, such as the introduction of the Naturo-Herbal model. Outcomes and Achievements  Educational Reform in Ghana: CBT-aligned naturopathy qualifications from NP to BTech are now formally recognized under CTVET.  Policy Milestones in The Gambia: The TCIM bill is under development, and traditional healers now have access to clinical training.  Institutional Partnerships: Collaborations between hospitals and traditional healers have been piloted successfully.  Professional Harmony: The Naturo-Herbal model has improved cooperation and reduced resistance between naturopaths and herbalists. Recomendações Based on practical experiences in Ghana and The Gambia, the following recommendations are proposed to support the effective institutionalization of Traditional, Complementary, and Integrative Medicine (TCIM), particularly naturopathy, across Africa and other LMICs: Develop National TCIM Policies and Legislation: Governments should prioritize the formulation of national TCIM policies and legal frameworks that recognize diverse practitioner categories, protect indigenous healing systems, and ensure professional accountability through regulation. Integrate TCIM into National TVET Systems: Ministries of Health, Education, and TVET authorities should collaborate to embed TCIM disciplines like naturopathy into technical and vocational systems through standardized, competency-based curricula aligned with global benchmarks but rooted in African traditions. Establish Inclusive Licensing Frameworks: Countries should adopt two-tier licensing systems that differentiate between traditional healers with indigenous training and formally educated naturopaths (e.g., Registered Naturopath and Doctor of Naturopathy). This promotes equity, inclusion, and professional respect. Create a Separate Accreditation Framework for TCIM Education: To address the limitations of biomedical-centric accreditation agencies, a dedicated TCIM accreditation body or unit should be established within national or regional quality assurance systems. This framework must be staffed with TCIM experts and recognize indigenous epistemologies, practical competencies, and culturally relevant pedagogies. Promote Regional Harmonization of Standards: Continental and regional bodies (e.g., African Union, ECOWAS) should support the creation of a Pan-African TCIM Curriculum Validation Council to facilitate mutual recognition of TCIM qualifications, practitioner mobility, and cross-border program alignment. Support Capacity Building for Regulators: Governments should fund the training of accreditation boards, policy officers, and regulatory bodies to assess TCIM programs, understand traditional knowledge systems, and evaluate integrative curricula objectively. Facilitate SouthSouth Knowledge Exchange: Successful models such as Ghanas CBT-based framework and The Gambias clinical integration of traditional healers should be documented and adapted across the Global South through regional exchange platforms. Mobilize Public and Donor Funding for TCIM Development: Establish national and donor-supported funding mechanisms to develop TCIM institutions, public awareness campaigns, practitioner development, and research in naturopathy and indigenous healing.",

    "abstract": "The Commission for Integrative and Complementary Practices (CPIC) of the Municipal Health Department of Florianópolis (SMS), established by Ordinance GAB/SMS No. 047 of 2010 and made permanent by Normative Instruction 004/2010, promotes and supports Integrative and Complementary Health Practices (PICS) within the saúde pública system through introductory courses offered to health workers and residents. Each year, a curricular internship in PICS is offered to four health residency programs: the Multidisciplinary Residency in Family Health, the Family and Community Medicine Residency, the Uniprofessional Nursing Residency in Primary Health Care (both from the SMS Public Health School), and the Multidisciplinary Residency in Family Health from the Federal University of Santa Catarina (UFSC). Approximately 120 residentsincluding physicians, nurses, physical education professionals, nutritionists, dentists, pharmacists, physical therapists, psychologists, and social workerscomplete this mandatory internship as part of their training curriculum. With a 50-hour workload, the internship is conducted in partnership with UFSC, the Agricultural Research and Rural Extension Company of Santa Catarina (EPAGRI), and the Environmental Secretariat. A diverse group of professionals with specific expertise, including coordinators from the four residency programs and CPIC members, participate in delivering the internship, mobilizing around 30 instructors with a shared commitment to making the internship a unique and transformative health education experience. The internship aims to provide a broadened and interdisciplinary education for health professionals, encourage critical reflection on medical rationalities in PICS, and promote a comprehensive understanding of the health-disease process. Residents have the opportunity to experience a variety of practices while also gaining essential theoretical knowledge to support such care. The program seeks to equip participants with the tools for the safe and effective use of medicinal and herbal plants, including pharmacological, botanical, ecological, and agronomic aspects, with an emphasis on species most commonly used by the local population. It also aims to promote the cultivation and use of Unconventional Food Plants (PANCs) as a strategy for food and nutritional security, encouraging sustainable practices in home, community, and institutional gardens. The training fosters the development of intersectoral projects, the strengthening of collaborative networks, and an understanding of the socio-environmental determinants of health, aligning with the principles of planetary health. Additional topics include solid waste management, mitigation of climate change impacts, and encouragement of scientific research to develop innovative and sustainable alternatives within Brazils Unified Health System (SUS). In 2025, the internship was restructured into two blocks: Block 1  Integrative and Complementary Practices (PICS) Block 2  Urban Agriculture and Planetary Health The first block included both theoretical and practical sessions, with hands-on experiences in practices such as Meditation, Body Practices, Circle Dance, Lian Gong, Qi Gong, Integrative Community Therapy, Aromaterapia, Extraction Methods, Auriculoterapia, Introduction to Medicinal Cannabis, and Introduction to Herbal Medicinefeaturing medicinal plants and herbal remedies with a focus on those most commonly used by the Florianópolis population. In the second block, residents explored the therapeutic potential of activities like park walks, gardening, and working in greenhouses and cultivation spaces. They learned plant propagation techniques, bed management, and methods of syntropic agriculture, and participated in workshops on PANC-based cooking and composting of organic waste. This internship approach emphasizes collaboration across institutional networks, aiming for synergy through coordinated actions within saúde pública education policies. The internship serves as a training strategy to address the lack of content on PICS, Planetary Health, and Urban Agriculture in the education of Family Health professionals, as well as the limited availability of these practices within SUS services, which restricts public access to such therapeutic approaches. At the end of the 2025 internship, residents received evaluation forms for both blocks. The forms included questions on self-assessment, structure and organization, relevance of topics, and performance of the instructors, with response options being Excellent, Satisfactory, Fair, Poor, or Not Applicable, as well as space for comments, criticism, and suggestions. For the PICS block, 48 responses were received. Of those: 85.5% rated the overall internship experience as Excellent or Satisfactory; 84.95% rated the topic relevance as Excellent or Satisfactory; 84.26% rated instructor performance as Excellent or Satisfactory. For the Urban Agriculture and Planetary Health block, 31 responses were received, with: 100% rating the overall experience as Excellent or Satisfactory; 96.37% rating the topic relevance as Excellent or Satisfactory; 99.19% rating instructor performance as Excellent or Satisfactory. Implementing the internship presented several challenges that required ongoing adaptation by the organizing team and the residents. One key issue was the availability of suitable rooms, as institutional scheduling and infrastructure did not always meet the specific requirements of proposed activitiesparticularly for movement-based practices like bodywork and circle dancing. Another challenge was securing the release of instructors from their daily duties, especially given workforce shortages and the limited number of professionals within the municipal network trained in PICS, Urban Agriculture, and Planetary Health. This was further complicated by financial constraints, which limited the ability to compensate external specialists and to purchase materials or expand practical experiencesnecessitating creativity and resourcefulness. Additionally, incorporating content from non-hegemonic health rationalities proved difficult for residents with little practical exposure or whose professional education was predominantly grounded in biomedical paradigms. This led to questions about scientific legitimacy, often influenced by stigma and bias against alternative medical frameworks.",

    "abstract": "Rolê Agroecológico is grounded in laws promoting organic food in public schools (BRAZIL, 2009; SÃO PAULO, 2015), which set a national minimum of 30% for these purchases  raised to 100% in São Paulo city by 2026. Through this program, the City Hall advances planetary health by aligning sustainable school food procurement with educational processes. It highlights the centrality of food systems (DECLARATION, 2021), institutionalizing a Food and Nutrition Education (FNE) curriculum in elementary education (SÃO PAULO, 2024) and aligning it with the lens of planetary health, given their complementarity (CARVALHO et al., 2024; LAHAM et al., 2024). The 2024 objectives, in the programs first year, focused on participant engagement: 1) 50 farmers and 2) 332 schools, aiming to involve up to 50,000 students. Launched via Public Notice No. 01/SME/CODAE/2023, the program promotes educational visits for 1112-year-old students to gardens and parks in urban and rural areas of the city, offering meals and food kits with local produce. The civil society organization CREN  Center for Recovery and Nutrition Education  is responsible for technical assistance: nutrition and farmer support, and educational assistance for teachers. These services are considered engagement strategies and were developed and implemented by CREN. For farmers, a course on good food handling practices was offered, supporting the preparation of food kits and meals. For educators, an eBook was presented on how to pedagogically engage with the experience. As an evaluation method, the program prioritized internal process documentation via control forms, enabling the consolidation of implementation data for both schools and farmers. All participants were asked to consent to data sharing before engaging in activities. Specific challenges for engagement included: 1) short time frame for training before the first student visits; 2) unforeseen issues such as weather, parental authorization, and internal motivation, which led to the cancellation of some visits. Broader challenges included implementing the program during a municipal election year, which brought legal restrictions on institutional communication and hindered communication with schools and stakeholders. Interdepartmental governance also faced difficulties in fully achieving intersectoral collaboration among different municipal secretariats. In 2024, the program engaged: 1) 69 farmers, producing 15,569 meals and 18,211 agroecological food kits, all in line with food supply parameters; 2) 22,221 students from 325 schools, involving up to 1,495 educators. These results indicate strong adherence to the goals: the target of engaging 50 farmers was exceeded by 38%; the target of 332 schools was 97.9% met. For the first objective, engaging farmers through the good practices course, we recommend: i) expanding the course to more regional hubs; ii) offering it remotely; and iii) maintaining ongoing course availability regardless of the school calendar. Regarding the second objective, focused on schools, the material was considered punctual; a broader initiative is recommended in the form of a course for teachers, emphasizing the interdisciplinary nature of FNE  encouraging teachers from various subjects to engage with the Rolê Agroecológico program. Looking forward, with the operational procedures already established in 2024, the program aims to expand its targets for farmers and schools and support the evaluation of developing psychometric indicators. Contributions to the field include not only the implementation of an interdepartmental and intersectoral collaboration model for food system sustainability  by reconnecting schools with their territories  but also the development of evaluation metrics that consider the multiple determinants of planetary health, such as food and nutrition security, ecological resilience, and social equity, highlighting the cross-cutting integration between FNE and the planetary health perspective.",

    "abstract": "PCP Conexões is a 25-day integrative protocol designed to support sustainable habit change through daily self-reflection and guided micro-actions. Rooted in the PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act) cycle and adapted from ISO 9001 quality parameters, the protocol incorporates concepts from the Transtheoretical Model of Behavior Change (Prochaska & DiClemente), expressive writing, neurolinguistics, and improvement science. It has been implemented with over 360 participantsprimarily womenwho experience high emotional demands, sensory overload, and fragmented routines. The methodology emerged in 2020, when the authorafter more than a decade as a corporate executive in the field of quality management and people development, leading multidisciplinary teams of over 200 professionalstransitioned careers and applied continuous improvement principles to her own life to recover from burnout and infertility. From this intersection of high-performance expertise and lived vulnerability, a structured and accessible method was born, integrating technical rigor with human depth. PCP Conexões reframes the classic PDCA logic from an organizational tool into a personal, sensory, and emotional transformation model. The protocol moves away from masculine, linear models (such as the 21-day Heros Journey) and embraces the cyclical, intuitive, and sensory dynamics of feminine routinesespecially relevant in domestic, caregiving, and multitasking contexts. It respects individual rhythms while promoting consistent action through small, daily practices. Participants engage with daily prompts (via video, text, or workbook) designed to foster internal listening, self-awareness, and embodied presence. Each day includes a short written reflection (approx. 15 minutes), helping them formulate personal micro-commitments and gradually shift their behavior. No previous training or advanced education is requiredjust basic literacy and openness to self-observation. Designed as a light social technology, the protocol can be implemented in a range of contexts: community health programs, public schools, women's shelters, corporate well-being initiatives, and mental health services. Its low-cost, scalable nature and language accessibility make it a strong candidate for application within Brazils Unified Health System (SUS), especially through trained facilitators or community health agents. - Low adherence to lifestyle change programs due to lack of personalization and emotional support. - High rates of burnout, ansiedade, and insomnia related to disorganized routines and sensory overload. - Overload of women in caregiving roles with no structured time or tools for self-care. - Scarcity of accessible, low-cost methodologies for behavior change in saúde pública systems. - Difficulty sustaining health-related commitments without external pressure or clinical supervision. - Fragmentation between technical intervençãos and lived experience, especially in underserved communities. The PCP Conexões protocol has had over 360 participations across 18 guided editions, with several individuals choosing to repeat the experience in different life contexts. Each cycle represents a structured journey of habit transformation, grounded in daily reflection and embodied practice. More than 80% of participants report continuing the protocol's routines after the initial 25-day experience. Key resultados include: - Adoption of regular physical activity after years of inactivity. - Elimination of up to 14kg in weight without restrictive diets. - Recovery of healthy sleep patterns and reduction of ansiedade symptoms. - Return to professional and acadêmico activities after emotional exhaustion or caregiving burnout. - Strengthened decision-making, self-regulation, and time organization. - Increased emotional clarity, autonomy, and sustainable self-care practices. - The protocol has proven especially effective for individuals without access to terapia or structured programs, particularly women managing multiple responsibilities in emotionally demanding environments. Recomendações: - Pilot the protocol in Primary Health Units through trained community health agents or facilitators. - Integrate the protocol into mental health and promoção da saúde programs, particularly for women in vulnerable situations. - Use the workbook and daily materials as low-cost educational tools to encourage autonomy and continuity. - Promote facilitator training among professionals in education, saúde pública, and social services to expand reach. Desafios: - Institutional resistance to hybrid methodologies that combine scientific structure with subjectivity and sensory practices. - Scaling the protocol while maintaining depth and personalization. - Overcoming cultural paradigms around how habits are formed and sustained, especially in overburdened populations. - Ensuring continuous follow-up without clinical dependence or complex infrastructure.",

    "abstract": "The Reikilibra USP extension project aims to promote PICS with a focus on Reiki, standing out for its accessibility, low cost and reduced environmental impact. Developed at USP's Ribeirão Preto School of Nursing (EERP-USP), the project works to promote the physical, emotional, mental and spiritual health of the acadêmico community and the external population, through individualized care, workshops, partnerships and participation in events. Reiki, officially recognized by SUS since 2017, is a holistic therapeutic practice that promotes energy balance through the natural stimulation of intrinsic mechanisms for rehabilitation or maintenance of multidimensional health. Considered safe and effective as a complementary terapia, it has been gaining increasing acceptance in Brazil and other countries, especially in hospital settings. The initiative is in line with WHO guidelines, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the National Policy for Integrative and Complementary Practices (PNPIC), although it still faces structural challenges to its consolidation in the health system and in professional training curricula. The project carries out workshops, consultations and partnerships, promoting stress reduction and improving the qualidade de vida of participants. The Reiki sessions take place at EERP/USP, in the Ligiê Laboratory, a sensory environment prepared for integrative practices, and are conducted by certified Reiki practitioners made up of students, teachers and administrative staff. In addition to individual consultations, the project carries out educational and publicity activities on social networks and at acadêmico and community events. The project responds to the demand for integrative care in the face of increased stress and psychological suffering in the university environment and in saúde pública, promoting well-being through Reiki, health education and strengthening acadêmico belonging. The results observed indicate growing engagement from the acadêmico community. Between January 2024 and April 2025, 1,470 consultations were held at EERP-USP. The project carried out actions in other populations in the external community, including EERP-USP's freshman reception week (2024) with 80 visits; SMS-RP's 2nd municipal PICS week (2024) with 40 visits; state commemoration of the health worker (SMS-RP/2024) with 40 visits; VIII Symposium and XVII Humanization Meeting (2024) with 15 visits; CAPS III Psychosocial Care (2025) with 30 visits; EERP-USP Postgraduate activity (2025) with 43 visits and EERP-USP freshman reception week (2025) with 45 visits. Among the main challenges faced by the project are the need to expand dissemination to reach a wider audience of students, teachers and administrative staff at EERP-USP; to ensure the long-term institutional sustainability of the actions; to overcome the still limited recognition of PICS as effective promoção da saúde strategies and to encourage, in the acadêmico context, the ongoing training of Reiki practitioners. Given these challenges, we recommend formalizing institutional policies that integrate Integrative and Complementary Health Practices (ICPHPs) in a structured way into healthcare in the university context, with a focus on promoting the physical, emotional and mental well-being of the acadêmico community. The effective incorporation of these practices contributes not only to strengthening the integral health of students, teachers and staff, but also to deepening institutional ties with the external community, through care and welcoming actions aimed at the population. In addition, it is important to encourage the production of scientific evidence that validates the benefits of PICS, as a strategy to consolidate its legitimacy and ensure its definitive inclusion in acadêmico spaces and saúde pública services.",

    "abstract": "The use of aromaterapia from Brazilian flora for pain relief in elderly people receiving home care in the city of São Paulo/SP. Brazil has been experiencing the aging phenomenon in recent decades, and according to the latest 2022(1) Census, the population over 60 reached 15.6%. An increase of 56% compared to the last Census in 2010, when this corresponded to 10.8% of the Brazilian population. We owe this increase in life expectancy to advances and access to technologies in the health area, improvements in the population's living conditions, changes in lifestyle, access to information on promoção da saúde and prevenção and control of vaccine-preventable diseases. However, the elderly population, consequently, ends up living with chronic non-communicable diseases for a longer period and pain is one of them, often resulting from pathologies of the musculoskeletal system, circulatory system, trauma, among others. Pain, according to the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP)(2), is \"an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage\" and is considered a major saúde pública problem. The Unified Health System (SUS), through its Integrative and Complementary Health Practices (PICS)(3), offers 29 therapeutic resources to complement conventional tratamento, either alone or as part of complex medical systems or medical rationales. Utilizing one of these therapeutic resources, Brazil offers a rich biodiversity, including the Amazon, Caatinga, Cerrado, Atlantic Forest, Pantanal and Pampa. And we find in the Cerrado biome a great diversity of species, from which essential oils are extracted, with indication and benefits for relieving pain and inflammation, such as: Copaíba (Copaifera officinalis)(4), Erva Baleeira (Cordia verbenacea)(5), Pimenta de Macaco (Xylopia aromatica)(6) and Sucupira (Pterodon emarginatus Vogel)(7). Working as an aromaterapia nurse in Primary Health Care, during my home visits to this population over 60, after a nursing consultation, systematization of nursing care and pain assessment, I conduct an aromaterapia session with a selection of these oils diluted in vegetable oil, applied topically to the pain site for a specified period of time. In my clinical practice, I have found that the use of aromaterapia with essential oils from Brazilian flora in elderly individuals with dor crônica undergoing home care in the city of São Paulo/SP, demonstrates pain relief, improved qualidade de vida, improved health, improved mobility, reduced social isolation, and strengthened interpersonal relationships. This enables the use of this complementary terapia as a powerful and effective tool in combating dor crônica.

    "abstract": "The appreciation of integrative and complementary practices in the Unified Health System (SUS) reinforces the importance of initiatives that rescue popular knowledge and strengthen the links between community, territory, and healthcare. In particular, in the context of atenção primária, practices such as the use of medicinal plants, traditional care, and integration with the environment are fundamental elements for a broader approach to health. In this scenario, community gardens emerge as powerful spaces for promoting health, environmental education, food security, building bonds, and social integration, with great potential for action in the territory of basic health units. The university extension project Sharing knowledge about medicinal plants among Unified Health System users and undergraduate health students will be developed in the community garden of the Salles Netto Municipal Health Center, linked to a family clinic, located in an urban area of the municipality of Rio de Janeiro. The territory in which the Municipal Health Center is located is characterized by social diversity, a strong presence of traditional knowledge, and challenges related to promoção da saúde and the prevenção of chronic diseases. The community garden already exists in the area and involves the participation of users and professionals interested in the articulation between health, the environment, and popular culture. The initiative brings together nursing, medicine, and pharmacy students from the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, in coordination with professionals from the Salles Netto Municipal Health Center health team and users in the territory. The proposal aims to promote the exchange of knowledge, care experiences, and educational practices centered on the use of medicinal plants, with a focus on strengthening atenção primária and comprehensive care. This action is part of the principles of critical and transformative university extension, connecting teaching, service, and community in a collaborative proposal for action in the Unified Health System. The activities developed in the project include conversation circles on health and traditional practices, practical workshops on the preparation of teas, ointments, natural seasonings, and composting, in addition to continuous encouragement for the cultivation, management, and harvesting of medicinal plants in the community garden. These actions are planned jointly by students, professionals, and community members, valuing popular protagonism and active listening as central elements in the collective construction of knowledge. The main target audience is made up of users of the family clinic and residents of the territory, with special attention to groups that already participate in actions in the garden, such as the elderly, community health agents, and local leaders. The students involved will have the opportunity to experience daily life in the area, develop communication and health education skills, learn about the traditional use of medicinal plants, and reflect on the role of the university in transforming local realities. The educational and cultivation incentive actions therefore promote effective coordination between teaching, service, and the community. The project encourages the use of natural, accessible, and culturally significant resources as a form of care and prevenção, in addition to contributing to food sovereignty and environmental care. By integrating acadêmico knowledge with popular practices, the project also aims to contribute to a more critical professional training, sensitive to social needs and committed to the principles of the Unified Health System. By promoting the conscious use of medicinal plants and collective cultivation in the garden space, the project consolidates this practice as an accessible and effective strategy for healthcare, strengthening territoriality, and promoting citizenship. The community garden thus becomes a symbolic and concrete space where the knowledge of the territory and collective health practices meet, fostering autonomy, belonging, bonds, and social participation. The proposal addresses the devaluation of popular knowledge about medicinal plants in the Unified Health System, the low level of integration between the university and the territory, and the scarcity of collective health practices involving users and professionals from basic health units. It also seeks to overcome the fragmentation of educational actions in atenção primária and the lack of community spaces for care and well-being, promoting the use of vegetable gardens as a strategy for collective health, healthy eating, social integration, and appreciation of territoriality. Although still in its early stages, active community participation, strengthening of the bond between users and professionals, and the revival of the daily use of medicinal plants as part of healthcare are expected. For students, the development of communication skills, educational practices, and greater social awareness is anticipated. The community garden is understood not only as a space for cultivation, but also as a territory for promoting health, environmental education, intergenerational exchanges, and collective knowledge building. Among the challenges anticipated are the limited cultivation area, the need for inputs and tools, the continuity of actions, and the engagement of health professionals and users. It is recommended that the implementation of similar practices take into account the local context, encourage active listening to the community, and strengthen institutional partnerships. Experience indicates that community gardens linked to atenção primária can be powerful spaces for care, training, and social transformation, as long as they are sustained by emotional bonds, shared knowledge, and collective participation.",

    "abstract": "This report presents the experience of the Espaço Terapêutico Bem-estar do Servidor (ETBE) in providing care to the employees of the Goiânia City Hall during the year 2024, with a focus on Integrative and Complementary Health Practices (ICHPs). The ETBE is composed of a multidisciplinary team of permanent staff members, with diverse training in areas such as Acupuncture (Traditional Chinese Medicine), Auriculoterapia, Phytoterapia, Reiki, Family Constellations, Chromoterapia, among others. The service operates by prior appointment and walk-in demand, from 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. Sessions for therapies like Acupuncture and Auriculoterapia are offered in up to 10 sessions, while other therapies are provided in single sessions, depending on the recommendation. In 2024, a total of 10,996 procedures were performed. The main complaints that led individuals to seek care were general pain (60%), tension (44.7%), insomnia (36.5%), depressão (20%), and other issues (43.5%), such as ansiedade and fatigue. The most commonly received therapeutic practices were auriculoterapia (90.7%), acupuntura (76.7%), cupping terapia (47.7%), moxibustion (38.4%), Reiki (36%), bioresonance terapia (39.5%), flower essence terapia (23.3%), aromaterapia (16.4%), electroacupuntura (12.8%), family constellation terapia (8.1%), reflexology (3.5%), and ozonoterapia (3.5%). The satisfaction survey conducted between November and December 2024, via an electronic form, revealed a high approval rate: 92.8% of users rated the service as very good and 7.2% as good, with no average or poor ratings. Regarding the resolution of complaints, 37.2% reported complete resolution, 36.1% reported relief, and 26.5% reported partial improvement. No patient indicated a lack of benefit. The majority of services were provided to staff assigned to the municipal departments of Health, Education, Finance, Culture, Communication, Womens Affairs, and Social Development. Critical issues identified included the long waiting list for Acupuncture and Naturopathy, limited infrastructure (tratamento rooms with partitions that compromise privacy), and the concentration of services among staff located at the Municipal Administrative Center (Paço Municipal) and administrative hubs. As part of the action plan, proposed measures included infrastructure improvements to ensure greater comfort and privacy, implementation of a scheduling management system to reduce waiting times, expansion of educational activities focused on managing stress and dor crônica, annual surveys to monitor service quality, continuous team training, and outreach strategies to increase access to the ETBE for employees outside the main administrative centers. User feedback emphasized the humanized care and both physical and emotional benefits of the integrative practices, such as pain relief, improved sleep, reduced ansiedade, and an overall increase in well-being. The ETBE has been consolidating itself as an innovative initiative in integrating Traditional and Integrative Medicine into the public sector, promoting health and qualidade de vida in the workplace. This experience reinforces the potential of Integrative and Complementary Practices as permanent health policies, contributing to the reduction of absenteeism, improved productivity, and the creation of a healthier work environment.",

    "abstract": "Auriculoterapia is an integrative practice for the promotion, maintenance, and restoration of health which has previously been studied in both animal and human models [1,5,7,10,12,15,16,17,19,20,25,26,27,29,30]. It has been widely implemented across Brazil through the SUS Integrative Practices Program [21,22,23]. This microsystem-based terapia has also been integrated within a spiritual context, in a large Universalist religious institution located in Rio de Janeiro. Combining healthcare with a biopsychosocial-spiritual approach, this model emphasizes a holistic view of the individuals experience of illness and health, encompassing physical, social, emotional, and spiritual dimensions [3,24]. Auriculoterapia integrates multiple medical rationalities  understood as organized systems of knowledge and practices that guide different perspectives on health and disease. Among these are Reflexology, Neurophysiological Biomedicine, and Traditional Chinese Medicine [13]. In this spiritual context, Vibrational Medicine was integrated, recognizing the body's energy centerscommonly known as chakrasas vital elements of the subtle energy system, culturally understood to be associated with multiple dimensions of physical, emotional, and spiritual well-being [6,8,28]. This report aims to describe the experience of implementing baseado em evidence auriculoterapia in a spiritual context. The practice is free of charge and carried out by trained volunteers of the institution, under the supervision of a healthcare professional certified in Evidence-Based Auriculoterapia by UFSC/Ministry of Health (in Brazil) - all volunteers sign a confidentiality and non-disclosure agreement. Weekly sessions are held, typically ranging from 5 to 8 encounters, with duration of approximately 10 minutes, during which no more than 10 auricular points are stimulated. The methodology includes: (1) welcoming with a compassionate presence, followed by anamnesis and a comprehensive structured interview  on the first day; (2) application of mustard seeds on selected auricular points according to the main complaint  with therapists assigned randomly for each session [21,22]; (3) Laying on of hands over the auricular region and areas corresponding to major chakras  a widely accepted practice across spiritual traditions, previously investigated in the context of pain management [4,18,28]. During the anamnesis, the following data are collected: sociodemographic characteristics, clinical history, medication use, complementary and spiritual practices, and the intensity and frequency of physical and emotional pain (before, during, and after tratamento), using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)[9,21,25,27,28,29]. All individuals who seek this practice at the institution receive care from a team of trained volunteers and all information is stored in the Institutions Historical Records, with informed consent from each participant, in accordance with Law No. 13.709/2018 (General Law for the Protection of Personal Data  LGPD)[2]. This institutional initiative promotes care for individuals experiencing suffering and social vulnerability within a spiritual context that embraces diverse beliefs without engaging in religious proselytism. The approach expands care through a biopsychosocial-spiritual model, enhances scientific inquiry in naturalistic and community-based contexts, and values complementary health practices as part of a broader model of care  one that requires rigorous investigation without relinquishing epistemological courage. A key challenge lies in consolidating the scientific legitimacy of integrative practices applied in spiritual and religious settings. Additional challenges include the continued systematization of collected data, the strengthening of volunteer therapist training, the refinement of the care protocol, and the promotion of scientific dissemination of this experience through naturalistic research within and outside spiritual contexts, including comparisons between both contexts as conducted previously in studies involving other practices [28]. It is recommended to encourage researchers to investigate the effects of these practices in such settings, recognizing the importance of overcoming the reluctance to study spiritual contexts - acknowledging that science is ultimately shaped by what scientists choose to explore [14].",

    "abstract": "The activity took place at Centro Universitário Multivix Vitória, within the context of the Pediatric Academic League, which is composed of medical students from various acadêmico years. The Leagues meetings are extracurricular and aim to explore and deepen topics not addressed in the formal curriculum. At the students request, a lecture was held on the topic Applications of Homeopathy in Pediatric Practice, presented by Professor Brunna Vila, a pediatrician and specialist in integrative pediatrics. The in-person session lasted 1 hour and 30 minutes and was attended by 28 students. During the lecture, the historical foundations of homeopatia were discussed, along with its therapeutic principles, like the law of similars, minimal doses, and experimentation in healthy individuals  in addition to its clinical applications in pediatrics. The session also covered Brazilian legislation related to integrative practices and the most common indications for homeopatia in pediatric care. Moreover, a clinical case was presented and space was provided for critical discussion, allowing reflection on the limitations, benefits and challenges of incorporating homeopatia into medical practice. This experience aimed to address several challenges currently faced in medical education. The inclusion of integrative and complementary practices remains largely absent from formal medical school curricula, which limits the therapeutic repertoire available to students. Additionally, there is a noticeable lack of institutional space for non-conventional subjects such as homeopatia, often excluded from acadêmico programs due to the absence of qualified faculty, limited time within the curriculum, or a lack of pedagogical openness. The Pediatric Academic League proved to be an ideal setting for the discussion of such topics, reflecting a genuine concern and commitment to integrative and complementary practices. It offered students the opportunity to explore real-world approaches, including clinical case discussions and examples of prescriptions that led to positive resultados. In doing so, the lecture helped to demystify homeopatia, clarify its theoretical and practical foundations, and promote critical thinking. It also broadened students understanding of complementary approaches to conventional biomedical tratamentos. The lecture had a positive impact on the members of the Pediatric Academic League, as reflected in the students interest, engagement, and active participation during and after the session. A significant level of unfamiliarity with homeopatia as a practice recognized by the Brazilian Federal Council of Medicine and incorporated into the Unified Health System (SUS) through the National Policy on Integrative and Complementary Practices (PNPIC) was observed. Students expressed spontaneous curiosity and a desire to further explore the topic. They suggested future meetings with opportunities to discuss a greater number of clinical cases and explore potential hands-on experiences. It is recommended that other Academic Leagues  as student-led extracurricular spaces  also consider including content on integrative practices such as homeopatia, as this contributes to expanding the therapeutic repertoire of future physicians. Given that homeopatia is a medical practice officially recognized by the Brazilian Federal Council of Medicine and supported by saúde pública policies through the PNPIC, it is also recommended that it be formally included in the medical school curriculum.",

    "abstract": "This report presents an Integrative Medicine experience implemented at the Brazilian National Cancer Institute (INCA), a high-complexity public hospital. The initiative was conceived by pediatrician Nilene Gouvêa, the physician responsible for the implementation of Pediatric Integrative Oncology at INCA in October 2022. It is based on the Brazilian National Policy on Integrative and Complementary Practices (PNPIC/SUS), aligned with World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations, and enhanced through Anthroposophic Medicine. The multidisciplinary team includes the physician, two nurses, a physiotherapist, a nutritionist, an occupational therapist, and an art therapist, all invited to join the project. The objective of this pilot initiative was to promote sensory integration with nature within the hospital setting, aimed at visually impaired children with cancer (in this report: retinoblastoma and rhabdomyosarcoma) receiving outpatient care, by strengthening affective bonds and therapeutic involvement. The sensory journey was inspired by Goethean phenomenology and structured around the concept of the twelve human senses described by Rudolf Steiner, in which each sense represents a portal to experience and connect with the world. The session began with a team introduction and an invitation to a renewed sensory experience (sensory reactivation). This was followed by exploration of natural foods prepared by the nutrition team, stimulating smell, taste, and touch. Subsequently, the children and their caregivers walked through a forest path built with natural elements (pebbles, vegetables, leaves, wind, bird songs, and running water), activating the senses of movement, balance, hearing, and vitality. The experience fostered deep immersion in each childs inner world. Observed resultados included enhanced emotional resilience, connection to the environment, and increased motivation for continuing tratamento. Caregivers also reported significant improvements in the children's well-being. Each child created a symbolic sensory garden, allowing for the elaboration of inner experiences through sensory engagement. The active participation of the interdisciplinary team was key: occupational terapia promoted autonomy and engagement; physioterapia contributed with postural balance and body awareness; nutrition offered personalized and emotionally resonant nourishment; anthroposophic art terapia enabled deep emotional expression through clay modeling, fostering embodied presence, imagination, and sensory-affective integration. Nursing ensured emotional segurança, active listening, and continuous support.Beyond its therapeutic value, this session inspired the development of a permanent initiative to incorporate nature into the hospital environment as part of the Pediatric Integrative Oncology service at INCA. This innovative program was highlighted in Revista Rede Câncer, issue no. 52 (October 2023), emphasizing the benefits of integrating conventional and complementary care within the Brazilian Unified Health System (SUS), with documented improvements in qualidade de vida, symptom relief, and reduced hospital readmissions. In conclusion, this pilot program innovatively integrates clinical, sensory, and emotional dimensions, reaffirming the therapeutic, pedagogical, and humanistic value of Integrative Medicine in pediatric oncology care. The initiative demonstrates feasibility, replicability, and significant potential for broader implementation across saúde pública institutions in Latin America.",

    "abstract": "This relato de experiência describes the implementation of integrative health practices at the Medical Specialties Outpatient Clinic (AME) of Santa Casa de Assis during the Yellow September mental health awareness campaign. The intervenção aimed to promote the emotional well-being of health professionals who work in a high-pressure institutional environment. The initiative responded to the increasing demand for preventive mental healthcare strategies inside corporate environments in order to promote the appreciation of life and psychological balance in the workplace. The stated project objectives were to:  Provide moments of self-care, relaxation and inner connection.  Immediately reduce stress and ansiedade.  Encourage the use of simple well-being techniques which can be daily applied by professionals themselves. Chronological Descrição A total of 28 people, upon prior registration, were involved in the practical activities. They were divided into two groups of 14 participants and each group took part in two different practices throughout the month. At the end of the activities, on September 30th, the lecture \"Inner Awakening: Overcoming, Happiness and Purpose\" was held. Practice Steps  Welcoming and grounding (5 min): conscious breathing and a welcoming environment.  Mobility and stretching (5 min): neck, shoulders, arms, and spine.  Standing postures (15 min):  Tadasana (Mountain Pose);  Adapted Utkatasana (Gentle Chair Pose);  Twists and balance (Tree Pose).  Breathing techniques (5 min): Nadi Shodhana (alternate nostril breathing) and sighing breath (loud exhale).  Guided relaxation (15 min):  Application of lavender essential oil to cupped hands for mindful inhalation;  Music: Águas da Amazônia  Japurá River;  Gently return to awareness with slow breath and movements.  Time for spontaneous sharing at the end of the session. Materials and Resources: Institutional chairs, yoga mats and rugs, lavender essential oil, a sound system for therapeutic music, and verbal guidance using welcoming language. Participants Twenty-eight professionals from the institution participated voluntarily, they were all wearing formal clothing. The activities were adapted to the workplace context and respected the available time and room available. Theoretical Framework The practice integrated Principles of Yoga, Mindfulness, Aromaterapia, and Music Therapy, providing sensory and emotional stimuli that benefit presence and well-being. Ethical Aspects The actions took place within the institutions Yellow September program, with verbal consent expressed at the time of registration. The implementation of yoga in the corporate environment of AME Assis is an initiative that has been carried out since 2019, also integrated into the institutions Health Professional Week. Main Desafios  Adapting techniques to formal outfit and the physical structure of the environment.  Maintaining focus and an atmosphere of introspection amidst the work routine.  Overcoming initial skepticism or resistance from some professionals. Further Impact Desafios were overcome with careful adaptations, a welcoming approach and conscious guidance that made the experience accessible and transformative for all participants. There was an immediate improvement in the participants bodily, emotional, and mental awareness. The atmosphere at the end of the sessions was one of calm, lightness, and gratitude. Testimonials (Qualitative) Woman 1 (2530 years old), with insomnia and depressive disorder diagnosis: Wow, it had been a long time since I felt this light. That music took me to a place of deep peace and stillness - my whole body relaxed, like I was in nature. It reminded me of going to the waterfall. Woman 2 (3540 years old), anxious and with an explosive personality: My Gosh, this practice is so relaxing. By the end of it, it felt like my body was floating. Such enormous peace  I do want to do this continually! Lessons Learned Even when done sporadically, the practices offered techniques that professionals can carry into their personal routines, promoting self-care autonomy and greater awareness of their mental and emotional health. The objectives were fully achieved: there was voluntary participation, positive feedback, an immediate sense of well-being, and a desire to continue the practices. Recomendações  Including integrative practices in the institutional calendar.  Assigning a dedicated professional to carry out PICs, ensuring continuity and expansion of the actions.  Providing simple materials such as essential oils and therapeutic playlists. Future Directions:  Expand the frequency of the practices;  Implement evaluation protocols with daily or weekly well-being feedback to identify needs;  Integrate PICs into the regular initiatives for professional appreciation. Contribution to the Field The experience at AME Assis demonstrates that Integrative and Complementary Practices (PICs) are powerful, feasible, and low-cost tools for promoting the mental health of SUS professionals. Caring for the caregiver directly impacts the quality of care provided to patients.",

    "abstract": "The Tourist Resort of Guaratinguetá, located in the countryside of São Paulo State, is home to natural areas of ecological and scenic importance, such as the Anthero dos Santos Ecological Park. In this context, the Municipal Health Department, responding to the need for innovative strategies to address non-communicable chronic diseases, mental health conditions, and psychosocial distressoften exacerbated by urban, disconnected lifestyleshas been promoting care actions that integrate SUS principles with complementary and integrative practices. In June 2025, a two-day training course was held to award an International Certification in Nature Connection Facilitation. Fifteen health professionals from the municipal network participated, including physicians, nurses, dentists, nutritionists, psychologists, and community health agents. The entire training took place at Anthero dos Santos Park, using its trails and green areas as the setting for the activities. The course was led by a trainer from the Sírio-Libanês Institute of Education and Research and certified by the Forest Therapy Hub, an international organization dedicated to nature-based therapies. The methodology included theoretical foundations of ecopsychology, forest medicine, and biophilia. The program offered theoretical discussions, sensory experiences, and group reflections, followed by a participatory evaluation. The training addressed both collective care and self-care, highlighting nature as a promoter of holistic health and fostering ecological health education. During the training, it was necessary to adapt the physical space, as the site was originally designed only for collective leisure, outdoor activities, and contact with nature. The lack of a suitable indoor environment required the use of a former playroom, which was adapted by the Municipal Health Department team to serve as a classroom. The urban environment surrounding the park generated noise that occasionally interfered with the sensory practices. Nevertheless, with support from the facilitator and participants cooperation, activities proceeded without significant disruption. There was also initial resistance from some professionals who perceived the approach as subjective or distant from conventional clinical practice. However, this perception changed over time through engagement with theoretical content and lived experiences. An open dialogue environment and active listening were key to strengthening group involvement. This experience expanded participants professional repertoires, encouraged the integration of human and environmental care, and strengthened health practices grounded in local context. Participants reported positive personal and professional impacts. It is recommended that topics related to ecological health and integrative practices be incorporated into continuing education for health professionals. The methodology proved feasible, low-cost, and highly replicable. To scale up such initiatives, the involvement of local health management, partnerships with recognized training institutions, and the use of accessible natural areas are essential. Valuing interdisciplinary knowledge and aligning with the National Policy on Integrative and Complementary Practices (PNPIC/SUS) are crucial for success. The systematization of this experience reinforces the relevance of nature-based therapies within saúde pública, fostering more humanized, sustainable care practices aligned with the principles of planetary health.",

    "abstract": "The project Drawn to Nature aims to promote mental health and well-being for professors and staff at the University of Campinas (Unicamp), organized by the Corporate School (Educorp), taking place in the space and with the expertise of biologists from the Botany and Zoology areas of the Museum of Biological Diversity (MDBio) at the Institute of Biology. It is a course at the intersection of biology and art, where participants are brought into contact with nature through the observation of plant and animal specimens (living, herbarium-mounted, or taxidermied), followed by free expression of these observations using expressive graphic materials and creative writing. The course is conducted as an art terapia process, under the guidance and supervision of an art therapist and biologist. Each class includes the following stages: 1- A visit to an exhibition area of the Museum of Biological Diversity (MDBio) (https://www.ib.unicamp.br/museu_zoologia/, https://www.instagram.com/mdbiounicampigsh=ZWxnbDViZ3NtMXBr), guided by biologists specialized in the subject, providing striking visual and tactile stimulation through natural elements from various species; 2- Geometric drawings based on 3, 4, and 12-sided figures (progressively developed from base-3 geometry in the first session to base-12 in the fifth), positioned within circles to form mandalas; 3- Expressive activity to externalize thoughts and feelings using art materials (drawing and painting), through shapes and colors, with no requirement for prior artistic experience or adherence to aesthetic standards; 4- Creative writing prompted by reflective questions and statements about self-awareness and workplace/social relationships; 5- Sharing session, where participants who wish may present their work and share perceptions, thoughts, emotions, and feelings. Activities 2 through 4 are conducted with a curated soundscapemusical playlists designed to facilitate the intended resultados of the process. These include:moments of reflection on the world of work through nature-inspired activities; emotional release via visual expression guided by art terapia; relaxation to ease persistent mild ansiedade; activation to counteract lethargy in cases of mild yet persistent depressão; stimulation of creativity in dealing with workplace relationships, tasks, and challenges. In the final session, participants create a biographical art book compiling their individual works, allowing them to reflect on the experience and its impact on their inner world. The main goal is to provide reflective moments on the working world through nature-inspired activities that allow for the release of thoughts and emotions. The course duration is 18 hours, delivered in six weekly sessions of three hours each. Materials required include art supplies such as specific drawing and painting papers, colored pencils, soft pastel, watercolor paints, brushes, compasses, rulers, graphite pencils, and erasers. We were concerned with three issues: 1- The 18-hour duration with six 3-hour weekly sessions might discourage supervisors from releasing their employees; 2- Low enrollment due to the graphic expression activities, with potential participants self-excluding because they believe they can't draw; 3- Mixing employees from different hierarchical levels could inhibit more subjective expressions. There was no conflict or mismatch between the art terapia processbridging the objectivity of biological sciences and the subjectivity of mental processes tied to workplace environments and dynamics. On the contrary, the more detailed and accurate the biological information about the observed specimens (their interactions, behaviors, habitats, etc.), the deeper the subjective engagement and the more creative the results in both visual and written expression. The diversity in educational and occupational levels within the participant group (including technical administrative or lab staff, undergraduates, postgraduates, researchers, and professors) did not interfere with the depth of emotional engagement. The course successfully achieved its reflective goals, which were visibly expressed through participants verbal and graphical output. Mental health and well-being care within corporate environments, as proposed here, aligns with the concept of cultural prescriptions in museum settings and gains balancing power through the synergy of nature, art, and science. The number of participants should not exceed 20 in order to create a safe and connected environment conducive to free expression. Weekly sessions are ideal for balancing psychological processing time with minimal disruption to work duties. We are currently offering the course to the second group and our plan is to offer it to 8 more.",

    "abstract": "The Brasilia´s School of Healing Souls (SHSB) was founded in September 2016, with the purpose of sharing knowledge and memories about the art of healing, through blessing or prayer, using the healing power of medicinal herbs, anchored by the healer Maria Bezerra. For the school´s members, the meaning of life is to find one´s gift, and the purpose of life is to offer it. At the health centers, the practice of blessing takes place at UBS 1 (Lago Norte), UBS 6 (Taguatinga) and UBS 9 in São Sebastião. In the UCs, the school has been working with the Cerrado Recconection Program, at the spaces of the Ecological Parks: Riacho Fundo, Asa Sul and Sucupira (Planaltina), cooperating in order to value environmental sustainability in the relationship between biodiversity and spirituality, strengthening ecosystem services, in the category of cultural services, which cover health, spirituality and social well-being. Thus, thousands of people benefit from listening, guidance and prayer through blessing in face-to-face and virtual services. Resources such as fitoterapia, aromaterapia, laying on hands and music terapia are also used to enhance blessings according to Traditional, Complementary and Integrative Medicine (TCIM). In this connection between health, spirituality and the environment, SHSB strengthens the expanded concept of Health, bringing together prayers and knowledge in appropriate places to promote well-being and help people's health. On previously announced days and times and in partnership with the Health Department and the Brasília Environmental Institute, each year the services expand and gain space in the various reports and invitations to take part in events, as well as the accounts of those who live the experience and the benefits of the blessing. From 2016 to 2019, services were primarily provided at health centers, with around 8,100 visits. Between 2020 and 2021, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the services were provided virtually twice a week, on average with more than 400 services per week, and currently the list of names for the virtual blessing reaches more than 1,000 services. From 2022 to the present day, blessings have been provided both in person and virtually, with more than 18,000 visits a year. The School of Healers through its blessing practices, has participated in approximately 9 news reports and around 12 events, such as RAÍZES (Meeting of Herbalist, Traditional healer, Midwives and Shamans), the Care Space at the XV and XVII National Health Conference, the March of the Daisies, among others. The challenges currently faced are the large number of people who receive care and the small number of healers. Despite annual training, not all of them continue to volunteer, and the practice of traditional healer is not qualified under the PNPIC. However, the healers who remain are strengthened in their practice of service by reports such as: My mother used to take me to a traditional heale when I was little and I never found one again, and now you're here, thank God and Today I left here better than when I arrived, my headache is gone. Thus, also with the support of established partnerships, healing continues to be an ancestral art of saying good things that promotes health and well-being, integrates practices with the community and contributes to valuing knowledge and recognizing environmental biodiversity, an important link between all beings in nature and in institutions.",

    "abstract": "This report presents the experience of implementing integrative practices in a high-complexity federal hospital in Rio de Janeiro, highlighting the challenges faced in conducting an approved research study on integrative practices within the hospital context. The narrative emphasizes the discrepancy between the institutional discourse promoting research and the practical barriers to enabling innovative initiatives, such as meditação and the Feldenkrais Method®, for both patients and healthcare professionals. The National Policy on Integrative and Complementary Practices (PNPIC) proposes a model of comprehensive care that may represent an innovation within Brazils Unified Health System (SUS), especially in light of the rise in chronic conditions and population aging. This account describes an experience between 2013 and 2014 at the National Institute of Traumatology and Orthopedics (INTO/MS), a federal hospital that has an ethics committee, scientific commission, and internal research support infrastructure. The project, approved by institutional bodies, was implemented in the rehabilitation department with the goal of offering integrative practices to patients with dor crônica. Although officially approved, the work faced numerous logistical barriers and institutional resistance, such as competition for physical spaces, lack of support in organizing sessions, failures in supplying the snacks agreed upon with the clinical research department (Peclin), and a lack of institutional recognition for the time spent on the intervenção. Additionally, the author launched the \"MEDITA-INTO\" project, which offered regular meditação sessions and Feldenkrais® Method classes to the institutions professionals. The initial uptake was positive, but the activity was discontinued due to the lack of space and logistical support. Despite the institutions pro-innovation rhetoric, the practice revealed structural, cultural, and management barriers. Despite the barriers, the research was successfully conducted and resulted in benefits perceived by the participants. The sessions contributed to pain relief, improved well-being, and active engagement in self-care. Additionally, the experience raised awareness among some internal sectors and demonstrated that it is possible to implement integrative practices even in environments resistant to change. Participants reported positive effects from the sessions, including improved pain perception, better sleep, increased body awareness, and a sense of being cared for. The project also encouraged internal reflections on the need for greater integration between care, education, and research. It is recommended that policies for the effective institutional support of research on integrative practices within the SUS be established, with recognition of the professionals involved, the provision of minimum infrastructure, and a commitment to established agreements. The main challenge is to transform the discourse of innovation promotion into concrete practices, ensuring resources, adequate spaces, and protected time for such activities. Institutional resistance must be acknowledged as a real limiting factor and addressed through awareness strategies, intersectoral dialogue, and cultural change.",

    "abstract": "In 2019, the Undergraduate Nursing Course at the UFRJ-Macaé Multidisciplinary Center developed the discipline \"Introduction to Integrative and Complementary Practices,\" in collaboration with the Medicine, Pharmacy, and Nutrition courses. This was the first PICS discipline developed at UFRJ. It aimed to present the National Policy for Integrative and Complementary Practices (PNPIC), created in Brazil in 2006 (Brasil, 2006), and to broaden knowledge of different integrative practices through theoretical and practical interdisciplinary experiences. The discipline is optional and consists of 30 hours of instruction. It has been offered eight times to date, with the participation of over 200 students. Teachers are members of different undergraduate health courses at UFRJ-Macaé and are complemented by guest professionals from the Municipal Health Network of Macaé, Brazil, who have training in integrative practices. In 2024, a similar discipline began in Rio de Janeiro, created by the Music Therapy course in conjunction with the Nursing, Occupational Therapy, and Pharmacy courses at UFRJ. It was offered only once and had 10 students. Lectures are taught by professors from the various courses as well as by technicians who work with different integrative practices offered by the university or by professionals from the Unified Health System (SUS). The offered discipline proved important for the students' training as it promoted comprehensive knowledge of PICS through sensitive experiences that produced subjectivity. These experiences made the students realize the importance of a holistic approach as well as interdisciplinarity and interprofessionality to expand integral care in the SUS (Arruda et al., 2025). In Macaé, lectures have already been held on Music Therapy, Floral Therapy, Reiki, Medicinal Plants And Herbal Medicines, Meditation, Yoga, Integrative Community Therapy, Circular Dance, Traditional Chinese Medicine, Ayurveda, Shantala, and Homeopathy. In Rio de Janeiro, the following practices were covered: Floral Therapy, Music Therapy, Traditional Chinese Medicine, Homeopathy, Reiki, Meditation, Yoga, Integrative Community Therapy, And Medicinal Plants and Phytoterapia. Students present other approaches that are part of the 29 integrative practices included in the PNPIC at the end of the program in seminars so that they have access to information on as many practices as possible. It is necessary to expand knowledge of integrative and complementary practices in undergraduate health courses because they are still incipient, generating relative ignorance among most professionals (Tesser, Souza, & Nascimento, 2018). The PNPIC values soft technologies, such as welcoming and listening, which are fundamental to promoting care in primary healthcare, and go against the medicalization of life (Pereira, Souza, & Schweitzer, 2022). Teaching about integrative practices at the university level is still predominantly optional and informative. Health courses should take an integrated approach aimed at interaction and complementarity between different types of knowledge (Nascimento et al., 2018). At the end of the semester, students evaluate the course using a written form and during a collective discussion. The Macaé students' evaluations indicate that the course contributed to the following: a greater understanding of PICS and its importance in promoting integrality in the Unified Health System (SUS); stimulation of the use of PICS for self-care; interest in seeking training in one of the presented practices; perception of the importance of interdisciplinarity and interprofessionality in acadêmico training and future professional practice due to integration with teachers and students from different courses; perception of the importance of scientific proof of PICS; perception of the relaxation and well-being promoted by the practice experiences during classes. Moreover, students from UFRJ courses in Rio said the subject helped them reduce prejudice about some of the presented practices and sparked interest in researching PICS. It also promoted interest in training in integrative practices, provided an interdisciplinary and interprofessional experience, and presented theory followed by practical activities that promoted knowledge of how PICS contributes to balanced care of the body, mind, and emotions, promoting self-knowledge and stimulating self-care to avoid stress and improve qualidade de vida. Teaching about PICS should be made compulsory so that all health students have access to this knowledge and can direct patients to qualified professionals, contributing to comprehensive care in the SUS. It is also important that the teaching process promote integration between teachers and students from different courses to stimulate interdisciplinarity and interprofessionality. The teaching process should be based on theoretical and practical activities that aim to raise students' understanding of self-care and stimulate training in integrative practices.",

    "abstract": "This relato de experiência, aligned with the thematic axis Education, Training, and Capacity Building in TCIM: empowering health professionals, explores the teaching of ozone terapia as a complementary integrative practice within pharmaceutical education. In accordance with Brazil's guidelines for Traditional and Complementary Integrative Medicines (TCIM), the importance of incorporating this technique into acadêmico curricula is highlighted as a strategy for fostering humanized, interdisciplinary, and baseado em evidence training. Ozone terapia is a therapeutic approach that employs ozone (O), produced from medical-grade oxygen (O), and has shown efetividade in wound healing, dermatological sanitation, and infection control. As noted by Bocci (2011), the technique is both efficient and economically feasible, thereby expanding access to safe therapeutic alternativesespecially in resource-constrained settings. In Brazil, ozone terapia is regulated by Resolution No. 572/2013 of the Federal Council of Pharmacy (CFF), authorizing qualified pharmacists to apply advanced therapeutic technologies, including ozone terapia, within an ethical and clinically responsible framework. The integration of this subject into acadêmico training contributes to the development of technical and humanistic competencies, preparing professionals for innovative, interdisciplinary roles that align with contemporary saúde pública demands. In this context, the teaching of ozone terapia enhances the pharmacists role as an active care provider, encouraging critical, baseado em evidence practice focused on improving patients qualidade de vida. Academic environments that facilitate engagement with integrative practices support the construction of more diverse, effective, and patient-centered healthcare models. Despite growing recognition of complementary integrative practices (CIPs), the teaching of ozone terapia faces significant challenges within pharmacy curricula. One major barrier is the lack of awareness among students and faculty, who often lack familiarity with its scientific foundations and clinical applications. This gap contributes to low engagement and perpetuates misconceptions and unjustified resistance. Ozone terapia is frequently mischaracterized as an unvalidated or unsupported practice, even though it is referenced in scientific literature and endorsed by professional regulations. Such prejudice, even among healthcare professionals, underscores the need for educational initiatives that promote accurate information and foster interdisciplinary dialogue to break through long-standing misinformation. To address this scenario, four university extension eventstwo in-person and two virtualwere organized to disseminate information on ozone terapia and encourage student engagement. The response was remarkable: the first edition alone attracted over 100 participants. Attendees included students from Pharmacy and Biology programs at the School of Biological and Health Sciences of the Universidade do Estado do Rio de Janeiro (UERJ), as well as faculty members and technical staff, highlighting the educational relevance of the technique. These initiatives reveal genuine demand for qualified information about integrative practices. Events like these not only disseminate technical knowledge but also stimulate critical thinking and elevate scientifically supported alternative therapies. An additional factor is the social impact of ozone terapia. Due to its low cost, segurança, and ease of application, it offers a tangible opportunity to broaden healthcare accessparticularly in underserved communities. Equipping pharmacists with the skills to apply this technique helps democratize therapeutic resources and reinforce a more humanized, inclusive care approach. Overcoming these challenges requires more than curricular reformit demands a shift in institutional mindset, grounded in scientific recognition, innovation, and alignment with societal health needs. The reported experience revealed significant interest and engagement among participants in the extension activities on ozoneterapia. Four sessions were heldtwo in-person and two virtualwith approximately 320 attendees, including Pharmacy and Biology students from the State University of Rio de Janeiro (UERJ), as well as faculty and technical professionals. The rapid enrollment, with over 100 registrations in the first edition, underscored an unmet demand for scientific and technical content on integrative practices. Participant evaluations indicated that 84% experienced a notable improvement in theoretical and clinical understanding of ozoneterapia, while 76% expressed interest in further exploring the topic within their acadêmico or professional journey. These findings highlight the value of interdisciplinary, baseado em evidence educational approaches in fostering innovative therapeutic practices. This initiative contributed to expanding educational horizons, reducing stigma, and positioning ozoneterapia as a promising tool in promoção da saúdeparticularly in communities with limited access to conventional care. To strengthen the role of ozone terapia in pharmaceutical education, structural and cultural barriers must be addressed. Key issues include:  Insufficient technical and scientific understanding, resulting in resistance to curricular inclusion  Lack of faculty training, limiting in-depth and responsible instruction  Shortage of updated didactic materials, affecting teaching quality  Low volume of national scientific output, which constrains acadêmico and institutional debate Recommended strategies include:  Integrating ozone terapia as a complementary component within the Complementary and Integrative Practices discipline in pharmacy programsincluding potential mandatory inclusion  Offering targeted training for faculty and technical staff, supported by experts and reference institutions  Promoting acadêmico researchsuch as case studies and ensaio clínicosto validate the technique and increase scientific recognition  Organizing interdisciplinary events, workshops, and seminars to engage multiple health disciplines and foster informed debate  Employing ozone terapia in university extension projects, particularly in low-income communities, as a means of delivering low-cost and effective healthcare solutions The development of ozone terapia within pharmaceutical education demonstrates that, despite persistent obstacles, the field presents substantial acadêmico and professional opportunities. Its clinical application is scientifically grounded, professionally regulated by the CFF, and carries meaningful social impact. To fully realize its potential, educational programs must combine scientific rigor with ethics, social responsibility, and innovative thinking. Investing in the teaching of ozone terapia means empowering pharmacists as key players in healthcare promotion, expanding their therapeutic repertoire, and strengthening their contributions within care networks. Transforming prejudice into knowledge and misinformation into qualified practice is essential to firmly establish ozone terapia as a safe, effective, and accessible alternative , with positive implications for professional development and the health of Brazils population.

Difficulties in obtaining certified plant species were overcome through strategic partnerships with acadêmico institutions and public bodies, ensuring greater recognition and support for volunteer activities. Volunteer actions resulted in an increase in biodiversity in the medicinal plant garden, with the creation of seven new beds, and consequently, a significant expansion of the botanical collection, incorporating more than 20 new certified medicinal species. Throughout the period, the plan to develop interest and promote greater participation was realized through the strengthening of community ties, practical activities among the volunteer team, as WELL as the formation of bonds with partner institutions. During the period, a notable increase in active weekly participation was observei, currently with approximately 30 volunteers, including local residents, students, the elderly, and health professionals, demonstrating the initiative's capacity to engage diverse segments of the population. Thematic workshops on the rational use of medicinal plants were carried out and scheduled to occur bimontly throughout the year, addressing the use of anxiolytic, digestivo and anti-inflamatory plants, for e amole, with the donation of approximately 50 seedlings, promoting health education and access to natural resources for person-centered care, in the context of One Health. The initiative also managed to consolidate a university extension project and integrate it into the local government's initial environmental preservation project, ensuring greater institutionalization and sustainability for the project. The formalization of intersectoral partnerships and alignment with national public policies, such as PNPMF and PNPICS, supported by the global traditional medicine strategy 20252034, is recommended to ensure the longevity of similar initiatives.",

    "abstract": "This report describes the experience of implementing therapeutic gardens as part of the Integrative and Complementary Practices (PICS) within the Unified Health System (SUS) in the municipality of Vitória, Espírito Santo. It contextualizes their development within the municipal policy of Integrative and Complementary Practices (PICS), where therapeutic gardens were implemented to promote well-being, autonomy, and sustainability. The initiative was built on the principles of One Health and comprehensive care, incorporating traditional and scientific knowledge. From the 1990s to the present day, therapeutic gardens have been consolidating themselves as a tool for promoção da saúde, popular education, strengthening atenção primária, and community integration. The use of this practice, combined with intersectoral public policies, demonstrates the potential to reduce social determinants, promoting autonomy, well-being, and the connection between health, the environment, and local culture. Descrição The practice of therapeutic gardens was developed in the municipality of Vitória, Espírito Santo, as a strategic health initiative. The city has been a pioneer in implementing PICS since 1990. Located in an urban area with social and cultural diversity, the practice emerged from the appreciation of folk knowledge, traditional medicines, and the need to offer gentler, more natural care methods. Beginning in the 1990s, with the inclusion of phytoterapia as the city's first PIC, the first therapeutic garden projects emerged, linked to health units, schools, and psychosocial care centers. The practice involves the cultivation of medicinal plants, workshops on fitoterapia preparation, garden cultivation and care workshops, and educational activities, in partnership with both the Vitória City Hall and external institutions. Today, therapeutic gardens are present in 16 services, 13 of which are run by the health department and another 3 by partner services. They offer activities such as cultivation workshops, tea preparation, aromatic salts, and other integrative practices. The proposal emerged as a strategy to promote health and strengthen atenção primária, fostering the rational use of fitoterapias and intersectoral collaboration with the environment, education, and social assistance. Issues Addressed Therapeutic gardens were conceived as a response to multiple saúde pública challenges, including:  Offering more natural health-promoting practices that can reduce medicalization;  Lack of access to natural therapies;  Provision of welcoming spaces and terapia with soft technologies in CAPS (Personal Care Centers).  Disconnection between traditional knowledge and clinical practice;  Lack of spaces for community life and collective care in the territories;  Low recognition of promoção da saúde actions in the healthcare model and loss of traditional and popular knowledge. Over the years, 23 therapeutic gardens were established in the municipal health network of Vitória, Espírito Santo. Of these, 10 were discontinued for various reasons. Today, the health services have 13 therapeutic gardens, in addition to another 3 in partner services. During the implementation process of each therapeutic garden, guardians were trained to care for the space. An average of 10 people were trained per garden, totaling approximately 200 people. Another point to consider is the holding of workshops on the topic, involving the participation of service users and staff. These workshops discuss topics such as plant cultivation, plant care, and the conscious use of medicinal plants, according to service needs. The average number of workshops is no less than 50 per year, with an average attendance of 20 people per workshop. However, the same people often participate in multiple workshops, making it difficult to quantify the total. With the implementation of therapeutic gardens and the activities developed, we can affirm that:  Improved user acceptance and participation in therapeutic gardens;  Integration and improvement of practices with health services and partners;  Increased the number of therapeutic garden guardians, with skills to care for and ensure the quality of the final product;  Conducted workshops on health, the environment, self-care, and sustainability;  Expanded the rational and safe use of medicinal plants;  Coordination between popular education initiatives, food security, self-care, and mental health;  The acceptance of the gardens by the community and professionals has provided greater autonomy and the provision of new forms of care. Furthermore, in November the Municipal Forum of Integrative and Complementary Practices is held, where on the last day the Municipal Meeting of Therapeutic Gardens is held, with approximately 30 participants per year who share their experiences with guardians of the therapeutic gardens. Although progress has been significant, there are still challenges to be overcome and achievements to be achieved, including:  Expansion of PICS training for more professionals in the SUS network and partners;  Monitoring and tracking therapeutic gardens, their potential and care;  Integrating the practice with other service activities, enhancing care;  Strengthening and integrating education, health, and environmental policies;  Incorporating therapeutic gardens into more health facilities;",

    "abstract": "Lifestyle-related diseases not only impact individuals qualidade de vida (QoL), but also account for 71% of global deaths and 54.7% of deaths in Brazil, posing significant challenges to health systems. Ayurveda, a traditional Indian system of medicine, is considered a lifestyle medicine that aims to maintain optimal health through the adoption of self-care routines. The present study aimed to develop a method for applying Ayurvedic daily practices within the Brazilian Unified Health System (SUS) and to assess the role of these practices in improving the QoL of healthcare professionals from the Family Health Strategy of Paty do Alferes/RJ, Brazil, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants were recruited through active outreach, involving in-person visits to health units. Selected professionals received guidance through theoretical and practical educational activities, referred to as Living Ayurveda. The guidance was delivered in modules totaling 20 hours, based on and adapted from the concept of Trayopastambha, with a focus on four key areas: Nutrition, Sleep, Mental Relaxation, and Physical Movement. Quality of life was assessed using the WHOQOL-BREF, a validated QoL questionnaire provided by the World Health Organization, self-administered before and after the intervenção. Results were analyzed statistically in the third month. The method developed followed a person-centered approach, placing the individual at the core of their care and supporting them in decision-making. All topics were structured and implemented according to the following format: Anchor (a practice for connecting with intention and bringing focus to the present moment), Discussion (theoretical exploration of the topic using Ayurvedic concepts) and Challenge (suggested practices and/or activities for implementing Ayurvedic concepts in daily life). The study was developed in response to the high prevalence of lifestyle-related diseases and their effects on the physical and mental well-being of healthcare professionals, which were further exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic. It also addressed the lack of structured, accessible, and culturally adapted non-pharmacological strategies for promoção da saúde within the Brazilian saúde pública system, as well as the underutilization of traditional systems of knowledge, such as Ayurveda, in this context. A total of 30 healthcare professionals participated in the study, which took place from July to October 2021, over a three-month period. The material used in the intervenção gave rise to a practical guide entitled AYURVEDA: Observe, Experience & Transform  A Practical Guide for Maintaining Good Health, designed to facilitate the introduction of Ayurvedic daily practices into the healthcare system while considering regional specificities. The content was intended for both healthcare professionals and the general public, with the goal of promoting holistic health. Data from the WHOQOL-BREF questionnaire showed improvements in perceived QoL in the physical, psychological, and environmental domains (p > 0.05), while the social domain did not show statistically significant results. The physical domain, which includes aspects such as energy/fatigue, sleep/rest, and mobilityelements directly addressed by the intervençãoshowed the greatest increase in average total QoL score: from 61.07 (±18.26) before to 72.02 (±13.39) after the intervenção. The findings highlight the potential of Ayurvedic daily practices to promote health and improve qualidade de vida in a feasible, non-pharmacological, and low-cost manner. However, expanding the application of this approach within saúde pública systems presents some important challenges. These include sustaining long-term engagement with the practices, incorporating them effectively into the routines of health services. Further research with broader populations and extended follow-up periods is essential to strengthen the evidence base and guide the development of public policies that support the integration of traditional knowledge into contemporary health strategies.",

    "abstract": "Integrative and Complementary Practices (ICPs) have played a fundamental role in promoting health and preventing diseases. An elective ICP course was incorporated into the medical curriculum, offering students the opportunity to explore and experience innovative therapeutic methods. Foot reflexology is an integrative and complementary practice that uses compressive foot massage to stimulate reflex points in the feet, promoting therapeutic benefits through the stimulation of nerve endings. This technique aids in pain control, stress and ansiedade reduction, and alleviates physical and emotional exhaustion. The reported experience refers to the application of foot reflexology by 6th-semester medical students at Estácio de Sá University, Città Campus, during the Integrative Practices course held in June 2025. The goal of the activity was to promote relaxation, well-being, and reduce stress, ansiedade, and pain among participants. The methodology consisted of a practical session conducted in the skills lab, with 32 students participating. The instructor began the activity with an explanation of key reflex points on the feet related to organs and patient complaints. The session began with foot mapping, followed by pressure application on reflex points, nerve stimulation, and observation of body responses. Students worked in pairs, performed a brief anamnesis with their colleagues, and then guided the person to a stretcher to begin the session. Pain levels were recorded before and after the technique was applied, with each session lasting an average of 30 minutes per participant. Materials used included cotton, 70% alcohol for foot hygiene, moisturizing cream, reflexology foot charts, and disposable paper sheets to cover the stretchers. The experience proved enriching and effective as a complementary practice for promoting holistic care. During medical training, emotional burnout is commonly observed, driven by various structural and social factors. Students face overwhelming acadêmico workloads, performance pressure, and high internal and external demands, contributing to chronic stress, ansiedade, and fatigue. Major contributing factors include: an intense curriculum combining lectures, lab practices, clinical sessions, and long on-call shifts; normalized sleep deprivation in medical environments; irregular eating habits, lack of time for leisure and self-care and family and societal pressure for continuous excellence that fuels an unattainable ideal ofperfection. At the end of the session, participants reported feelings of lightness, relaxation, relief, and well-being. Many also reported improvements in mild pain. The activity highlighted the value of integrative practices in self-care and stress management, broadening students' perception of complementary healthcare approaches. Foot reflexology should be more widely promoted and implemented in health services due to its low cost and therapeutic benefits. Reflexology practitioners advocate its efetividade in supporting general well-being and treating chronic conditions and stress. Being a non-invasive technique and well accepted by the public, its inclusion in holistic healthcare contexts can significantly contribute to humanized care.In this context, there is an urgent need to implement institutional strategies focused on physical and mental health and to value integrative practices as complementary tools for well-being. Foot reflexology presents itself as a relevant option, offering students an opportunity to reconnect with their own bodies, relieve stress, and promote physical and emotional balance.",

    "abstract": "The UCLA Center for East-West Medicine (the Center) has spent over 30 years developing a Chinese medicine-centered integrative care model. This East-West approach has proven to be safe, effective, and affordable, and has been promoted globally through a series of international training initiatives. In 2011, the director of the Center, Dr. Hui, emphasized the importance of training more integrative atenção primária talents to Chinese integrative medicine (IM) professionals on an international conference held in Shanghai, and had the opportunity to present this idea to key leaders in Shanghai. Later between 2013 and 2016, the Center partnered with the Shanghai Association of Integrative Medicine (SAIM) under the leadership of its president, Prof. Wenjian Wang, to launch a 20 million Yuan government-funded training program for over 12,000 non-TCM community physicians and health workers. This 110-hour program equipped participants with basic TCM skills to meet growing demand for integrative services at the community level. Implemented in three phases, the program included curriculum development, large-scale in-person training, and the introduction of international best practices in community health. The Center participated in online modules, program design, and assessment. In 2015, a one-year visit of Prof. Jing Zhao from China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences (CACMS), was inspired by the Centers successful approach in training physicians with biomedical background in learning Chinese medicine. This has led to further collaboration upon her return. By 2017, Prof. Jing Zhao, with support from Chinas Ministry of Science and Technology, launched a 2-week international training program in CACMS, Beijing, for biomedical-trained health professionals from developing countries, with the Center as co-organizer. Each cohort trained 20 participants and focuses on the latest clinical and research developments in IM. The program included global recruitment, a diverse curriculum of lectures, site visits, and practical sessions, and a post-training engagement mechanism to build international networks. These two training projects illustrate the adaptability of the East-West integrative approach to different audiences-frontline clinicians and international medical leader-and highlight key strategies for effective dissemination. By presenting the Centers experience, this paper aims to inform the development of globalization of IM. While the Center was committed to promoting the international application of IM, implementing large-scale training programs required substantial support and funding. This was especially true for the collaborative project in Shanghai, which involved a broad training scope and significant regional impact. Although the Center had proposed this idea in a paper published in 2011, it was not until 2013-when the Shanghai Office of Traditional Chinese Medicine issued a policy document on strengthening community-level TCM services-that the SAIM was able to take the lead in applying for and securing government funding. This critical financial support made it possible to successfully launch and implement the training program. Another major challenge was how to effectively promote IM knowledge. In the Shanghai project, beyond securing government support, the program engaged 17 local health departments from various counties and districts. A strict code of conduct required participants to maintain over 95% attendance and achieve at least 90% on the final assessment to receive certification. Training performance was also tied to individual evaluations, enhancing both participation and skill acquisition. In the Beijing project, beyond in-person training, a sustainable information-sharing mechanism was created. Even during the COVID-19 pandemic, the program continued sharing IM knowledge and anti-epidemic practices through mutual medical supply donations and online meetings, significantly enhancing the trainings impact and continuity. In the Shanghai project, the Center participated in 110 hours of in-service training to four cohorts totaling 12,000 health professionals in Shanghai who had been trained in biomedicine. The training equipped them with up-to-date knowledge and practical skills in IM. Graduates who passed the assessments successfully applied the East-West model in grassroots healthcare settings, such as community clinics and primary hospitals, thereby improving access to safe, effective, and affordable medical services. In the Beijing project, the Center has trained approximately 80 biomedical health professionals from 18 countries and established collaborations with institutions such as Jagiellonian University in Poland and the Serbian Society of Integrative Medicine. These efforts have significantly contributed to the global recognition and dissemination of the East-West integrative medical model. From these two projects, we can draw the following lessons: 1. Tailoring implementation strategies to specific audiences is crucial for advancing integrative healthcare models. In the Shanghai project, the primary goal was to apply IM approaches in atenção primária settings. Therefore, the training emphasized practical techniques and clinical methods. In contrast, the Beijing project aimed to use training as a platform to help trainees to have better understanding of the depth and breadth of IM in China. 2. Promoting IM internationally requires targeted partnerships with diverse institutions and organizations. Both projects show that collaboration with professional organizations related to IM significantly increases the likelihood of securing official support, achieving broader, higher-quality dissemination. In both of the above cases, our goals were successfully achieved- IM knowledge was effectively disseminated to the target audiences, and the projects generated sustainable impact. These successful experiences offer a model for collaboration with various types of international partners: beginning with in-depth communication to understand mutual needs, followed by the development of tailored cooperation plans and the pursuit of shared goals, ultimately advancing the global promotion of IM. We hope that these lessons will offer practical, sustainable strategies and innovative pathways for future international collaboration, helping to foster the integration of Eastern and Western medicine and contribute meaningful solutions to pressing global health challenges.",

    "abstract": "Auriculoterapia is an integrative modality used to promote, maintain, and restore physical and mental health, with evidence from studies conducted in both animal and human models [1,2,3]. It has been widely implemented across Brazil through the SUS Integrative Practices Program [4,5]. This microsystem-based terapia has also been integrated within a spiritual context, in a large Universalist religious institution located in Rio de Janeiro. Combining healthcare with a biopsychosocial-spiritual approach, this model emphasizes a holistic view of the individuals experience of illness and health, encompassing physical, social, emotional, and spiritual dimensions [6,7]. Auriculoterapia integrates multiple medical rationalities  understood as organized systems of knowledge and practices that guide different perspectives on health and disease. Among these are Reflexology, Neurophysiological Biomedicine, and Traditional Chinese Medicine [8]. In this spiritual context, Vibrational Medicine was integrated, recognizing the body's energy centersas vital elements of the subtle energy system, culturally understood to be associated with multiple dimensions of physical, emotional, and spiritual well-being [9,10,11]. This report aims to describe the experience of implementing auriculoterapia in a spiritual context. The practice is free of charge and carried out by trained volunteers of the institution, under the supervision of a healthcare professional certified in Auriculoterapia by UFSC/Ministry of Health (in Brazil) - all volunteers sign a confidentiality and non-disclosure agreement. Weekly sessions are held, typically ranging from 5 to 8 encounters, with duration of approximately 10 minutes, during which no more than 10 auricular points are stimulated. The methodology includes: (1) welcoming with a compassionate presence, followed by anamnesis and a comprehensive structured interview  on the first day; (2) application of mustard seeds on selected auricular points according to the main complaint  with therapists assigned randomly for each session [4]; (3) Laying on of hands over the auricular region and body areas corresponding to major chakras  a widely accepted practice across spiritual traditions, previously investigated in the context of pain management [9,10,11]. During the anamnesis, the following data are collected: sociodemographic characteristics, clinical history, medication use, complementary and spiritual practices, and the intensity and frequency of physical and emotional pain (before, during, and after tratamento), using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). All individuals who seek this practice at the institution receive care from a team of trained volunteers and all information is stored in the Institutions Historical Records, with informed consent from each participant, in accordance with Law No. 13.709/2018 (General Law for the Protection of Personal Data  LGPD). This institutional initiative promotes care within a spiritual context for individuals experiencing suffering and social vulnerability that embraces diverse beliefs without engaging in religious proselytism. The approach expands care through a biopsychosocial-spiritual model, enhances scientific inquiry in naturalistic and community-based contexts, and values complementary health practices as part of a broader model of care  one that requires rigorous investigation without relinquishing epistemological courage. A key challenge lies in consolidating the scientific legitimacy of integrative practices applied in spiritual and religious settings. Additional challenges include the continued systematization of collected data, the strengthening of volunteer therapist training, the refinement of the care protocol, and the promotion of scientific dissemination of this experience through naturalistic research within and outside spiritual contexts, including comparisons between both contexts as conducted previously in studies involving other practices [10]. It is recommended to encourage researchers to investigate the effects of these practices in such settings, recognizing the importance of overcoming the reluctance to study spiritual contexts - acknowledging that science is ultimately shaped by what scientists choose to explore [12].

    "abstract": "The implementation of Integrative Community Therapy (ICT) in Piraquara (Paraná) began in 2018 as an initiative led by two municipal health workers: a saúde pública physiotherapist and a family and community physician. Both professionals were active in Primary Health Care and already trained as community therapists. The initiative aimed to expand mental health access due to long wait times for psychological care, focusing on individuals in distress regardless of diagnosis (Municipal Health Council, 2022). In 2019, the practice was incorporated into the Municipal Health Plan following its approval at the 13th Municipal Health Conference. Later, during the 14th Conference in 2022, the expansion of ICT was approved, integrating it into the care network of the Psychosocial Care Network (PCN) (Piraquara, 2017; Municipal Health Council, 2019; 2022). Thus, this relato de experiência aims to present medical students reflections, as participants of the sessions, on the integration of ICT into the mental healthcare pathway in Piraquara, Paraná. The welcoming space of ICT also serves as a health education setting, fostering student engagement with the community and promoting the development of humanistic skills and competencies essential for more sensitive and comprehensive healthcare. Thus, 54 students participated in the sessions between May 2024 and June 2025, of both sexes, aged between 20 and 25 years. Among them were undergraduate medical students and Family and Community Medicine residents, who completed a form to record their reflections on the integration of ICT into the mental healthcare pathway in the municipality of Piraquara. Thematic analysis was based on the most frequently addressed topics (Piraquara, 2025). Between May 2024 and June 2025, 54 medical and residency students participated in ICT sessions and completed reflection forms. A thematic analysis was conducted based on the most frequently mentioned topics (Piraquara, 2025). ICT has become an important strategy in health education, promoting experiential learning through student participation in community-based care. It encourages reflection on \"light technologies\" such as active listening, welcoming, and community bonding, in alignment with public policies like the National Humanization Policy and the National Policy on Integrative and Complementary Practices. Among the main resultados, the integration of ICT into mental healthcare in the municipality was highlighted, emphasizing facilitated access, welcoming approaches, the strengthening of user-provider bonds, and interdisciplinary teamwork. Health education strategies and the recognition of ICT as a Brazilian Integrative and Complementary Practice were also mentioned, along with person-centered careall identified as strengthening elements of the Psychosocial Care Network. ICT was recognized for its complementary role in the prevenção and tratamento of psychosocial distress, as well as in promoting relational bonds and community strengthening. Another relevant point raised by the students was the successful implementation of ICT in Piraquara, considered a positive example that could inspire similar initiatives in other municipalities. Some weaknesses were also identified, such as the low student participation in collective activitiesonly 26.3% had experienced this type of engagementand limited knowledge about PICS, reported by only 40% of participants. Overall, the experience allowed students to reflect on practice and identify elements that strengthen the mental healthcare pathway, while also emphasizing the importance of the broader care network. As such, the formative potential of ICT was highly valued and qualified. There are still several challenges to consolidating ICT as a sustainable public policy. Key issues include the lack of permanent public funding and the need for continuing educationboth outlined in the PNPIC as responsibilities of federal, state, and municipal governments. Another challenge is the limited integration of PICS, particularly ICT, into undergraduate curricula, restricting students experiential and critical engagement with these practices in acadêmico settings. It is recommended that HEIs include PICS in their curricula and promote interdisciplinary learning to enhance student experience. These actions support the training of professionals for comprehensive care and reinforce ICT as a key strategy in mental and community health. The findings highlight the need to ensure the continuity and expansion of ICT within the saúde pública system and psychosocial care network.",

    "abstract": "This relato de experiência documents the implementation of the curricular component entitled Taoist Practices, developed as part of the Massage Therapy Technologist course at the Federal Institute of Education, Science and Technology of Paraná (IFPR), a federal vocational education institution in Brazil. Implemented between 2023 and 2025, the course consists of three modules delivered over 18 months, comprising five in-person sessions per module, each lasting three hours. The curriculum incorporates bodymind techniques derived from Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), such as Qi Gong, Ba Duan Jin, Lian Gong, self-massage, breathing techniques, meditação, joint mobilization, and meridian activation. Occupational risks related to poor posture and repetitive strain are widely recognized among students and healthcare professionals. In this context, TCM-based practicescombining breathing, posture, and mental focuswere introduced as a strategy to restore balance, improve body awareness, and promote self-care. These practices are officially recognized within Brazils saúde pública system and have shown promising results in enhancing physical and emotional well-being. In this implementation, each session offered a thematic focus and a safe, restorative space. The pedagogical approach emphasized embodied learning. Student feedback revealed that the integration of these practices fostered a range of benefits, including improved posture, physical conditioning, emotional regulation, and the development of therapeutic skills. Students reported sleeping better, breathing more deeply, and feeling more focused and calm. The practices were also seen as accessible, inclusive, and effective when practiced consistently. These resultados reinforce the role of TCM-based techniques in promoting well-being and professional preparedness in vocational health education. This initiative was developed to address three main issues in vocational health education. First, massage terapia students are vulnerable to occupational health problems such as repetitive strain injuries, physical fatigue, and emotional stress, yet curricula rarely offer structured time or strategies for self-care. Second, there is a need to move beyond the traditional biomedical model and include integrative practices in training programsespecially those already supported by saúde pública policies. Third, many professionals lack preparation to recommend or apply complementary therapies in clinical contexts, limiting their ability to promote integral healthcare and preventive care. The inclusion of TCM-based bodymind practices aimed to fill these gaps by strengthening personal health management and clinical competence. Student testimonials collected at the end of the course revealed a broad range of personal, pedagogical, and professional benefits. These insights offer a deeper understanding of how the learning and practice of bodymind techniques contributed to students development across multiple dimensions and were thematically organized into the following categories: Under the theme of body awareness and physical health, students described the techniques as a way to reorganize, strengthen, and activate the entire body through subtle movements, gentle breathing, and wide gestures. These embodied experiences fostered an increased sense of proprioception, postural alignment, and physical balanceskills crucial not only for self-care but also for safe therapeutic practice. In terms of occupational preparedness, students emphasized that the practices helped strengthen muscles, joints, body, and mindessential for applying therapeutic techniques. This feedback highlights the preventive potential of these exercises for musculoskeletal strain, as well as their contribution to sustaining long-term clinical performance. Participants reported feeling more confident in their physical readiness for hands-on work. In the realm of personal development and self-care, the practices were described as having helped me manage stress and develop body awarenessessential for a massage therapist. The integration of mindful movement and breathing into their routine supported emotional resilience, grounding, and the development of healthier work-life habits. Several students highlighted that these techniques offered relief from ansiedade and fatigue. The dimension of mental and emotional health was strongly present in student reflections. Comments such as Im sleeping better, breathing more deeply, and staying calmer and more centered illustrate the psychosomatic benefits reported. These changes were often perceived as interconnected with increased concentration, mood stability, and emotional presenceimportant for both learning and therapeutic relationships. The course also demonstrated relevance for patient resultados and health education. As one student noted, the practices can be taught to clients to extend session benefits and foster a sense of care and loyalty. This points to a transformation not only in students personal habits but in their therapeutic visionseeing themselves as educators and facilitators of self-care beyond the tratamento room. From a pedagogical perspective, students saw the component as integral to their education: This course component was essential in expanding my understanding of Lian Gong and Qi Gong. The structure of the course enabled not just physical practice, but also theoretical contextualization, creating meaningful connections between traditional health philosophies and their contemporary application. Finally, many highlighted the inclusive and accessible nature of the practices, calling them a democratic and inclusive practice with few contraindications, yielding excellent results when done consistently. This perception reinforces the appropriateness of these techniques for diverse populations and settings, particularly in public healthcare and community-based work. Overall, these testimonies affirm that the integration of TCM-based practices cultivated not only technical competencies but also reflective, empathic, and resilient professional identities. The course helped shape a more humanized, preventive, and sustainable vision of healthcare, aligned with contemporary challenges in saúde pública and education. This integrative pedagogical model can be adapted to other health education programsespecially in fields where professionals face physical or emotional risks and can apply integrative techniques to benefit clients. Physical education, nursing, and physical terapia are examples of areas where promoting self-care and preventive approaches is highly relevant. One key challenge is institutional support for embedding body-based integrative practices into formal curricula, which requires interdisciplinary collaboration and policy engagement.",

    "abstract": "The historical account of flower terapia stems from the scientific discoveries made in the 1930s by the English homeopathic physician Dr. Edward Bach, who described diseases as resulting from a disharmony between the human essence and their personality. Upon completing his studies, Bach correlated the emotional states of a person with the flower essences he produced. The purpose of Flower Therapy is to restore the positive state of the human personality by using flower essences to care for mental, emotional, and behavioral aspects of people. It can be used preventively, encouraging the concept of self-care and individual and collective care. (MINISTRY OF HEALTH - BRASIL, 2016) The terapia is based on a concept that overcomes the Cartesian division between body and mind with a perspective that integrates these elements into a dimension in which the mind assumes essential importance, since emotions alter the physical state through the action of the central nervous system. Positive emotions establish health, while negative states stimulate diseasehence the importance of speaking of \"emotional health.\" With this very particular and unique perspective, these implementations use the Saint Germain Flower Remedies system, which was developed in the 1990s by researcher Neide Margonari. The excerpt below describes what flower essences are, as well as supports their use and efetividade, considering that: Flower essences are natural, odorless, and highly diluted liquid extracts of flowers intended to balance emotional problems, operating on subtle levels and harmonizing the individual internally and with their surroundings. They are prepared from wildflowers at their peak of bloom, in the early morning hours, when the flowers are still damp with dew, obtained by harvesting flowers from untouched natural locations. The flower essence, which originates from the flowering plant, acts on the archetypes of the human soul, stimulating positive transformation in thought patterns and fostering inner development and emotional balance that leads to new behaviors. It is not a herbal remedy, fragrance, homeopatia, or drug. It can be used at any age, without interfering with other therapeutic methods and/or medications, enhancing them. The effects can be observed immediately in more sensitive individuals. (MINISTRY OF HEALTH - BRASIL, 2018). With this humanized and effective perspective provided by Flower Therapy, a movement began in 2018 to insert this practice into the Unified Health System/SUS, in Mato Grosso do Sul, when managers concerned and committed to their employees sought in Flower Therapy an effective implementation of look and care for this portion of citizens through the project Caring for Those Who Care. THE IMPLEMENTATION OF FLOWER THERAPY IN THE STATE OF MATO GROSSO DO SUL - BRASIL In the state of Mato Grosso do Sul, the introduction of a PIC, Flower Therapy, began in 2019 (specifically in March) in the municipality of Corguinho, Mato Grosso do Sul. Initially, Flower Therapy was introduced through informative lectures and personalized, welcoming and qualified sessions called \"therapeutic listening sessions,\" held twice a month. The municipality of Angélica-MS also began to be served with Floral Therapy with the same protocols of lectures and personalized services, with the only difference being that, there, the assistance offered was four days a month. Caring for the Caregiver, directing special attention to healthcare professionals who are on the front lines on a daily basis, was the driving force behind the introduction of this terapia. It is identified that Health Units have complexity and specific characteristics, however, these characteristics may change and acquire peculiarities depending on sectoral, municipal, state and national situations and, therefore, it is up to the therapist to integrate into the teams, facilitating the work axis and its functionality. Along with providing services to employees, months later we began integrating and working on the insertion of flower terapia into the actions of the Family Health Strategies - ESF, in the aforementioned municipalities and, to this end, we entered the Hiperdia, smoking, mental health and women's health programs, aiming to look at the human being and their emotions in all stages of life. One negative aspect is the lack of awareness of PICS across all levels. It's important to emphasize that each implementation has its own characteristics, whether in management, the operating format of the Family Health Strategies (ESF), or the personality of the unit coordinators. For the insertion of integrative and complementary practices - PICS we have to validate that the therapist needs to have some important prerequisites such as: validated training of the practice to be applied, fluency and empathy, understanding of the unit's routine, proactivity, knowing how to deal with users' difficulties at their different levels of education, understanding the reality of each user, having active listening and practicing welcoming, complementing and respecting the space of each professional to be able, in a simple way, to integrate into the network of health professionals/therapist/SUS user to, in this way, strengthen the \"gear\" of atenção primária. Reports from users and collaborators indicate that the provision of floral terapia by the municipal SUS (Unified Health System) has led to perceived improvements in emotional qualidade de vida, enabling acceptance, sharing, and accessible care. Among the many reports, one topic that stands out is frequently mentioned in requests and feedback during (re)consultations and consultations: \"emotional qualidade de vida.\" This topic is recurrent because users are able to perceive their emotions and deal with them, and to process and express their personal needs. \"Caring for the Caregiver,\" directing special attention to healthcare professionals on the \"front lines\" on a daily basis, was the driving force behind the introduction of this terapia, stemming from managers' concern for the \"integral health of workers,\" based on the concept that \"people can only offer what they have.\" Therefore, it is understood that caring for employees is, and always will be, the gateway to Integrative and Complementary Health Practices.",

    "abstract": "The systematic foot assessment for people with diabetes, coupled with structured education focused on preventive ulceration care, is a crucial pillar in preventing complications that directly impact morbidity, functionality, and qualidade de vida for these individuals. In this context, integrative and complementary health practices (PIS) emerge as promising allies. Among ICHPs, Reflexology stands out as a recognized therapeutic technique that applies pressure to reflex points on the hands and feet to promote organic balance, demonstrating relevant benefits in improving users' qualidade de vida. The integration of foot care recommended by national and international guidelines with the fundamentals of Reflexology, guided by Traditional Chinese Medicine principles, forms a valuable strategy for health professionals in preventive actions targeting people with diabetes. This approach was applied in training a group of elderly individuals with diabetes during a group therapeutic meeting held at a reference unit in Goiânia  GO, Brazil. The activity was led by a multidisciplinary team from the Reference Center for Elderly Care (CRASPI), in partnership with the \"Pegando no Pé\" Project from the Liga Multiferidas and NUTADIES/UFG. The therapeutic group is structured into five meetings, addressing themes aligned with the daily demands of diabetes mellitus (DM) self-management. In the meeting described in this report, principles of foot care aimed at preventing ulcerations were discussed, incorporating pedal and palmar reflex stimulation as complementary strategies. The methodological approach adopted was problem-solving, utilizing experiential activities and practical demonstrations, fostering active learning and participant engagement. Recognizing the challenge of implementing structured educational activities for foot care, the integration of PIS modalities into educational intervençãos, as well as their inclusion in protocols for self-management of Diabetes-Related Foot Disease (DRFD), appears promising. Specifically, from this reported experience, it was possible to observe participants' involvement in each proposed activity, demonstrated by their responses to questions about the content covered and sharing of personal experiences. On the other hand, the organization of systematic and reproducible educational intervençãos on this topic for this target population, which are also meaningful to participants, also presents a challenge. Thus, this experience contributes to addressing this demand through the development of a protocol for educational intervenção for DRFD self-management with a dialogical and proactive, less prescriptive approach, structured on theoretical assumptions of supported self-care and Traditional Chinese Medicine. During the meeting, significant engagement with the presented techniques was observed. The contextualization of the content in relation to daily practices demonstrated the usefulness and relevance of the adopted approach. The integration of Traditional Chinese Medicine Fundamentalsapplied to reflexology through hand and foot self-massageand foot care principles for people with diabetes (such as systematic inspection, hygiene, hydration, and identification of warning signs for pre-ulcerative lesions) awakened participants to a more attentive view of the importance of daily self-care for preventing DRFD complications. Furthermore, group discussions on the applicability of the techniques in daily life contributed to understanding the content and encouraged the adoption of learned practices as part of their routine. At the end, a booklet containing foot care information and a plantar reflexology map was provided. A musical experience involving a circle dance with foot choreography to folk music was also conducted. This last activity is understood to have reinforced the value of integrating traditional knowledge and scientific guidelines into a single intervenção, promoting not only the prevenção of diabetes complications but also attention to qualidade de vida through self-care. Training and monitoring people with diabetes for self-management of foot care represents an ongoing challenge for professionals serving this population. While the benefits of PIS in the health of people with non-communicable chronic diseases like diabetes are observed in literature and clinical practice, they often occur as isolated activities. The proposed integration of reflexology and self-massage into the range of preventive care for diabetes complications in the feet, as evidenced in technical-scientific literature recommendations, constitutes a promising strategy to be encouraged for its potential to promote self-care and contribute to improving the qualidade de vida for these individuals.",

    "abstract": "Experience report on the creation and maintenance of Biodanza groups in the Mental Health of the Unified Health System (SUS), as one of the Integrative and Complementary Health Practices (PICS) offered at the Nise da Silveira Municipal Health Assistance Institute (IMASNS) and the Clarice Lispector Psychosocial Care Center (CAPS), in Rio de Janeiro - Brazil. Because it's part of the Unified Health System (SUS), it's free and supports the fundamental premise of inclusion and democratization of access to quality saúde pública care. Mental health service users who receive tratamento at the institution participate alongside the community, which uses these services.The second group is located at CAPS Clarice Lispector, another facility in the Psychosocial Care Network, neighboring IMASNS, and was inaugurated in June 2025. It has approximately 25 students per week, among mental health professionals and users with intense psychological distress resulting from serious and persistent mental problems, including those related to the needs arising from the harmful use of alcohol and other drugs, and other clinical situations that make it impossible to establish social ties and carry out life projects. Biodanza is a system of human development and social transformation that uses music, meaningful movement, and group experiences as a way to access emotions and reconnect with the individual's emotional bonds with themselves, others (their fellow human beings), and the cosmoswhich organizes all forms of lifein a balanced, living, and pulsating rhythm. This system has been present in over 200 countries worldwide for over 60 years and promotes holistic health. It follows a biocentric vision that places life at the center, valuing all forms of existence. It is a primarily experiential therapeutic systemwhich is why it is best understood when experienced through its invitation to dance the life that reveals itself in the movement that pulses within each of us. The integration of human identity is the motto of Biodanza: thinking, feeling, and acting in harmonious consonance. To achieve this, it is necessary to progressively reclaim the knowledge of our instincts. This often dormant (and undervalued in capitalist society) understanding of our body: tissues, organs, and cells. Aligned with our ability to read the world through signs and thought, nature and culture can thus be integrated in a balanced way that promotes life. Each weekly session lasts an average of two hours and takes place in a rich, safe, and welcoming environment: through experiencesin the here and now, in a state of presencebased on musical semantics, with a selection of organic music that stimulates specific affective states, according to the theme proposed in each class. This work involves mental health projects with Biodanza groups that welcome a segment of the population often marginalized by societydue to their specific nature and the prejudice that excludes them from the activities and resources offered by the Unified Health System (SUS). Biodanza in mental health is therefore invited to flow and expand its boundaries, to embrace the uniqueness and diversity of the individuals it welcomes. Building this work requires listening, soulfulness, creativity, and a dose of boldness. It's important to note that IMASNS is a century-old institution, once one of the largest psychiatric hospitals in Latin America. It recently ended its psychiatric admissions and deinstitutionalized all former residents, discharged from long-term psychiatric hospitalizations, in 2021. This ensures care in freedom and the expansion of its promoção da saúde services to the general population through activities mediated by sports, art, and culture, as well as community outreach initiatives that value local knowledge and traditions. It is also part of a larger project in which old, decommissioned mental health buildings will be demolished to make way for a wooded park open to the community. Despite its transformation over the past few decades, it still carries the stigma that surrounds and imprisons madness, and is still remembered by the neighborhood and in the public imagination as the \"Hospital for the Mad.\" In this sense, we continue to carry out extensive awareness-raising and social awareness work to welcome and include differences. They quickly reveal transformative effects, as seen through the testimonies of students and professionals involved. Biodanza for mental health has proven to be much simpler than one might imagine and even more powerful than one might imagine. It is understood that the recovery of our humanity, which Biodanza proposes, through the strengthening of the sense of collectivity and the flourishing of nature within us all, produces health, well-being, and a new lifestyle. The inclusion of Biodanza as integrative care in the field of mental health clinics is a fertile field, still little explored, that aligns with the motto of the anti-asylum strugglefor a society without asylums, nor any form of violence, oppression, or silencing of individuals. The proposal of Biodanza classes allows the group to embrace differences and progressively restore people's dignity. By placing life at the center, above any prejudice, we are invited to occupy the center of the circle, taking our place in existence. As subjects who have a place, a voice, and a unique understanding of themselves, others, and the universe around us. Dancing together, we call upon the Unified Health System (SUS) itself to its original movementreclaiming its vocation as a promoter of health and a facilitator of life processes. This is the political, social, and emotional importance of Biodanza's inclusion in Mental Health. It is from this place of knowledge, extensive study, and affection that I listen and lead the groups. At each meeting, I witnesswithin the groupthe power of PICS in building a more just, egalitarian, and humane world. In Rio de Janeiro, we currently have only three active Biodanza groups. Encouraging Integrative and Complementary Health Practices (PICS) is essential, both in terms of their widespread dissemination and availability within the saúde pública system and in terms of creating a dedicated budget for the program, which would enable the expansion of services offered to the population and ensure the hiring of competent professionals to practice these PICS.",

    "abstract": "This experience took place in the mandatory Music Therapy internship field in Rehabilitation at the Instituto de Atenção à Saúde São Francisco de Assis HESFA; and focused on neuropediatric rehabilitation. Physioterapia and music terapia sessions occurred simultaneously in the pediatric physioterapia room. Thus, the work was carried out interdisciplinarily, aiming at the holistic care of the patient; that is, integrative care through music terapia, which has a global view of the subject's health and not only on their symptomatology and pathological etiology, but how this impacts the patient's qualidade de vida as a whole. One of the cases attended by music terapia was a 3-year-old patient diagnosed with mixed Cerebral Palsy (ataxic and hypotonic) and tetraparesis. During the first sessions, cognitive, motor, speech, and bonding delays were identified, which were worked on in music terapia sessions. The objectives were to establish a bond so that the mother was not requested by the patient during the sessions, to replace crying as a form of communication with verbalization, proprioception, motor stability, and executive function. In speech, we used songs known by the patient with simple expressions and onomatopoeias, associated movements with sounds, and used the provocative technique (BARCELLOS, 2008), which consists of leaving gaps in the song to be filled by the patient. In motor skills and executive function, we worked with fingerpicking on the guitar, focusing on fine motor skills in this activity; gross motor skills were also worked on using rhythm on the guitar and drum, proprioception with the guitar, gait using rhythm, among other activities. To create a bond with the patient, to facilitate adherence to tratamento, we used the sound envelope technique (CHAGAS, 2003), which aims to \"embrace\" the patient sonorously, providing a welcoming environment for them to feel comfortable. Significant improvements were observed throughout the therapeutic process, as in one session the patient verbalized \"I liked it\" when we signaled that the session was coming to an end, in others they said \"no\" when they did not want to do the activity and asked for the song \"Five Little Ducks\" by saying the word \"duck\". At another moment, we observed that the rattle was outside its circumference, so the patient stretched to pick it up and did so successfully, experimented with ways to make sounds on the guitar associating them with onomatopoeias, maintained a rhythm initiated by them on the back of the guitar, and walked with the help of the music terapia team to the waiting room, with their gait marked by the rhythm of a nursery rhyme (short stories whose verses rhyme and have a rhythm when told), which was presented to them in the session. The bond was established, as was adherence to tratamento, and, little by little, the mother's presence was no longer requested by the child. The patient's attention proved to be more lasting, being fully present for longer in the sessions. Music terapia work was carried out by the music therapist and the music terapia intern. The patient also underwent other therapies, such as physioterapia and speech terapia. Music terapia sessions contributed to the child's adherence to tratamento, facilitating the therapeutic bond in both therapies. Motor skills were a mutual therapeutic objective, and advancements were perceived in both physioterapia and music terapia sessions. Observing the results, we can conclude that the objectives outlined at the beginning were met and the patient showed significant improvements.",

    "abstract": "This paper aims to describe the development of the PICS UFRJ Network, composed of professors and technicians from the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ) with training in Integrative and Complementary Health Practices (PICS). The network was created to promote the expansion and dissemination of PICS knowledge through collaborative efforts focused on teaching, research, extension, and assistance. The PICS UFRJ Network was formed in March 2018 at a meeting attended by professors, technicians, and students from various university departments. The Network received institutional recognition in October 2018 from the Deliberative Council of the Center for Health Sciences.The Network's initial objectives were to facilitate communication and interaction among members, expand knowledge about PICS by creating undergraduate or graduate courses and extension courses to inform or train the public, promote scientific meetings to disseminate integrative practices, stimulate the development of PICS extension and research, and develop actions focused on PICS care for the university's internal and external public. In November 2018, the III PICS Meeting of UFRJ was held, organized by the Network. The central theme of this meeting was PICS care in different locations of the university, as well as the presentation of research and extension projects developed at that time. In the field of education, the inclusion of PICS in undergraduate and graduate programs was discussed, with a focus on the prospect of creating a Music Therapy Course at UFRJ. The following year, the undergraduate course in music terapia was established, and the elective course \"Introduction to Integrative and Complementary Health Practices\" began, offered jointly by the nursing, pharmacy, medicine, and nutrition courses at the UFRJ-Macaé Multidisciplinary Center. At the end of 2020, the PICS UFRJ Network held an internal online seminar in which the previous objectives were reaffirmed. However, the shift to online work processes and social isolation due to the pandemic made it difficult to maintain these objectives and scheduled activities. In 2024, the IV PICS Meeting was held at UFRJ, aiming to revitalize the PICS UFRJ Network, disseminate and discuss the activities carried out at the university.Round tables were held to discuss teaching, research, extension, and assistance at UFRJ. In 2020, the pandemic struck. Due to the consequences of social isolation and excessive online work, Network members took leave due to illness, interrupting activities from 2021 to 2023. Another factor that restricted the Network's development was the difficulty of expanding assistance activities with integrative practices to the internal and external public due to a lack of awareness about their importance and the absence of an institutional organization that promotes their effective implementation at the university. When planning the IV PICS Meeting, a Google Form survey was conducted on activities involving integrative practices at the university. Twenty professors and thirteen technicians responded to the survey. The professors are from different acadêmico units in Rio de Janeiro and Macaé, and they noted that the activities emphasize Teaching and Research more than Extension. Only professors from the undergraduate course in music terapia develop activities in assistance. The most cited PICS were: Medicinal Plants and Phytoterapia, Reiki, Floral Therapy, Meditation, Yoga, Music Therapy, and Ayurveda. The technicians with PICS training are few in number and are located in different units in Rio de Janeiro. They responded that their activities emphasize assistance more than teaching, research, and extension. The most cited PICS were: Traditional Chinese medicine, floral terapia, Reiki, music terapia, homeopatia, aromaterapia, and auriculoterapia. The oldest teaching initiatives are from the Pharmacy Course, with undergraduate and graduate programs. Next is the undergraduate Music Therapy Course and the elective course about PICS in Macaé. In 2024, another Introduction to PICS course was started in Rio de Janeiro among the undergraduate courses in Music Therapy, Nursing, Occupational Therapy, and Pharmacy. In healthcare, care for the population has been developed by technicians for a longer time at the São Francisco de Assis Teaching Hospital (HESFA), in primary healthcare. Teachers from the Music Therapy Course and music terapia technicians provide care for the population at the Maternity School, Institute of Psychiatry, Institute of Neurology, and School of Music. The Humanization and Welcome Sector has developed assistance for the internal public for several years, with technicians and volunteers offering care through different PICS aimed at promoting the health of students, technicians, and teachers. Regarding the extension and research of PICS, it has become clear that these are individual initiatives with limited integration within the network. At the conclusion of the IV PICS meeting, the need to establish an Integrative Health Center at UFRJ was discussed. This center would facilitate the integration and development of PICS, enabling the expansion of teaching, research, extension, and assistance to internal and external public. Create Extension and Research Programs in PICS to integrate participants from the acadêmico community. These programs would expand knowledge and scientific dissemination while contributing to community care. It is essential to institutionalize Integrative Health Centers in public universities to expand knowledge and care in PICS.",

    "abstract": "The three authors have been practicing Peter Hess® Sound Therapy with people who have Parkinson's disease at the Carioca Parkinson Association/APC since 2017, a civil society organization located in downtown Rio de Janeiro. APC is 17 years old , with the main objective of offering neuro-functional physioterapia to people with Parkinson's disease, aiding an average of 90 patients per month at a rate of twice a week. It also offers massage terapia, dance for Parkinson's, art terapia, legal support, as well as guidance and support for families and caregivers. The Brazilian Society of Neurology1 defines Parkinson's disease as \"a chronic and progressive neurological condition resulting from the degeneration of brain cells that produce dopamine, a neurotransmitter crucial for movement control. This degeneration leads to motor symptoms such as tremors, slowness of movement, rigidity, and postural instability, as well as non-motor symptoms that can affect sleep, mood, cognition, and other functions.\" The most obvious symptoms are bradykinesia, tremor, rigidity, lack of balance, as well as sleep disorders, depressão, ansiedade, irritability, difficulty concentrating and reasoning, memory lapses, as well as possible loss of smell, constipation, pain, fatigue, among others. The diagnosis is clinical, and tratamento combines dopaminergic medication with rehabilitation and, in some cases, surgery to implant DBS (deep brain stimulation) to relieve tremors and rigidity. Rehabilitation includes neurofunctional physical terapia, speech terapia, occupational terapia, and also various PICS (Integrative and Complementary Practices in Health), among which is PETER HESS® SOUND THERAPY, which is the practice we would like to report on here. Peter Hess® Sound Therapy is a vibro-acoustic technique for deep relaxationii, which has been refined since 1984, based on the methodology created by German engineer Peter Hess. It uses therapeutic-quality metal singing bowls, specially developed for working on the body. They are made of a bronze alloy (with other metals), which emit frequencies that resonate with the body. They come in different sizes and, during the session, are placed on (or near) the clothed patient and, when lightly struck with a specific mallet, emit sound and vibration, creating resonance with the body, promoting balance and harmony on a physical, mental, emotional, and energetic/spiritual leveliii. Sound Therapy acts deeply, reaching even cellular structures, moving the energy of the recipient, providing internal reorganization, with the body's liquid medium as the conductor. It is based on the principle that all living beings are vibrating systems. When this vibration system becomes unbalanced, the sounds and vibrations of therapeutic bowls can help harmonize the body, mind, and spirit, so that the person rediscovers their own vibrational frequency in their cellular memory.\" We want to highlight the benefits that this practice provides to the population served, in the context of the experience gathered during this period. We have been working at APC since 2017, during this time we have provided approximately 1,500 consultations. We offer sessions twice a week. We see up to six patients per day in 50-minute sessions. Participation and attendance are voluntary. Due to the progressive rigidity of the disease, patients choose the best position for themselves on the stretcher or sitting up on a chair. The three practitioners are trained in Peter Hess® Sound Therapy. In 2017, we started a pilot research project under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Wilma Costa Souza, with a group of nine patients, where validated questionnaires were used, and we obtained positive results in relation to the improvement in qualidade de vidaiv. The main challenges encountered were: the lack of a suitable location for the sessions and the irregularity in the frequency of the sessions. This makes it difficult to allow relaxation, which is the basis of PH Sound Therapy, and the adequate monitoring of the evolution of the patients' issues. The beneficial effects of Peter Hess® Sound Therapy are many, and we can observe in patients who receive regular sessions, as well as from the feedback they give us, that: they achieve deep relaxation that helps reduce stress, decrease ansiedade and fears, improving sleep quality, self-perception, and body awareness; they increase their self-esteem and self-confidence, dealing more positively with the challenges of the disease and everyday life; improved muscle and joint stiffness, relief from pain in general, and a visible reduction in tremors during the session; improved voice projection, postural balance, and gait development; in some cases, episodes of freezing were reduced, and constipation improved. The initial goal was achieved, but it can be improved to benefit more patients. To do this, we need to create a space that provides the necessary relaxation, promote actions to raise patient awareness about PH Sound Massage and the importance of maintaining regularity in the frequency of sessions, as this is what will stimulate the body's response, directly impacting the results of the beneficial effects. Peter Hess® Sound Therapy is used as a complement to healthcare in various therapeutic areas. Our experience shows that other groups of patients whose health conditions involve ansiedade, stress, sleep disorders, and pain in general, can greatly benefit from the effects of Peter Hess® Sound Therapy. On the other hand, there is the issue of the literature on Peter Hess Sound Massage, which is still concentrated on publications in Germany in German, making it difficult to disseminate the method and concentrating the practice among a few professionals, ultimately restricting interest in more comprehensive research, despite the growing interest of neuroscience in the function of sound vibrations for human health. i https://abneuro.org.br/2023/01/19/diretrizes-para-o-tratamento-da-doenca-de-parkinson/1 ii Pabst, Dra.

    "abstract": "This paper is an experiential report on the journey of the Ewé Collective, established in 2021, operating within the premises of FIOCRUZ. Its aim is to strengthen, systematize, and give visibility to complementary health practices rooted in traditional communities. Approximately 80% of the global population uses medicinal plants as a therapeutic resource (BRASIL, 2006). The World Health Organization (WHO) recognizes the contribution of traditional medicine in providing healthcare, especially in areas with limited access to formal health services. In Brazil, the National Policy on Integrative and Complementary Practices promotes the organic cultivation of medicinal plants and the integration of traditional knowledge into primary healthcare services (BRASIL, 2006a). In recent decades, studies in ethnobotany and ethnopharmacology have increasingly valued traditional knowledge about medicinal plants, integrating it with scientific knowledge. However, Afro-Brazilian religious communities (terreiros) are still not adequately recognized as spaces of care and healing. As sites for the preservation of African-based religions and as welcoming spaces for historically marginalized groups, it is essential to promote actions that recover, value, and destigmatize their therapeutic knowledge (OLIVEIRA, 2002). In this context, the Ewé Collective was founded in 2021 and has been holding biweekly meetings in a hybrid format (in-person and virtual) at FIOCRUZ in Rio de Janeiro. Its goal is to foster learning and sharing about the use of medicinal plants in both traditional and scientific medicine among researchers, public managers, community leaders, Babalorixás, Yalorixás, and other interested individuals. The collective promotes dialogue between the traditional knowledge practiced in terreiros and the scientific knowledge applied by the Brazilian Unified Health System (SUS). Ewé organizes lectures, debates, and gatherings focused on traditional knowledge, medicinal plants, and health, emphasizing popular wisdom and promoting the exchange of ancestral knowledge to strengthen natural care practices for health and well-being. The Ewé Collective currently has 61 members, 44 of whom are practitioners of Afro-Brazilian religions such as Candomblé and Umbanda. The group includes 12 religious leaders, 5 community leaders, 3 environmental educators, 6 researchers, and 3 health professionals. The meetings began as a study group on plants used in Afro-Brazilian religions, covering scientific, popular, and ceremonial names, as well as cultural, medicinal, economic, and environmental aspects. With the expansion of public activities, such as healing circles, gatherings, and collective work efforts, the group adopted the name collective. As the meetings evolved, beyond structured studies, members began sharing practical experiences such as the preparation of tinctures, teas, foot soaks, syrups, ointments, and more. Initially coordinated by a small leadership team, the meetings gradually shifted to active participation by members, many of whom presented studies and shared traditional practices. This experience inspired several participants to continue their studies, including in postgraduate programs. Ethnobotany in this context reveals the Afro-descendant identity resistance by connecting traditional knowledge from Yoruba, Fon, and Bantu peoples to ancestral plant practices (BENISTE, 2000; CARNEY, 2001; GOMES, 2009; PESSOA DE BARROS, 2000; VERGER, 1996). In May 2025, the collective established a coordination structure composed of a general coordinator, event coordinator, social media coordinator, communication coordinator, and documentation coordinator. The Ewé Collective meetings have generated an up-to-date database of knowledge and practices, contributing to IdeiaSUS, a collaborative platform that gathers numerous experiences based on ancestral health practices using medicinal plants (www.ideiasus.fiocruz.br). This dissemination facilitates the reapplication of intangible cultural heritage and fosters the creation of innovative health solutions to be incorporated into SUS across different territories in Brazil. As an resultado, the Ewé Collective works to gain recognition for traditional knowledge and popular medical practices within terreiros, utilizing plants as a form of integrative and complementary healthcare. The group is part of broader struggles and mobilizations within traditional communities. It addresses the challenge of advocating for the decolonization of power, knowledge, and being, by engaging with the complex systems that underpin traditional healing practices (FANON, 2005; FRANCO, 2011; MALDONADO-TORRES, 2016; MIGNOLO, 2008, 2017; QUIJANO, 2005, 2007; SANTOS, 2009; TAVARES, 2009). The collectives meetings highlight the importance of ethnobotany as a field of knowledge concerned with plant use by different cultures. The knowledge surrounding the use of leaves for promoção da saúde and religious practice by Afro-descendant communities offers valuable insights rooted in knowledge exchange. The Ewé Collective also serves as the foundation for the \"Plantando Saúde\" (Planting Health) project, coordinated by Fiocruz. The project promotes food sovereignty and security through the establishment of community gardens and promoção da saúde workshops in 16 traditional communities, including 3 quilombos, 3 Umbanda houses, 9 Candomblé houses, and 1 Ifá temple. It aims to foster sustainability in these territories and affirm the universality of the SUS. Some of these communities, such as Morro do Salgueiro, Quilombo AQUILAH, Hunpame Mahi Kwe Naiye, and Ilé Omi Ojuaro, are engaged in joint actions with the SUS. However, scaling this strategy remains a major challenge for the collective. The Ewé Collective will host the 3rd Meeting on Traditional Knowledge, Medicinal Plants, and Health in November 2025 and will expand documentation of its activities through IdeiaSUS. Despite being embedded within a renowned science and saúde pública institution, the Ewé Collective still faces significant legal barriers favoring the pharmaceutical industry over the advancement of traditional health practices. It is essential to promote exchange between different healthcare systems and to recognize traditional healers and the popular medicines practiced by various Afro-diasporic and Indigenous ethno-social groups. There is an urgent need for greater acadêmico engagement with these practices and the creation of a legal framework to support the incorporation of traditional complementary health practices into services offered by the SUS.",

    "abstract": "While conventional biomedicine excels at managing acute conditions, it often falls short in addressing the complex, interconnected challenges posed by aging populations and rising chronic disease. Fragmented, organ-specific models tend to suppress symptoms rather than resolve root causes or restore whole-system regulation. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), by contrast, embraces a holistic, person-centered framework that interprets symptoms as signs of systemic imbalance. Integrating biomedicine's strengths with TCMs systems-based understanding enables a more comprehensive, sustainable approachprioritizing prevenção, self-care, and non-pharmacological therapies. Founded in 1993 by Dr. Ka-Kit Hui, the UCLA Center for East-West Medicine (the Center) institutionalized this integrative model within UCLA Health, one of the top acadêmico medical centers in the United States. Its mission is to provide safe, effective, affordable, and accessible care to address persistent gaps in modern healthcare with the East-West model. Inspired by TCM masters and integrative medicine pioneers in China, Dr. Huis vision of building this model has shaped his whole career development at UCLA. He launched the Centers clinical and educational programs through external grants and part-time staff, despite not having a dedicated facility and institutional financial support. Today, all clinical faculty are fellowship-trained at the Center with many are even former students and residents of the Center's education programs. 1. Institutional and Regulatory Barriers In the early 1990s, integrative medicineincluding TCMwas widely regarded as quackery within acadêmico health centers. Acupuncture, in particular, faced regulatory ambiguity and skepticism. To address this, Dr. Hui strategically began with the more widely accepted application of acupuntura for dor crônica management, an area where biomedicine was not as effective in managing. By combining acupuntura with trigger point injections, Dr. Hui introduced a practical and legally defensible approach. Guided by TCM theory, trigger point techniques were used to treat myofascial dysfunction due to the overlap in location of many acupuntura points and trigger points. This allowed physicians to bill insurance for trigger point services even when acupuntura coverage was limited. This approach quickly gained support from referring providers and university administrators. 2. Workforce Development At the time, few US biomedically-trained practitioners were familiar with both Eastern and Western medical paradigms. To fill this gap, the Center initially brought in experienced clinicians from China and simultaneously developed interdisciplinary training programs. These early investments laid the groundwork for a mission-aligned team and ensured the long-term sustainability of the East-West model. The success of the Centers clinical program is closely tied to its educational pipeline. The faculty and many of its referring physicians are former trainees who continue to carry the Centers integrative vision forward within the UCLA system. East-West Model Outcomes The Center demonstrates how a person-centered, integrative model can thrive within an acadêmico health system. Its clinical program includes integrative consultations, East-West atenção primária, and specialty services across four outpatient clinics and two hospital-based sites. A multidisciplinary teamincluding 22 clinical faculty, 10 acupuncturists, and support staffmanages nearly 40,000 patient visits annually. The Center receives over 500 annual referrals from UCLA Health, often for complex or refractory conditions. Many referring physicians and their families eventually become patients themselvesreflecting trust in the models value. Most patients are non-Asian and receive personalized, multimodal care plans grounded in whole-person evaluations. The model integrates non-pharmacological therapies (e.g., acupuntura-like stimulation, manual terapia, mind-body practices) with preventive care, education, as well as constitution-based lifestyle and dietary guidance. It has shown efetividade in treating cancer-related symptoms, ENT disorders, mental health conditions, allergies, immune dysfunction, and long-COVID. Research confirms its segurança, efficacy, and cost-efficiency. Educational Innovation and Community Engagement Education has been central to the Centers mission. Programs include medical school electives, residency rotations, a formal fellowship, and continuing education, cultivating a network of integrative-minded clinicians within UCLA Health. Public and patient education are equally important. The Center produces multilingual self-care materials and hosts community workshops to promote health literacy. A key partnership with the Chinatown Service Center has expanded access to underserved populations through culturally responsive, community-based clinics that also function as training and research sites focused on Asian American health disparities. Lessons and Key Strategies for Success The Centers success in implementing and sustaining the East-West integrative model within a major biomedical institution stems from several strategically aligned factors. First, the model is clinically effective, addressing persistent challenges like dor crônica through therapies grounded in both TCM and biomedicine. Second, it is scientifically validated, with growing evidence supporting the mechanisms and efficacy of intervençãos such as acupuntura and trigger point terapia. Third, the Center ensured legal alignment by framing overlapping practices like acupuntura and trigger point terapia within accepted biomedical language, allowing their implementation under conventional regulatory frameworks while guided by TCM theoryminimizing risk and enhancing legitimacy. Fourth, the model is financially sustainable through the use of reimbursable therapies, supporting clinic operations and improving access. Finally, it has gained social acceptance through demonstrated resultados and peer-reviewed research, earning trust from both the public and the medical community. Together, these interlocking strategies enabled the Center to institutionalize an integrative, culturally informed model that is scientifically credible, operationally viable, and adaptable across diverse healthcare settings. The Centers three-decade journey illustrates how a thoughtful, patient-centered integrative model can not only coexist with but thrive within a dominant biomedical system. By emphasizing prevenção, self-care, and non-pharmacological therapies, the Center has demonstrated that traditional and modern medical systems can be harmonized to address todays pressing health challenges. While significant progress has been made at UCLA, access to integrative services remains limited, and continued efforts are needed to expand reach and equity. The Centers evolving experience provides practical insights and a replicable blueprint for healthcare systems worldwide seeking to implement holistic, sustainable, and culturally responsive care. We hope these efforts will contribute to the global movement toward person-centered, integrative health strategies that prioritize wellness, equity, and long-term system resilience. The Centers model of integrative atenção primária, as discussed in another abstract regarding the Centers collaboration with the Shanghai branch of the Chinese Association of Integrative Medicine, offers a compelling and scalable framework for healthcare transformation.",

    "abstract": "Since October 2024, the Fazenda do Rio Tavares Health Center (CSFRT) in Florianópolis has been offering Anthroposophic Artistic Therapy, one of the Integrative and Complementary Health Practices (PICS), recognized as an application of Anthroposophy in the field of health. This initiative is the result of a partnership between the Florianópolis School of Public Health, part of the citys municipal administration, and the Sagres Association. Through this partnership, supervised interns from the Teaching and Social Outpatient Clinic of the Sagres School of Anthroposophic Artistic Therapy provide care to patients referred by the CSFRT health team. The project also receives essential financial support from the Mahle Institute, which enables the purchase of materials and provides scholarships for Sagres participants, making this important social initiative possible. For over 20 years, the Teaching and Social Outpatient Clinic in Anthroposophic Artistic Therapy (ADSTAAS) has offered therapeutic care focused on patients well-being, intern training, and research. The clinic supports the Sagres School and contributes to saúde pública through the National Policy on Integrative and Complementary Health Practices (PNPICS), expanding access to anthroposophic therapies within Brazils public healthcare system (SUS). Implement the Anthroposophic Artistic Therapy in Primary Health Care in Florianópolis/SC - Brazil The most experienced interns, supervised by a coordinator, form the therapeutic team. The team works closely with the CSFRT health staff, including referrals from physicians and other professionals. Therapy sessions are held on Fridays, with two group options available: Group 1: 8:00 AM to 9:15 AM Group 2: 9:45 AM to 11:00 AM Each group consists of up to four patients, but the tratamento is individualizedeach patient follows a personal therapeutic path, even within a group setting. The terapia begins with free artistic expression, allowing patients to engage in creative activities. These artworks, together with the anamnesis and clinical observations, help the therapists build an initial diagnostic image, which then guides the therapeutic plan. Artistic techniquessuch as drawing, painting, and modelingare used to observe and influence health conditions, in accordance with the principles of Anthroposophic Medicine. During the process, patients begin to connect with their inner life forces, feelings, and thoughts, engaging with lifes challengessuch as illness or personal difficultiesthrough artistic expression. With the guidance of the intern therapist, patients are encouraged to respond to these challenges creatively. Over time, they develop the ability to use their formative forces more consciously and purposefully, aligning their actions with their individual essence and life purpose. Therapeutic tasks are tailored to each patients needs, seeking to harmonize the human beings inner constituents. As the artistic process evolves, improvements in the initial complaints are observed, and new therapeutic goals may emerge. The highest of these is to support the patients journey of self-discovery and self-healing, fostering personal development that benefits both the individual and the community. To support this process, patients are asked to rate their level of discomfort or difficulty using a subjective scale at the beginning of terapia. This is reassessed throughout the tratamento, including at the point of discharge. The project employs a methodology based on the seven life processes, developed by therapist Mariane Altmaier. The evolution of the terapia is continuously monitored, considering the processual forces present in artistic expression, the patients intentions, and the therapists perceptions. Evaluations are conducted at two levels: Weekly, between supervisor and interns Monthly, among the supervisor, clinic coordinator, and project manager This ongoing process of observation, evaluation, and guidance ensures that the terapia remains aligned with each patients individual healing journey and therapeutic goals. Strengthen intersectoral and institutional coordination to ensure the sustainability of the project. Given the positive impact observed in the comprehensive care of patients and in the training of interns, it is recommended to consolidate and expand the integration among the various stakeholders involved  the Municipal Health Department, the Sagres Association, the Mahle Institute, and the Primary Health Care teams. This includes ensuring ongoing funding, continuous training for the teams, and the expansion of services to other units within the atenção primária network, thus promoting equity in access to Integrative and Complementary Health Practices.",

    "abstract": "Farol is a corporate social business launched in 2023 by RD Saúde, Brazil's largest pharmacy chain, to address persistent health inequities in urban peripheries through an integrative and community-based care model. Situated in Capão Redondo, in the South Zone of São Paulo, Farol serves the communities of Jardim Lídia and Jardim Maracáareas marked by significant social vulnerability and limited access to healthcare services. As a social impact business, Farol blends entrepreneurial strategy with a social mission: generating positive resultados for society while ensuring financial sustainability. Rather than operating solely on philanthropic resources, it adopts a hybrid funding model that reinvests profits to sustain and expand its operations. Objectives: The project seeks to: Improve access to integrative and complementary health practices for underserved populations. Develop a replicable model of community-based healthcare that combines traditional knowledge with pharmaceutical expertise. Strengthen territorial health networks in collaboration with Brazil's Unified Health System (SUS). Chronological Development: 2019: Strategic review at RD Saúdecommitment to a healthier society. 2020: Introduction of social business concepts. 20212022: Feasibility studies and concept design. 2023: Strategic definition and early community engagement. 2024: Inauguration of Casa Farol, the physical care hub; launch of services. 2025 (Q1Q2): Consolidation phase with systematic data collection and model refinement. Materials and Methods: The Farol model is structured around two main care linesmental health and dor crônica managementdelivered across four integrated axes: Traditional, Complementary and Integrative Medicine (TCIM): Includes individual and group activities like yoga, meditação, aromaterapia, phytoterapia, support groups, and educational workshops. All practices are aligned with WHO guidelines and recognized in Brazils saúde pública policy (PNPIC/SUS). Integrative Pharmacy (Núcleo Farma): Merges pharmaceutical knowledge with traditional practices. Services include guidance on medicinal plants, over-the-counter medications, self-care tools (teas, foot baths), and development of in-pharmacy protocols integrating TCIM. Community Engagement and Social Activation: Builds trust through listening circles, school and health unit partnerships, and community leadership workshops. The strategy promotes social mobilization and knowledge exchange between traditional knowledge holders and health professionals. Individual Care Journey: Offers initial assessment, clinical evaluation by a multidisciplinary team, personalized care plans, and periodic follow-ups. Patients are then encouraged to transition into group-based activities and community health initiatives. Participants: The multidisciplinary team comprises naturopaths, social workers, pharmacists, nurses, and health educators. Services are implemented in partnership with Associação Monte Azul and local SUS professionals. The primary population served includes women, caregivers, and community leaders from target territories. Key Desafios Addressed: Lack of access to mental healthcare in peripheral areas High prevalence of dor crônica with insufficient tratamento options Fragmentation between traditional community practices and formal health systems Low public investment in promoção da saúde and disease prevenção Structural barriers to adopting healthier lifestyles Regulatory and cultural challenges in public-private partnerships Outcomes (as of Q2 2025): Quantitative Results: 3,211 participations in open group activities, directly benefiting 2,648 individuals 210 personalized care plans initiated, with a 75% adherence rate Net Promoter Score (NPS): 97 Satisfaction: average score of 9.8/10 General activity occupancy: 54% 65% of participants reported improved qualidade de vida (QoL) 83% of participants reported improved resultados in mental health and/or pain management Qualitative Evidence: Spontaneous testimonials describing life before and after Farol User retention driven by community word-of-mouth Strengthened territorial care networks and local empowerment Recognition as a technical reference in integrative health at the local level Innovation Outcomes: Establishment of the Núcleo Farma as a bridge between corporate pharmaceutical expertise and grassroots health innovation Development of a digital and physical community-based health record system (prontuário) Creation of a scalable public-private partnership model for TCIM in low-income areas Integration of low-cost, high-impact self-care tools (e.g., aromaterapia kits, teas) Ongoing design of national scaling strategies via Farol LAB Lessons Learned: Long-term, trust-based community partnerships are essential Users often seek care for a problem but remain for the opportunity to promote well-being Corporate social ventures can enable systemic innovation in saúde pública Preventive care and low-tech intervençãos can produce significant health impacts Cultural adaptation of TCIM boosts both efetividade and adherence Build early and transparent alliances with community actors Train multidisciplinary teams to integrate conventional and traditional knowledge Establish formal collaborations with saúde pública authorities (e.g., MoUs with SUS) Document and share protocols to facilitate replication Combine quantitative metrics with narrative-based evaluations Avoid reliance on donationsallocate product revenue for sustainability (e.g., 2% from NATZ brand) Scale model to other urban areas through Farol LAB initiative Develop national training programs in integrative, community-based health Advocate for broader TCIM inclusion in corporate social responsibility agendas Integrate digital tools and AI to support service monitoring and promoção da saúde Sustainability Strategy: Hybrid financing model combining 1% of RD Saúdes annual net profit with 2% of NATZ product revenue Leverage RD Saúdes pharmacy network for infrastructure and logistics Alignment with national health policies recognizing integrative practices Progressive community ownership and capacity-building mechanisms",

    "abstract": "The Center for East-West Medicine (CEWM) was founded in December 1993 as one of the first acadêmico integrative medicine centers in the United States. CEWM has established a person-centered integrative East-West model of care with an emphasis on wellness promotion, disease prevenção, tratamento, and rehabilitation within UCLA Health. With this model, CEWM provides comprehensive clinical services, including consultative care, atenção primária and inpatient consultative care. In addition to serving close to 40,000 patient visits annually through our four clinics and inpatient consult service, our contribution to the UCLA Health System also includes training clinicians in non-pharmacological and integrative medicine approaches as the first line of care in serving multiethnic patient populations. Since 1995, CEWM has been providing a comprehensive portfolio of integrative medicine courses and conferences for undergraduate students, medicine students, residents, and fellows, practicing physicians (including those from other specialties), as well as other healthcare providers. Seeing success at UCLA, CEWM has begun to apply implementation science to extend its reach into underserved communities. Since April 2021, CEWM has partnered with Chinatown Service Center (CSC), one of the largest Asian American organizations in Southern California. CSC provides a range of comprehensive services that include Social Services, Behavioral Health, Medical Services, and a Youth Center, generating 195,000 visits annually. As a successful federally qualified health center (FQHC) for more than 15 years, CSC Health serves more than 35,000 individuals annually with its demographics encompassing ~75% ethnic Chinese and ~20% Hispanic /Latino patients. Our collaboration goals are to: (1) make integrative medicine services available and accessible for its patients and clients, (2) make CSC as a medical education platform for cultural competency on Asian Americans, and (3) establish a research site for health disparities faced by underserved Chinese/Asian and Latinx immigrants. Below is an relato de experiência showcasing both near- and long-term highlights of the ongoing collaboration. While the CEWM-CSC partnership has made considerable progress, several challenges remain. Chief among them is the lack of sustainable funding and salary support for non-clinical acadêmico contributions such as teaching, curriculum development, program coordination, and community-engaged research. Despite growing demand, limited resources constrain the ability to scale innovations, evaluate impact rigorously, and retain a stable interdisciplinary workforce. Additionally, political and structural uncertainties in the healthcare and public funding landscape present ongoing risks to long-term planning. However, the integration of acadêmico medicine with community-based service delivery provides a resilient platform for advancing Medical Education: The partnership has enabled the integration of culturally responsive integrative medicine training across the UCLA David Geffen School of Medicine. Key initiatives include:  Early Authentic Clinical Experience (EACE, 20222024): A 10-month community health immersion for first-year medical students, exposing them to integrative atenção primária in a resource-limited FQHC serving Asian and Latinx populations.  Discovery Area of Concentration (2023present): A 9-month immersion for third-year medical students combining clinical rotations, health disparities research, and culturally sensitive program development in Asian American communities.  Fellowship Training and Electives (2025present): CEWM fellows and visiting trainees now rotate through the CSC integrative medicine teaching clinic to build competencies in community-based, culturally informed care. These programs not only enhance the cultural competence of future clinicians but also build a pipeline of practitioners trained to work effectively in underserved and immigrant communities. Clinical Services: Since fall 2024, UCLA Department of Medicine and CSC have established a joint clinical service agreement enabling UCLA clinicians to provide care within CSCs atenção primária infrastructure. Major accomplishments include:  Integrative Medicine Teaching Clinic: Launched in 2022, the clinic now delivers 300 visits per month using CEWMs consultative and tratamento protocols adapted to the community setting. Staffed by three integrative physicians and two licensed acupuncturists, it integrates TCM into chronic disease and functional care pathways. There are plans to further integrate East-West Medicine into CSCs new Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE).  Behavioral Health Integration: Joint grants have supported the delivery of culturally congruent, non-drug mental health services, including a music terapia program for common mental disorders. Future collaborations will involve UCLAs Center of Excellence in Maternal and Child Health to expand family- and child-centered mental health services and programming.  Dental-Oral Health Innovation: In partnership with the UCLA School of Dentistry, a CSC dentist completed advanced training in dental acupuntura and now leads East-West oral medicine integration at CSC. With completion of a Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) Teaching Health Center planning grant, plans are underway to launch a general dentistry residency with an emphasis on integrative oral health. Community Programs and Public Health Education: Beyond clinical and educational work, the partnership has developed community-facing initiatives to promote self-care and mental wellness in accessible, culturally tailored formats:  EWM Self-Care Video Series: Developed in collaboration with the LA County Department of Public Health, this 27-video series introduces baseado em evidence East-West practicesincluding Tai Chi, acupressure, and atenção plenafor dor crônica and mental health. Videos will soon be subtitled or narrated in Chinese to serve CSCs patient population.  Cyrus Tang Scholars Program: This initiative trains early-career health professionals to co-design and pilot culturally sensitive non-drug mental health intervençãos in partnership with CSC.  Healing with the Senses Festival (May 2026): Celebrating both Mental Health Awareness Month and AAPI Heritage Month, this festival will engage community members in interactive workshops based on the six sensessight, sound, touch, taste, smell, and spirit. Activities will include intergenerational storytelling, hands-on wellness demonstrations, and on-site mental health screenings, targeting a turnout of over 1,000 participants. The CEWM-CSC partnership represents a dynamic and evolving model of acadêmico-community collaboration in integrative medicine. Rooted in shared values of cultural humility, equity, and person-centered care, the partnership bridges the gap between acadêmico innovation and community need. Its impact extends across clinical services, workforce training, community promoção da saúde, and mental health equity. By aligning education, service, and implementation science, this partnership exemplifies a replicable model for translational, person-centered care in immigrant communities.",

    "abstract": "This report describes the experience of the first auriculoterapia training course developed and offered by the SUS Technical School of Health (ETSUS) in Vitória, the capital of Espírito Santo, highlighting its implementation, professional development, and monitoring of in-service intervenção projects. The Municipal Health Plan (2022-2025) provided for the offering of an Auriculoterapia Training Course, addressing the need to expand the offering of Integrative and Complementary Health Practices (PICS), aiming to reduce medicalization, strengthen knowledge of traditional Chinese medicine in primary healthcare, and raise awareness of unconventional therapeutic practices for improving qualidade de vida and well-being. The planning and development of the course project began in May 2024, after the release of an acupuntura specialist from the São Pedro Municipal Emergency Room, who joined the PICS Technical Area team of the Vitória Municipal Health Department (SEMU). The participation of the ETSUS teaching team was essential to developing the course, following the methodology based on the Continuing Health Education Policy, as well as partnering with the course development, monitoring, and evaluation. Objectives: Understand the main concepts and foundations of Auriculoterapia and its applicability in comprehensive healthcare, the anatomical structures of the ear, auricular points, and their respective body areas; the main methods of diagnosis and tratamento with Auriculoterapia; Identify the most prevalent diseases in primary healthcare that can be treated with Auriculoterapia; the application techniques of Auriculoterapia, with an emphasis on seed application; and Apply Auriculoterapia with seeds. Target audience: Healthcare workers with a higher education degree who work in Primary Health Care and specialized services within the SEMUS Vitória network, mostly permanent employees, who have not participated in other Auriculoterapia courses in the last four years. Categories/areas: Physical Education, Nursing, Pharmacy, Physioterapia, Speech-Language Pathology, Medicine, Nutrition, Psychology, Dentistry, Occupational Therapy, and Residents. The curriculum was developed and organized alongside the production of theoretical materials, quizzes, discussion forums, and presentations of intervenção projects. Videos and articles available in the virtual learning environment (VLE) were selected, along with practical activities and invitations to expert facilitators. Places were made available, specifying the number of places per service, given the higher-than-expected demand. The course ran from October to December 2024, with a blended learning schedule of 60 hours, divided into 24 hours of in-person and synchronous remote classes and 36 hours of content and activities in the VLE.he content covered theoretical foundations, auricular maps, clinical case discussions, application techniques, auriculoterapia practice with seeds, theoretical and practical assessments, and the development of service intervenção projects. These projects were developed by participants (individually or in groups) and analyzed by the PICS technical team and pedagogical coordinators. The estimated costs were: facilitator bonuses; materials for auriculoterapia practice, totaling U$732,60. Increased demand for auriculoterapia services from healthcare professionals and the general public; Need for certified professionals to practice auriculoterapia in the Unified Health System (SUS) in Vitória. Since 2018, the Ministry of Health and the State Health Department have not included Vitória in the offering of auriculoterapia courses. Twenty-three intervenção projects were developed, and 93.5% of those enrolled received certification. Learning assessment was: 1. Procedural, using strategies jointly defined with the facilitators, including observation and monitoring in the VLE; 2. Assessment of auriculoterapia practice with facilitator observation conducted at the end of the course, using the evaluation form developed by the Course Coordination team; and 3. Analysis of the development of the intervenção project. Project monitoring is carried out through analysis of electronic medical records, community of practice reports, and in-service technical visits. The municipality of Vitória has its own legislation for implementing PICS in the Unified Health System (SUS), established in 2016. Currently, it offers PICS in 100% of its atenção primária services and specialized care referral centers, including: fitoterapia, therapeutic gardens, acupuntura, homeopatia, yoga, reiki, auriculoterapia, meditação, music terapia, and art terapia. In addition to the course offering, other educational materials and technical notes on recommendations for implementing auriculoterapia were developed, as well as a monitoring guide for technical visits. The 2nd Edition of the Auriculoterapia Course is scheduled to be offered in September 2025 to meet the pent-up demand of professionals who could not be included in the programs.",

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT Recent diagnostic criteria for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) have included sensory sensitivities as a core diagnostic feature due to difficulties in social integration. Since the five senses capture stimuli and decode them into electromagnetic impulses, could atypical sensory experiences exhibit an easily observable electromagnetic pattern How could we measure it (Robertson, 2017) With the need for an automated method to support early diagnosis of ASD recognized by regulatory bodies, the electromagnetic measurement technologies Bioelectrography and Ryodoraku, which use Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) reasoning as bioenergetic markers, become current and relevant in our society, as the literature reveals their potential to provide diagnostic and screening tools in medical biometrics. (Lo, 2012; Sankhala, 2020; Kostyuk, 2010; Kostyuk, 2011; Korotkov, 2019; Certificate No.: 250817, 2024). Using these two biophysical technologies in a double-verification system, this study monitored and analyzed the electromagnetic behavioral pattern of ASD in order to understand its context and processes, making its key elements evident. DESCRIPTION An empirical data collection experiment was carried out using the Ryodoraku and Bioelectrography (Bio-Well) methods on 7 autistic patients. The Ryodoraku method, recognized by ANVISA (Brazilian Health Regulatory Agency), uses an electro-conductivity measurement system performed quickly and non-invasively, with the simple touch of a probe to 24 acupuntura points located on the hands and feet. (Volpi, 2018; Lobo, 2021; Imamura, 1996; ANVISA, Registration 80191680005) The Bioelectrography (Bio-Well) method, certified by the European Community, uses a high-intensity electric field to stimulate the emission of photons and electrons at acupuntura points located on the 10 fingers, making the measurement process very similar to a quick and non-invasive fingerprint scan. (Korotkov, 2019) A total of two measurements were takenone with the Bioelectrography (Bio-Well) method and one with the Ryodoraku method. Both are fast (each lasting about 5 minutes), non-invasive, and pose no risk to the patient. Recent diagnostic criteria for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) have included sensory sensitivities as a core diagnostic feature due to difficulties in social integration. Since the five senses capture stimuli and decode them into electromagnetic impulses, could atypical sensory experiences exhibit an easily observable electromagnetic pattern How could we measure it The empirical experience with 7 autistic patients revealed, through comparison with neurotypical subjects, a clear discrepancy in the Bio-Well \"stress level\" marker. All 7 autistic patients showed high Bio-Well stress levels, while the neurotypical parents presented only slightly elevated Bio-Well stress levels. This marker deserves special attention, as literature reveals increasing awareness that oxidative stress may be involved in the pathophysiology of ASD. Blood is one of the main substrates for electron current and when functioning normally, the \"electron clouds\" are evenly distributed. In cases of imbalanced blood circulation, electron transfer to tissue is impaired and free radical reactions do not flow harmoniously. Therefore, the lack of brightness in the EPI-gram (Electrophotonic Image) is an indicator of hindered electron density transfer to body tissues and abnormal flow of free radical reactions. The Ryodoraku method revealed a widely reported syndromic pattern in the literature of excess Liver and inhibited Heart in all 7 assessed patients. According to TCM, autism-related signs and symptomssuch as anger, rage, frustration, depressão and resentment, chaotic and/or manic behavior, muscle cramps, tendon contractions, limited extension/flexion of tendons, blurred vision, tremors, and seizurescan be alleviated or controlled when Liver energy is rebalanced. The insights from empirical observation pointed to a need for further investigation and motivated the development of a project relevant to my masters acadêmico experience, aligned with research, aimed at refining methods for data collection that may contribute to the production of scientific materials on the topic.

    "abstract": "ABSTRACT: There is a need to improve the quality of obstetric care, which can be obtained with the adoption of combined strategies, such as multiprofessional care, including the physiotherapist, and contemplating the use of integrative and complementary practices, thus obtaining better resultados. DESCRIPTION: The World Health Organization recommends multidisciplinary care, as well as the use of Integrative and Complementary Practices (ICPs), in the entire pregnancy-puerperal cycle, including labor (PT), benefiting more positive resultados ¹. The Brazilian National Policy for Integrative and Complementary Practices (PNPIC) aims to implement PICS in the Unified Health System (SUS), generate adherence and monitor their use in services², at the three levels of care, including maternity hospitals and obstetric centers, for habitual and high-risk pregnant women, implemented by multiprofessional teams, and qualified to use them. The use of ICT during labor, especially Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), considering auriculoterapia and acupressure, makes the birth experience more humanized, respecting the woman's protagonism, and breaks with the traditional centered medical model, providing an integral view³. The PNPIC encourages the production of scientific evidence, training and professional qualification, in partnership with Health Higher Education Institutions (HEIs)², which form a support network for the SUS, developing extension projects, integrating teaching, care and research . Considering the above, an extension project was implemented in a municipal public maternity hospital in Rio de Janeiro, by a physiotherapist professor in women's health and undergraduate students in physioterapia from a federal HEI in Rio de Janeiro, all with training in PICS, aiming to integrate multiprofessional care for parturients during labor. The maternity hospital attends to habitual and high-risk pregnant women, and has only a few non-pharmacological analgesic strategies, often consisting of free movements and sprinkler baths, as desired by the parturient. The physiotherapeutic prescription, on the other hand, is based on the baby's height in the pelvis, dilation, labor time, degree of pain, fatigue and feelings of the parturient, considering the use of resources such as: sprinkler bath, movements and adoption of postures aligned with biomechanics, therapeutic ball and peanuts, transcutaneous electrostimulation, diaphragmatic breathing, emotional and humanized support, auriculoterapia, acupressure and reflexoterapia. However, in this relato de experiência, movement and positioning, breathing and TCM were used exclusively. TCM was used in 8 parturients aged between 22 and 39 years, 6 primiparous and 2 multiparous, with between 5 and 6 cm of uterine dilation. All of them had a baby positioned in the upper narrows of the pelvis, all reported grade 10 of pain (measured by the visual analog pain scale/VAS), all self-reported extreme fatigue, and said that they would not be able to reach the end of the delivery, requesting a cesarean section. Breathing, positions and movements guided by a physiotherapist were offered, combined with the use of acupoints in the sacroiliac for pain and also to assist in the induction of uterine contraction (BL31 and BL32). Regarding auriculoterapia, common points were used, such as: Shen men, Uterus, Cervix, Hypothalamus, Pituitary, Kidney, Liver and Neurasthenia, as well as points according to individual needs. To increase the quality of multidisciplinary care for parturients, providing strategies that favor progressive uterine contractions and descent of the baby during delivery, as well as the control of pain and fatigue and reduction of negative emotions, such as ansiedade and fear. The combination of negative factors can increase the cycle of pain and muscle tension, with repercussions on the extension of labor time, leading to resultados such as cesarean section . Considering the time elapsed from the beginning of care to the expulsive period, among 5 primiparous women, there was a variation between 3 and 4 hours, and among multiparous women, a variation between 1 hour and 3 hours. In all of them, there was a report of reduced pain, fatigue and ansiedade, as well as improved self-confidence to reach the expulsive moment, in addition to the report of satisfaction. It was perceived that the use of TCM, combined with movements and positions, from the physiotherapist's perspective, favored the establishment of rhythm in regular and progressive uterine contractions, as well as reassured the parturients. Among primiparous women, there was one in which the beginning of care occurred late, with more than 18 hours of labor, difficulties in establishing rhythmic contractions, and extreme fatigue, pain, and ansiedade. During the consultation, dilation progressed up to 9 cm, with rhythmic contractions. However, due to the end of the shift, the team had to leave, ceasing the physiotherapeutic exercises, with a stop in progression and evolution to cesarean section. To humanize and qualify multiprofessional care for parturients, reducing unnecessary intervençãos and cesarean sections, in addition to maternal mortality, through the use of light, low-cost, easy-to-apply technologies, and results already evident in the literature. For this, it is relevant to improve professional training and qualification, which will reflect on care practices and maternal resultados. In this sense, health education and care practice should consider strategies to obtain better obstetric results, such as multiprofessional care, including physical therapists, and the use of light and woman-centered technologies, such as TCM.",

    "abstract": "The municipality of Santo Antônio do Iça is located in the Brazilian Amazon, in the northern region of the country, in the state of Amazonas. It is 879 km from the capital, Manaus, and belongs to the Upper Solimões Microregion and Southwest Amazon Mesoregion. Santo Antônio do Iça has an area of 12,366.14 km², a population of 28,211, and a population density of 2.28 inhabitants/km², according to the latest demographic census (IBGE, 2022). The Human Development Index (HDI) of the municipality of Santo Antônio do Içá is low (0.533), meaning the municipality has lower life expectancy, income, and access to education and healthcare compared to other municipalities in Brazil, particularly Manaus, which has a high HDI. Another important index for analyzing the municipality is the Social Progress Index (SPI), which assesses the population's qualidade de vida. On a scale of 0 to 100, the SPI encompasses dimensions of human needs, the foundations of well-being, and opportunities. The municipality's 2025 SPI is 50.34, or average. The health system of the municipality is part of the Health Region Alto Solimões. According to the National Register of Health Establishments (CNES) of the municipality, the Municipal Health System is composed of 15 health facilities, all belonging to atenção primária and some emergencies, with more severe cases being referred to Manaus or larger cities in the region. This study presented the health territory of one of these facilities, the Santo Antônio do Içá Health Center  located in the downtown neighborhood of Santo Antônio do Içá. The health territory in question is served by the \"Beija Flor\" Family Health Team, responsible for serving 2,584 active citizens. The student in question is the physician at the Beija Flor Family Health Strategy (ESF). In addition to the physician in charge, the team includes thirteen professionals, primarily Community Health Agents (CHAs), totaling fourteen professionals, as well as nursing technicians and nurses. In general, the daily work of this team is disjointed and, above all, lacking strategic planning. This lack of planning is primarily due to the lack of data on the health territory to develop strategies for health actions, in addition to the disuse of existing resources for this purpose. To clarify this context, we highlight the situation of children within the territory covered by the Beija Flor Family Health Strategy (ESF). In this case, it is unknown how many children were born in the last month and, consequently, there is no planning for developing a schedule for monitoring childcare and postpartum care. Therefore, Community Health Agents (CHAs) are not directed to collect data, and when they do provide it, it is not used. The consequences of this situation are catastrophic, given its impact on patient recordswhich are mostly incomplete, lacking patient address and contact informationand, most importantly, on atenção primária planning in the health territory covered by the Beija Flor Family Health Strategy (ESF). The lack of reliable monitoring of indicators, especially for riverside and Indigenous communities, results in health inequities, such as acute cases of gastroenteritis, flu-like illnesses, and other infectious diseases. In addition to these morbidities, the community suffers from chronic diseases such as hypertension and rheumatological syndromes, especially lumbosciatic pain, which in many cases are not monitored by the team, lacking intelligent, interdisciplinary strategies to address the issues at hand. This relato de experiência recommends developing a visit calendar based on mapping the micro-areas covered by Community Health Agents (CHAs). This mapping is essential to provide visibility to populations that are not yet adequately monitored in health territories, especially those located in the region. Developing a well-structured calendar can significantly contribute to preventing preventable morbidities and deaths, strengthening Primary Care indicators in the municipality of Santo Antônio do Içá. Despite the relevance of this proposal, its implementation faces significant challenges, primarily related to logistics, the availability of technological equipment, and the lack of qualified human resources to effectively map and operationalize the calendar. Even so, overcoming these obstacles is essential to ensuring greater equity in access to services and strengthening the Family Health Strategy's role in vulnerable areas.",

    "abstract": "Ilha de Maré, located in the Bay of All Saints, is home to a predominantly Quilombola population that historically traces its roots to Afro-Brazilian slaves. The island is vulnerable to the environmental impacts of industrialization, especially air pollution, rising temperatures, and increasing frequency of heat waves, which exacerbate pre-existing health challenges. The local population faces significant socioeconomic inequalities and limited access to healthcare services. These vulnerabilities make the community an ideal context for the implementation of an interdisciplinary planetary health approach. The initiative was developed by medical students through a partnership between the PlanetAR Project and the local community. Over a three-day period, students interacted with residents, local workers, and healthcare professionals, immersing themselves in the daily realities of life on the island. The educational model involved various stakeholders, including public school students and healthcare professionals. Workshops were held to educate participants on the health impacts of air pollution and heat waves, while also discussing solutions and adaptation strategies in a practical context. Methods The educational strategy employed a combination of workshops aimed at different segments of the community: school students and healthcare professionals. These workshops were tailored to the specific needs and understanding levels of each group. 1. Workshops with School Students: The sessions were designed to be interactive and engaging, using playful and visual materials to help young students understand the link between climate change and health. Topics such as air pollution and heat waves were presented through games, drawings, and role-playing activities, allowing students to express their concerns and ideas creatively. These workshops fostered awareness and promoted a sense of empowerment among students to advocate for environmental and health improvements in their community. 2. Workshops with Healthcare Professionals: The sessions for healthcare workers focused on the practical impacts of air pollution and heat waves on health. Students worked alongside professionals to discuss the specific challenges of managing patients during extreme heat events. Topics included adjusting medication doses during heatwaves, managing dehydration, and the use of protective equipment for vulnerable patients. These workshops aimed to enhance the capacity of local healthcare providers to respond to climate-related health emergencies. 3. Community Involvement: One of the core elements of this experience was the integration of the community throughout the process. Residents were encouraged to participate in the workshops, share their personal experiences, and provide valuable insights into how local healthcare systems could be better prepared for climate-related health risks. This helped students see the practical application of their knowledge in a real-world context and fostered a sense of shared responsibility. The primary issues addressed by the students were the health risks posed by air pollution, heat waves, and other climate-related phenomena that disproportionately affect marginalized communities, such as those living on Ilha de Maré. These issues are compounded by the area's industrial activities, inadequate access to health services, and a lack of awareness among residents about how climate change impacts health. 1. Air Pollution: The community is exposed to high levels of air pollution due to nearby industrial activities, which contribute to respiratory diseases and other health problems. 2. Heat Waves: The increasing frequency of heatwaves exacerbates cardiovascular and respiratory conditions, particularly among vulnerable populations such as the elderly, children, and people with pre-existing health conditions. 3. Climate Change: The broader impacts of climate change, including sea level rise and extreme weather events, further threaten the health and livelihoods of residents on the island. The medical students role was to raise awareness about these issues, create spaces for dialogue, and propose practical solutions, particularly in the context of healthcare adaptations to mitigate the health impacts of climate change. The workshops had a significant impact on the local community and medical students alike. Some of the key resultados included: 1. Enhanced Awareness: There was a notable increase in awareness among school students and healthcare professionals about the health risks posed by air pollution and heat waves. Students were able to articulate the relationship between these environmental factors and specific health conditions such as asthma, respiratory infections, and heatstroke. 2. Development of Mitigation Strategies: Medical students presented strategies to reduce health risks associated with climate change, including recommendations for saúde pública policies, community-based adaptations, and individual protective measures. 3. Knowledge Exchange: The workshops provided an opportunity for knowledge exchange between students and local healthcare professionals. This collaboration enhanced the capacity of healthcare workers to handle climate-related health challenges, such as adjusting medication doses for patients during heatwaves. 4. Empowered Local Community: Residents expressed increased confidence in managing their health in the face of environmental challenges, and many indicated a desire to continue participating in climate-related health initiatives. Based on the experience of this immersive educational project, several recommendations were made for both future medical education and community engagement in climate health: 1. Integrating Planetary Health into Medical Education: It is essential to integrate planetary health principles into medical curricula, enabling students to develop a comprehensive understanding of the complex relationships between human health, the environment, and climate change. 2. Strengthening Community Involvement: Future projects should continue to prioritize community engagement, ensuring that local residents are not only recipients of information but active participants in identifying and implementing solutions. 3. Expanding Educational Approaches: The combination of theoretical and practical workshops is effective, but future initiatives could benefit from expanding into other areas of healthcare, such as mental health impacts of climate change, waterborne diseases, and vector-borne diseases related to climate shifts. 4. Policy Advocacy: Medical students and healthcare professionals should be encouraged to advocate for public policies that address climate change as a determinant of health. This could include better regulation of pollution, improving healthcare infrastructure to handle climate-related emergencies, and promoting health equity. This report summarizes the practical and educational efforts undertaken by medical students to address climate change impacts on health in a Quilombola community in Brazil. The resultados highlighted the importance of community-based learning and interdisciplinary education in addressing the global challenge of climate change.",

    "abstract": "Naturology, undergraduate degree in the health field since 1998, operates with a comprehensive approach to care, considering the physical, emotional, mental, spiritual, sociocultural, and environmental dimensions of the human being. Based on promoção da saúde, disease prevenção, and education for self-care, it utilizes integrative and complementary practices (PICS), therapeutic dynamics, interactive process, and group processes, encouraging individual empowerment and autonomy. The health hebiatric care is based on the naturopathy ethics manual, on the guidelines of the adolescent health program, aligned with the peinciples of the adolescent statute (ECA). Since 2006, Naturology has been part of the Adolescent Health Program (PROSAD), and since October 2024, the Naturology Unit has become part of its team. PROSAD is a public policy initiative of the state of São Paulo, internationally recognized, that offers comprehensive and transdisciplinary care to young people aged 10 to 20. Coordinated by Dr. Albertina Duarte Takiuti, the program includes 21 units (Adolescent Houses), four of which have naturologists on staff, reaffirming the role of Naturology as a driver of social transformation and promoter of equity in youth care. The Naturology Unit voluntarily integrates multidisciplinary teams within the program, conducting activities in waiting rooms such as discussion circles on integrative health, art terapia dynamics, collective efforts to grow medicinal gardens at the Adolescent Houses, cultural and health events like open mic sessions (Sarau), and both individual and group consultationsall grounded in naturological principles. Each space experiences its own uniqueness and challenges in welcoming young people. Although the Houses operate in different contexts, they are all centered on adolescence and the specificities of the many processes they embrace. The Naturology Units work at the Womens Outpatient Clinic of the Clinical Hospital (HC) and at the Pinheiros Adolescent House integrates knowledge of natural gynecology and obstetrics into the multidisciplinary teams focused on gynecology and womens health. In Pinheiros, the team also offers individual consultations in adolescent naturology, self-care workshops, and health dialogue circles in the waiting areas. The MBoi Mirim Adolescent House offers socio-educational activities to the community, including individual consultations, health education circles, and art terapia dynamics. The Taboão da Serra Adolescent House provides consultations and workshops aimed at promoção da saúde. Within Brazils Unified Health System (SUS), the activities developed by the Naturology Unit contribute to the incorporation of integrative practices into saúde pública frameworks, fostering empowerment and autonomy among adolescents, naturologists, and multiprofessional teams in adolescent healthcare. Over the years, an average of 2,710 individual sessions and 722 group sessions were conducted. Both adolescents and professionals observed improvements in self-awareness, emotional and social perception, strengthened autonomy, and emotional intelligence. There was also a significant increase in engagement in self-care activities, conflict resolution, and group integration. The adolescents were successfully welcomed and supported, and the professionals contributed to reducing the impact of risk factors on their health The initially proposed objectives were achieved, with emphasis on strengthening adolescents autonomy, self-care, and social integration. Naturological practices demonstrated a positive impact on emotional and relational aspects, validating the proposal of person-centered integral care. It is recommended to continue and expand the actions developed, with emphasis on individual consultations, self-care workshops, dialogue circles, and group-based integrative practices. Interprofessional collaboration and active listening should remain essential foundations of the approach. Practical suggestions could be expand team training in Integrative and Complementary Health Practices (PICS); foster intersectoral partnerships; and implement continuous evaluation tools focused on the subjective impacts of the intervençãos. Finally, it is suggested to replicate the experience in other regions, develop specific clinical protocols for naturological care in adolescence, and encourage scientific research on the effects of these practices within the context of saúde pública.",

    "abstract": "This report concerns about the experience that began in 1987 at the Associação Fazenda Renascer Therapeutic Community, located in the Metropolitan Region of Belo Horizonte, capital of the State of Minas Gerais, in Brazil. The \"Therapeutic Community\" methodology involves medical tratamento for the care and assistance of drug users in general, through the exclusively voluntary hospitalization of those dependent on alcohol and other drugs in a protected environment with technical assistance. The goal of this report is to present the contribution of dynamized homeopathic and anthroposophic medicines to the paradigm shift in the tratamento and recovery of drug addicts, based on their reports and those of their families, as well as to contribute to an improvement in the therapeutic efficacy of tratamento for drug addicts with integrative and complementary health technology. Drug abuse is currently the greatest challenge facing saúde pública, as well as the biggest mental health, family breakdown, public segurança, and criminal policy problem in our state. Hence the relevance of this topic. This report addresses the technologies tested over years of experience in seeking help for those suffering from the pathology generated by chemical dependency in users, their families and the community in general. Over the last four decades of experience in clinical observation, the use of homeopathic and anthroposophic medicines in tratamento has made important contributions to mitigating the problem. The use of non-conventional medications, due to their proven efetividade and low cost, means that in the cost/benefit ratio, the integrative and complementary health approach can be a catalytic instrument in the construction of effective, efficient and viable technologies for reducing the harm caused by the challenge of illness of will, in the choices made by each individual. As a chronic, incurable, progressive, and fatal pathology, without intervenção in the natural history of the disease, measuring results is like counting grains of sand in the desert or at the seashore: when we believe that the grains will be able to fill the void of statistics, they vanish through our fingers. Therefore, results are measurable through the testimony of those who, over the years, have been building their liberation from the slavery of chemical dependency, testimonies that include the benefits of using homeopathic and anthroposophic medications in this regard. Patients and family members testify to their experiences and struggles in the challenge of overcoming illness through their willpower, and the support they receive from using non-conventional medications. To encourage the deepening and improvement of therapeutic techniques, including medication, by the Unified Health System (SUS) of Brazil through the RAPS (Psychosocial Attention Network), to reduce harm to those dependent on alcohol and other drugs, both legal and illegal.",

    "abstract": "Living with dermatological lesions, especially wounds, can lead to significant changes in an individual's life (BEDIN et al. 2014). Therefore, the demands of this population are multidimensional, requiring a holistic approach from professionals providing care. The literature points to the positive effects of Integrative Health Practices (IHPs) on health conditions frequently identified among people with wounds, such as pain, mood changes, and sleep patterns. In Brazil, auriculoterapia stands out among the IHPs included in the National Policy for Integrative and Complementary Practices (PNPIC) due to the greater scope of training programs and consequent greater availability within the Unified Health System (SUS). Nurses and nursing technicians, in turn, are the professional categories that most frequently care for people with wounds and their significant representation among auriculotherapists in SUS health services. Although ISPs are developed within a multidisciplinary setting, it is worth noting that, in Brazil, Nursing recognizes them as a practice that comprises its scope of practice, regulating them with corresponding training requirements (COFEN Resolution No. 739, February 5, 2024; MILDEMBERG et al. 2023). Therefore, educational institutions represent an important mediator in the process of transferring knowledge to baseado em evidence clinical practice. Thus, this study aimed to report the contributions of the Center for Chinese Medicine of the Confucius Institute of the Federal University of Goiás (UFG), linked to the Outpatient Clinic for Integrative Health Practices (PIS) of the School of Nursing (FEN) of the same institution. This program maintains, as an outreach activity, a training program for auriculotherapists. This program, exceptionally, addressed lato sensu graduate students in Dermatological Nursing with an Emphasis on Care for People with Wounds. The development of technical-scientific productions, when combined with experiential activities on the topic, is considered relevant to bridge gaps between theoretical aspects and clinical practice. This was possible for the group of graduate students who developed their final project on the effects of auriculoterapia in the therapeutic approach to people with wounds. Regarding professional practice, Resolution No. 736/2024 of the Federal Council of Nursing (COFEN) establishes guidelines for the systematization of care. Meanwhile, the organization of care in PIS (Individual Health Injury Prevention Program) poses a challenge, both to ensure equitable monitoring of individuals, with the production of indicators and respective contributions to the implementation of the PNPIC (National Health Policy), and to provide support for baseado em evidence clinical practice. Therefore, technical-scientific productions related to care in PIS (Individual Health Injury Prevention Program) are essential and need to be both operational and grounded in appropriate theoretical and philosophical frameworks. Concurrently with an integrative literature review, the group of postgraduate students underwent auriculoterapia training at the AmbPIS/Center for Chinese Medicine (TCM\\) of the Confucius Institute of UFG, with a workload corresponding to COFEN Resolution No. 739, February 5, 2024. Fundamentals of TCM and the implementation of auriculoterapia comprised one of the modules of the specialization course, and the practical component was carried out in consultations with individuals followed at AmbPIS, under the supervision of one of the therapists with extensive training and integration with the Confucius Institute of UFG. The integrative review followed the recommendations of the PRISMA Statement, using the BVS, MEDLINE-PubMed (National Library of Medicine), CINAHAL, Web of Science, and EMBASE databases. Primary studies in Portuguese, English, and Spanish, with a 10-year time frame, conducted only with humans, and describing intervençãos among people with wounds were included. Only two studies met the inclusion criteria: a pilot study conducted among women undergoing episiotomy in Croatia and a case study of a man with ulcers due to sickle cell anemia in Campinas, São Paulo, Brazil. The auriculoterapia protocols presented varied across the studies, with the exception of the \"Shen Men\" acupoint. In the study by Jai et al. (2019), three acupoints were stimulated using semi-permanent needles, while seven were stimulated in the clinical relato de casoed in the study by Benites et al. (2023). In the discussions held based on the literature and clinical practice, the following principles for implementing auriculoterapia among people with wounds are understood (JAIC et al., 2019; BENITES, et al., 2023; CHEN et al., 2025): 1-pay attention to the energy diagnosis that signals Yin and Yang deficiency, Qi and blood stagnation, spleen (earth) and kidney (water) deficiency, especially in cases of people with chronic wounds; 2-verify the relevance of stimulating acupoints that intervene in the autonomic nervous system, which reflect the physiological and psychological repercussions of the individual; 3-perform monitoring using validated scales to assess pain, qualidade de vida, sleep quality, and pruritus; 4-verify the relevance of the therapeutic goals of toning renal and splenic function. Literature data suggest that auriculoterapia and/or auricular acupuntura should be considered in the care of people with wounds, especially for pain management and its repercussions. These findings represent a starting point for developing clinical auriculoterapia protocols for the population with wounds, a context in which care is still in its infancy. The practical activities carried out at the TCM Center/AmbPIS, aligned with technical and scientific literature on the topic, contributed to the development of technical competencies, especially regarding the emphasis on clinical reasoning based on TCM principles, which distinguishes it from other known auriculoterapia training programs.",

    "abstract": "Despite scientific and technological advances in healthcare, which have significantly impacted life expectancy, there has been a growing increase in healthcare costs in Brazil and worldwide, often disproportionate to the results observed in recent years. Recent studies in public databases, such as those of the IBGE (Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics) and the WHO's International Agency for Research on Cancer, revealed that in 2012, 26.5% of all cancer cases (114,497 cases) and 33.6% of all cancer deaths in Brazil (63,371 deaths) could have been avoided by changing Brazilians' lifestyles (REZENDE et al, 2017, p. 148). Emerging evidence suggests that part of the link between psychosocial risk factors (stress, ansiedade, depressão, hostility, lack of emotional support, some personality traits, childhood adversity, and stressful life events) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) and diabetes may operate through the metabolic syndrome, a clustering of several CVD risk factors, including (i) abdominal obesity, (ii) hypertriglyceridemia, (iii) low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, (iv) hypertension, and (v) hyperglycemia.Traditional, Complementary and Integrative Medicine (TCIM) practices are being implemented in private and saúde pública care worldwide. This scenario raises the need for digital health solutions that help promote health based on education and empower patients for their self-management and self-care. This relato de experiência refers to the use of a self-assessment and self-monitoring health application offered to patients as a way to complement person-centered care and enable the production of real-world data, in a general practitioner's office in Rio de Janeiro. The online platform and mobile app have been offered to patients since 2019 and already have 787 active users. Its features include assessments, health education, and reminders for tratamento adherence. The assessment includes aspects of physical, mental, and behavioral health, using psychometric scales (stress, ansiedade, depressão, resilience, emotional intelligence, spirituality), lifestyle questionnaires, anthropometric measurements, vital signs, and laboratory tests, as well as diaries of emotions, symptoms, movement, integrative practices such as meditação, yoga, and Tai Chi, nutrition, qualidade de vida, and readiness for change. The tool's integrative approach allows for the creation of a health profile and measurement of the impact of many health intervençãos. As a digital solution, it has been used in the monitoring and follow-up of patients with hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, dor crônica, ansiedade, obesity, and other conditions, in Brazil and internationally. Maintain long-term adherence is a challenge.",

    "abstract": "The Toys and Books project was created in 2024 from the initiative of a 10-year-old boy, within the context of a school pedagogical proposal entitled Children Acting in the World. With a genuine desire to care for other childrendespite being a child himselfthe author envisioned a mobile toy and book library: a cart filled with books and toys, to be used in the pediatric oncology wards of the National Cancer Institute (INCA) in Brazil. The proposal was personally presented by the child to INCA and to the Institutes social action division (Incavoluntário), in a meeting with members of the medical team, nursing staff, occupational therapist, and hospital pedagogues. The initiative was warmly received and approved by the institution, which acknowledged its symbolic and therapeutic relevance. To formalize its continuation, a partnership agreement was established between the childs legal guardians and Incavoluntário. The cart is currently in its final stages of production, with a curated selection of books and toys appropriate to the clinical context and to the different stages of child development. The mobile toy and book library will be operated by professionals from the pediatric oncology health and education teams. The projects goal is to promote care, bonding, playfulness, comfort, and joy within the hospital environment through play and readingpractices recognized as therapeutic resources by the guidelines of Brazils National Policy on Integrative and Complementary Practices in Health (PICS/SUS) and by the World Health Organizations framework on Traditional, Complementary and Integrative Medicine (TCIM/WHO). The project operates within the context of pediatric oncology hospitalization, where physical and emotional suffering, pain, and disconnection from everyday life compromise the child's overall well-being. By bringing experiences of affection, playfulness, and attentive listening into the hospital wards, the project helps to ease fears, foster bonds, and support the re-signification of the hospital as a space for coexistence and integral care. It also addresses the ethical and cultural challenge of the invisibilization of the child as an active subject and agent of care. By enabling a child to become the protagonist of a proposal to transform the hospital environment, the project breaks paradigms and proposes a new intergenerational ethic of care. Although still in its initial implementation phase, Toys and Books has already generated significant institutional and human impacts. It has strengthened the dialogue between education and health, recognized childrens protagonism as a transformative force, and fostered the creation of a sensitive support network committed to integral care. The young author himself, upon seeing his idea welcomed by adults and transformed into concrete action, expresses feelings of belonging, empathy, and responsibility. Hospital professionals report feeling inspired and hopeful as they witness the projects development. The initiative inspires humanized practices, strengthens intergenerational bonds, and transforms the hospital into a symbolic space of citizenship, affection, and creativity. The continuity of the project will include the active participation of the author and invited guestsboth children and adultswho will help shape Toys and Books into a living play-library through ongoing activities that offer affective experiences for hospitalized children, such as meetings with authors, storytelling sessions, creative workshops, and other imaginative encounters. Paths are already emerging for replication in other institutions and greater involvement of children and schools in collective health actions. The experience reveals the transformative potential of intersectoral initiatives in which childhood, education, health, and public policy are innovatively articulated, capable of generating more efficient care networks that are sensitive to the uniqueness of childhood and aligned with the principles of Integrative and Complementary Practices (PICs), the Brazilian Unified Health System (SUS), and Traditional, Complementary and Integrative Medicine (TCIM). The main challenges include the continuous monitoring of the proposal, qualified mediation by the hospital team, systematic evaluation of its impacts, and the possibility of safe and sensitive replication in other hospital contexts. It is essential to foster an institutional culture that values listening to children as a form of care. Projects like Toys and Books go beyond assistentialism and offer sustainable and civilizing responses for the promotion of comprehensive health. They educate for care, foster citizenship, and inspire a new collective ethic for the future. Ethical Considerations: This report results from a project conceived and presented in 2024 by a 10-year-old child, with pedagogical guidance and co-authorship of health and education professionals. The proposal was formally embraced and supervised by the Brazilian National Cancer Institute (INCA) and Incavoluntário, with a partnership agreement signed by the childs legal guardians. The initiative fully respects national and international ethical principles regarding child protection, agency, and voice, ensuring family consent, confidentiality, and appropriate institutional support throughout all stages of the process.",

    "abstract": "Traditional medicine (TM) remains a primary source of healthcare for over 80% of Africas population. In 2000, the WHO Regional Office for Africa (WHO/AFRO) launched the first-ever WHO regional strategy on promoting the role of TM in national health systems to advance the TM development in its 47 Member States. This was followed by the 2013 strategy on enhancing the role of TM in health systems. These regional strategies were aligned with the African Unions (AU) Decades of African Traditional Medicine (20012010 and 20112020). This abstract presents an assessment of progress, challenges, and lessons learned from 2000 to 2023 across the WHO/AFRO Region. (a) Determine the extent of implementation of the priority intervençãos of the two strategies including plans of actions of the two decades of African TM by the countries in the region; (b) Identify the role of the WHO Regional Officed for Africa in the implementation of the strategies; (c) Identify the challenges encountered in the development, recognition or integration of TM into the national healthcare system of the countries in the African region and (d) Identify the next steps in the roadmap to the development, recognition and/or integration of TM into national healthcare systems in the region. Leadership and Governance: By 2023, 40 of the 47 countries had developed national TM policies, up from 8 in 2000. Legal frameworks for TM practice were enacted in 39 countries, compared to only one in 2000. Thirty-two countries established national expert committees on TM to oversee policy and implementation. However, only 28 countries had developed national policy implementation plans demonstrating implementation challenges policy and practice. Health Workforce and Education: Twenty-five countries integrated TM into the training curricula of health professionals, while 21 included TM in training programmes for TM practitioners. Additional countries need to integrate TM in their curricula and provide continuing education of TM to biomedical professionals to acquire and enhance knowledge on the role of TM in health systems. Research and Development and Health information System: The number of national TM research institutes grew from 18 in 2000 to 38 in 2023. The COVID-19 pandemic spurred TM research, including ensaio clínicos for fitoterapias proposed for COVID-19 Treatment or prevenção in Democratic Republic of Congo, Ghana, Madagascar, Nigeria and South Africa and Uganda. However, preclinical testing and documentation of traditional knowledge remain limited. To systematically collect data on TM and integrate it with other saúde pública priorities it must be included in HIS. Medical Products and Regulation: National pharmacopoeias and formularies were developed in several countries. Over 100 TM products and 45 for communicable diseases and noncommunicable diseases were registered and included in national essential medicines lists respectively. Nevertheless, fewer than one-third of countries had GMP-compliant production facilities. However, more clinical research as well as appropriate methodologies for TM are required for TM to produce evidence on the segurança, efficacy and quality of TM products and intervençãos. Health Service Delivery: Several countries established TM clinics within public hospitals, with Ghana having established such facilities in 55 hospitals; though only a limited number achieved full integration of TM into primary healthcare and insurance coverage. Health Financing: Most TM programmes remained reliant on external funding, with limited domestic investment. National budget allocations for TM remain inconsistent across the Region. There is need for comprehensive insurance that covers services and products in order to protect populations from financial hardships in line with UHC goals. Monitoring and Evaluation: WHO/AFRO facilitated periodic assessments through Regional Committee sessions in 2011 (Yamoussoukro), 2016 (Addis Ababa), and 2020 (Brazzaville). However, national M&E frameworks remain weak and data on TM coverage and resultados is scarce. Regulatory gaps, limited research capacity, underfunding, and uneven integration, inadequate protection of intellectual propertymust be addressed. The experience from 2000 to 2023 highlights lessons and emphasize the need to implement the following recommendations: 1. Stronger political commitment and institutional leadership. 2. Harmonized regional regulatory frameworks and protection of traditional knowledge. 3. Investment in R&D, GMP-certified production, and TM infrastructure. 4. Full integration of TM into health systems under Universal Health Coverage. 5. Development of robust national M&E frameworks and public engagement strategies.",

    "abstract": "FLOWERING IN THE BACKYARD: The Experience of a Therapeutic Vegetable Garden at the University Hospital - Sustainability - Goethe and Steiner Phenomenology Social Therapy Program - Planetary Health. Introduction: Taking part in the activities at the HU Backyard Syntropic Community Garden has been an enriching and transformative experience, both for me and for the others involved. From the outset, the proposal to grow organic and medicinal food in line with the principles of syntropic agriculture has created a deep connection with nature and raised awareness of the importance of sustainable cultivation and biodiversity. Objective: To describe and reflect on the experience of participating in activities with the HU Backyard syntropic community garden, highlighting impacts on the connection with nature in promoção da saúde, environmental awareness and strengthening community bonds, as well as reflecting on practical learning related to sustainable management and integrative therapeutic actions. . Method: Experience report on the syntropic community garden in the backyard of the University Hospital. This report is based on personal observations, learnings and reflections, focusing on the subjective experience and the therapeutic and educational aspects experienced. Descrição of the experience: by getting involved in the routine of managing the vegetable garden, we were able to understand in practice the concepts of energetic renewal, and Goethe's and Steiner's phenomenological protocols for contemplating nature and observing how caring for the plants promotes a continuous cycle of evolution and balance in the system. We learn to select seeds from different times of the year, prepare the beds with seasonal consortium designs and understand the natural rhythms that govern cultivation. These activities reinforce our understanding of the positive impact of agroecological food, especially at a time when Brazil is facing increasing food insecurity. The contact with plants such as medicinal herbs, organic vegetables, fruit and flowers provided a unique sensory experience. During the activities, we used contemplation techniques to exercise our senses, such as our sense of smell as we took in the aroma of the herbs and our sense of sight as we observed the vibrant colors of the flowers. In addition, the practice of preparing recipes with ingredients harvested from the garden, especially teas made with medicinal herbs, brought a therapeutic and welcoming dimension, reinforcing the idea of self-care and self- Participating in artistic experiences such as singing, seasonal dance circles and the recording of harvests has helped to strengthen the link with Brazilian culture and the value of popular traditions. As well as stimulating creativity, these activities produce moments of joy and reflection, fostering a greater emotional connection with nature and with others (students, staff and volunteers). Another striking aspect was realizing the social and educational effect of these actions. By involving mothers, children, students and hospital staff, the garden has become a space for exchanging knowledge and raising environmental awareness. The visits and workshops sparked an interest in sustainable practices and valuing biodiversity, as well as promoting a sense of belonging and community responsibility. And we took the children and families of the Pediatric Clinics bundles of flowers and medicinal herbs from the seasonal harvest, with the music of the season, bridging the gap between nature and the Clinic, including the beauty, joy and harmony of nature in the hospital's routine. Conclusion: We conclude that the experience of the HU Backyard syntropic garden has been fundamental in reinforcing our commitment to sustainability and healthcare. It exemplifies how simple actions of cultivation and coexistence with nature can transform lives, promote integral health and strengthen human bonds in a hospital environment. This experience confirmed the importance of integrating agricultural, artistic and therapeutic practices in the context of health, contributing to a fairer, more balanced and harmonious society Hypothesis The use of social terapia intervençãos applied to therapeutic resources in the environment of the Backyard-Hospital Universitario and Pediatric-Clinic can contribute to well-being with nature and humanization in the quality of live of those involved, including knowledge and awareness. The hospital environment involves the complexity of human existence in a state of illness. Learning how to weave life goes beyond the mere interpretation of chemical-physical processes, because life, in its essence, transcends the sensory domain, it is a suprasensible reality, that is, it cannot be captured directly by the sense organs, which only apprehend its external manifestations8. Nowadays, it is extremely important to carry out intervençãos, research and further study into Art Therapy with nature, especially in its application to health in the context of Integrative Medicine. PICS, of which these intervençãos are a part, are therapeutic approaches that aim to prevent health problems, promote well-being and help patients recover. These approaches value attentive listening, the strengthening of the therapeutic bond and harmony between the individual, the environment and society. A significant obstacle is the scarcity of scientific studies that justify and support the incorporation of these therapies into the hospital environment. This reinforces the need for more in-depth research. Goethe and Steiner's Phenomenology in the Art of Nature intervençãos increase health-related qualidade de vida, help self-esteem and mood, reduce symptoms of ansiedade, depressão and pain, improve emotion , collaboration with the humanizing force of man with nature, man with himself and the humaanizing force of man in the social process.",

    "abstract": "Integrative and Complementary Health Practices (PICS) are present in some health-related university programs in Brazil, either through specific or general curricular components, as well as through practical experiential activities. Complementary spaces within acadêmico training, such as university extension activities, include these practices to offer PICS-based care to the acadêmico community. This approach has gained greater legitimacy since the implementation of the circularization of extension activities in 2022, established by the Ministry of Education (Resolution No. 7/2018). This process aims to integrate and formally recognize PICS actions that, until now, have occurred sporadically within certain undergraduate programs. This tendency is reinforced by the dialogical nature of PICS, its emphasis on active listening, the building of therapeutic relationships, its multiprofessional and interdisciplinary characteristics, and the provision of holistic care  all rooted in social and cultural dimensions shared by both PICS and the practice of university extension. This report aims to share the experience of implementing a curricular extension component titled Integrative and Complementary Health Practices, offered to students from the Biomedical Science, Nursing, and Physioterapia programs. The initiative was carried out in partnership with the PET Equidade Entre-Laços (Education through Work Program for Equity), which promotes the value of current and future SUS (Brazilian Unified Health System) workers. Following a planning phase and needs assessment conducted by PET and the Municipal Health Department (SMS), selected health units were identified and action plans developed. Students underwent training in PICS, specifically auriculoterapia and facial massage terapia (Tui Na), and were then assigned to health units under the supervision of faculty members from the Bahian School of Medicine and Public Health (EBMSP). PET students were responsible for recording and monitoring the PICS-based care provided to health workers and service users at five health units: UBS Cosme de Farias, USF Candeal Pequeno, UBS Saboeiro, USF Doron, and Aristides Maltês Hospital. Demographic data  including race, gender, age, and employment status  as well as work-related variables were collected, with the aim of future analysis of the profile of female workers who engage with PICS. The activities took place over eight consecutive weeks, each session lasting 2 to 3 hours, with groups of 10 students per unit. Each session involved collective integrative practices (e.g. yoga, meditação, Qi Gong, pranayama breathing techniques, music terapia, art terapia, Lian Gong, medicinal plants, and aromaterapia), followed by individual care in the form of facial massage (Tui Na) and auriculoterapia. Each session concluded with collective feedback, evaluation, and planning for the next meeting. The students main impressions recorded in field diaries and written reports were that the meetings were characterized by attentive listening and the exchange of experiences among workers, students, and extension participants, as well as by guidance on self-care. Collective care emerged as a generator of social support, while individual practices provided care centered on each person's uniqueness. Throughout the process, the strength of collective care in building social support networks became evident, contributing to a more supportive and welcoming work environment that fosters physical, emotional, and social wellbeing. The combination of active listening and integrative practices enabled professionals to feel valued, heard, and recognized as active agents in their own health journeys. For students, these spaces provided concrete experiences of holistic care and interprofessional collaboration, highlighting the importance of training that goes beyond technical competence to embrace humanization and dialogue with communities. These resultados underscore the significance of extension activities in health education, particularly by promoting practical experiences that integrate scientific knowledge, empathy, listening, and commitment to the guiding principles of the SUS. For students, this experience has been profoundly enriching. The opportunity to listen to SUS professionals and service users brought them closer to their future work environments. Engaging with PICS-based care across different moments of the project allowed students to observe both the health demands of female workers and the differentiated care that PICS can offer. The experience reinforces the universitys social role in training professionals committed to comprehensive care, equity, and the transformation of health realities in collaboration with the communities they serve.",

    "abstract": "Phenomenological approach is very useful to overcome disciplinary boundaries in biomolecular health sciences. Bignardi with his transdisciplinary team has developed a method to reach a consensus in a supradisciplinary diagnosis adopting phenomenological technics. In the health field, we identified opportunities for the application of phenomenological science as a resource to overcome the impermeability of watertight disciplinary areas, given the need for a consensual supradisciplinary diagnosis. The German Hospital Oswaldo Cruz , recognized for its excellence in care and innovation, in conjunction with its School of Health Sciences Education, promoted a workshop of \"Phenomenology applied to Health: promotion and assistance\", that took place in the Trianon Masp Park in São Paulo, the German Hospital Forest Oswaldo Cruz and in Botanical Garden of São Paulo (where there is garden and forest living side by side), in which the health professionals actively participated in an educational process, in which we observed the potential of this process as a means of equipping participants to apply phenomenological science, developing the potential for phenomenological observation of plants and people, and their perceptions in relation to the experiences experienced in this workshop. The workshop program consisted of a first day presenting theory and experiments in urban nature and a second day at the Botanical Garden with three steps: 1st walking in the park (garden) and after in the forest, answering the question: what the difference between the two environments is; 2nd specific plant observed by a group of 4 to 6 people; 3rd person observed using the same technique reaching a supradisciplinary diagnosis, through colours and forms expressed on a white paper. At the end of the workshop, participants were invited to answer a questionnaire with eight questions about their experience, including their perceptions regarding the difference between forest and garden, the theme of phenomenology, the experience of phenomenological observation of plants and people, and the perspective of applying it in their personal and professional lives. We base this relato de experiência on the phenomenological method of research, which presents itself as an alternative for investigating the fullness of the human being, capable of encompassing the totality of man, looking at things in themselves, in the sense that the entire process of knowledge production should be based on primary perceptions or the original meaning derived from lived experience (Husser, 1996). The purpose of this paper is to share and present the experience of an educational living class in a Botanical Garden affects the experience of individuals, exposing a group of post graduates students of Transdisciplinar Integrative Health course who had not yet experienced phenomenological observation in practice (Group A) and and professionals in the health or human sciences who were coming into contact with the topic for the first time (Group B), to a precise observation of plants and people following phenomenological steps culminating with the expression in colours and forms of the plant and people observed. Answers were about the experience during the workshop, concerning sensitivity, emotions, perceptions, and intellectual conclusions. Postgraduate students expressed their experience in the workshop with a more in-depth look and with greater prospects for personal and professional application. They understood phenomenology as a tool to reach true behind patients claim, amplifying the perception of each person in his vulnerability and complexity; and the phenomenological appreciation of plants has been experienced as an integration of knowledges, a marvellous feeling emerging for within, overcoming external concepts, allowing a feeling of being one with every living creature. In the experience of observing the person, they recognized a naked welcome, listening with the heart, similarities between all living beings Individuals who had their first contact with the subject were able to bring positive perceptions of the learning and applications in everyday life, expressing interest in delving deeper into the subject. They perceived phenomenology with scepticism, although it was possible to recognise the expansion that arises with this view, making possible a better connection with another person; for them, the phenomenological observation of plants it was more difficult to overcome preconceptions from education, childhood, becoming constricted to forms. During the phenomenological observation of people they felt a strong need to analyse and control, felt difficult to trust in intuitive feelings, was received with resistance, although recognised as tool to that brings reality from the silence. The workshop experience increases binding to Nature and Spirituality, consciousness of connections, believe in intuitive feelings for postgraduate students, with the realization that art and Nature should walk together with Health understanding, everything is connected. In the other group, the workshop aroused feelings of curiosity, fear, enthusiasm, confidence, trust, and the understanding that it is necessary to feel more than to interpret. Although the group of graduate students expressed their experience in the workshop with a more in-depth perspective and greater prospects for personal and professional application, we observed that individuals in the community who had their first encounter with the topic and lacked theoretical frameworks were able to bring positive perceptions of the learning and its applications in everyday life, expressing interest in delving deeper into the topic. We recognized from the participants' responses to the questionnaires that, despite the difference in depth of the workshop topic, their understanding of the experience in the garden and in the forest was similar. The group of graduate students who had affinity with the applied methodology was able to deepen their understanding through practical experience, with the experience being positive for those who had their first encounter with the topic. Given the results observed, we recommend replicating the methodology used in the workshop to develop individuals' ability to perceive the environment, themselves, and others, strengthening connections. We believe that the methodology applied in the workshop can be expanded to include lay members of the community, as it transcends acadêmico knowledge, providing a broader understanding of individuals in all their dimensions.",

The association provides multidisciplinary assistance to socioeconomically vulnerable autistic individuals and their families. Since 2017, flower essence terapia has been included as a complementary intervenção alongside conventional therapies such as speech terapia, psychology, occupational terapia, pedagogy, and music terapia, offered once a week. The service is conducted in a hybrid format: in-person, every fifteen days, and remotely. This hybrid model optimizes the children's access to therapies within limited timeframes. Autistic people are attended remotely based on information provided by parents and/or other family member through intake formsInitial Evaluation/Consent and Follow-Up, developed for the service. Dowsing is employed as a complementary diagnostic tool for the individualized selection of flower essences. The ranges used are: the traditional English Bach Flower Essences and the Brazilian Saint Germain Flower Essences. In addition to individual flower essence sessions for mothers and family members, time at the institution is also used to conduct informational talks on flower essence terapia. These include discussions, clarification of doubts and dynamics based on the healing qualities of flowers. These talk circles foster emotional expression, understanding and greater adherence to the terapia. Essences for autistic people are usually prepared in a sanitary alcohol gel base for topical use on the palms, according to the prescribed frequency. When preferred by mothers, they may also be formulated in oral dosage bottles or in spray, for emergency use at the institution. Initially, the preparation and supply of flower essences were entirely managed by the therapist at no cost to families, with continuous provision of Bach essences. A partnership with the producer of Saint Germain Flower Essences ensured regular support of this range. From 2020 onwards, a private pharmacy has assumed essence preparation for AAMPARA´s public as part of its corporate social responsibility. Before the COVID-19 pandemic, all intake forms were in paper. Post-pandemic, these were digitized, allowing enhanced individual therapeutic tracking and a collective overview of the service. In addition, due to researcher´s professional demands, from 2019 on, in person activities have started to be carried out by another therapist, well trained in flower essence terapia too. The researcher has continued attending the autistic public remotely and conducting lectures either on-line or in person for AAMPARA´s families. The present report covers the therapeutic resultados of 60 individuals aged 2 to 26 years, attended between September 2021 and April 2025. Overall data indicate significant improvements in core ASD symptoms, particularly social interaction (65%) and repetitive behaviours (61%). Positive changes in associated symptoms and comorbiditiessuch as self-injurious behaviours, enuresis, food selectivity, and sleep disorderswere also reported. In addition, the quickness parents report noticing positive changes reaches the sum of 61% in a period of less than month (18%) and 43% in a month. AAMPARA´s public have a very limited financial condition. Some families depend on government benefits to survive and have multiple autistic children. Due to an increased demand of specialized autism professionals, AAMPARA had to implement a social fee to maintain therapeutic services. However, even this can be unaffordable for some families. Therefore, the institution public big rotativity prevents a long-term tracking and comprehensive data collection. Another challenge is the limited literacy of many caregivers, which affect the quality of answers on intake forms and understanding of flower essence healing paradigm. Therefore, the presence of a therapist to facilitate activities is essential to promote therapeutic adhesion. Flower essence terapia implementation at AAMPARA resulted from a meeting between the researcher and its president, who has agreed to trying flower essences for her 17-year-old daughter. The young lady has suffered from sleep disorders, since an autistic regression at 18 months. Both parents used to alternate during the nights due to her restless sleep and intense self-injuring movements. The family have tried different tratamentos without success. Initially suspicious and hopeless, the mother consented to topical application of essences on her daughters hands. Within a month, the young lady was sleeping deeply and peacefully, surprising her parents. Both mother and daughter continue to use flower essences until today. Since AAMPARA´s public has a restricted access to conventional therapies, flower essence terapia has emerged as a key complementary intervenção for its further development. The present report reflects collective data obtained through Initial Evaluation and Follow-Up forms, aligned with the Brazilian acadêmico calendar: forms are distributed at the beginning of the year and before or after mid- and end-of-year holidays. The follow-up data confirm consistent improvements in key ASD areas, especially social interaction (65%) and repetitive behaviours (61%). Caregivers frequently report rapid onset of positive changes. In addition, the not at all option remains low or absent across nearly all evaluation items, suggesting broad-spectrum efficacy. Although the degree of improvement varies, each person received a personalized formula, demonstrating the importance of individualized approach. Issues such as sleep disorders, food selectivity, and urinary control showed notable progress. Even small improvements can have a profound impact on family well-being. The implementation of flower essence terapia depends on the kind of institution and staff. At AAMPARA, the hybrid service model has proven feasible for a limited number of families. However, for broader application, it is essential to plan how essences will be provided for the public. AAMPARA has opted to fully support the provision of flower essences to its public. In Brazil, since Flower essence terapia is already included in the Brazilian National Health Service (SUS) and many professionals councils have already regulated the use of flower essences by their members, offering this service at saúde pública units, aimed for people with autism, could be of considerable help for low-income families all across the country. At AAMPARA, all therapists involved in the service undergo specific training to ensure competent and ethical care. The positive resultados observed at AAMPARA Autism support further scientific research to consolidate the use of flower essences as a natural and safe complementary intervenção for people with autism of all ages.",

    "abstract": "Auriculoterapia is a recognized integrative and complementary health practice increasingly used to promote, maintain, and restore both physical and mental health. Grounded in diverse medical rationalitiessuch as Reflexology, Neurophysiological Biomedicine, and Traditional Chinese Medicinethis approach has been widely implemented in Brazil, with positive impacts on the mental health and qualidade de vida of healthcare professionals and university students. This abstract presents the institutional experience of implementing auriculoterapia at the Humanization and Care Unit of the Health Sciences Center, Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (CCS/UFRJ). Established in 2017, the unit was designed to support the acadêmico communityincluding professors, students, and administrative staffthrough a holistic model of care that acknowledges healing as an integrative process involving body, mind, and spirit. The initiative emerges within a broader context of growing mental health challenges in acadêmico settings and adopts the biopsychosocial-spiritual model of health, addressing the physical, emotional, social, and spiritual dimensions of human experience. The current auriculoterapia protocol was initiated in March 2025. The service is offered free of charge and voluntarily provided by a healthcare professional certified in auriculoterapia by the Federal University of Santa Catarina and the Brazilian Ministry of Health. Sessions are held once a week (Tuesdays), from 10:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m., by prior appointment via the units email. The practice is promoted through social media and posters placed in high-traffic campus areas. Each session lasts approximately 10 minutes, with the initial appointment taking 20 to 30 minutes to allow for a more comprehensive assessment. The protocol recommends a tratamento plan of 5 to 8 sessions, depending on the individual's progress and needs. On the first day, no more than 10 auricular points are selected to be used throughout all sessions. At the end of each session, participants are advised to retain the mustard seeds on the auricle for five days and to perform gentle self-massage on the stimulated points three times daily to enhance therapeutic effects. The methodology includes: (1) compassionate listening and presence, anamnesis, and a structured intake interview conducted during the first session; (2) application of mustard seeds to auricular points based on the main complaint; and (3) laying on of hands over the auricular regiona culturally sensitive practice acknowledged across multiple traditions. During the initial consultation, data are collected on sociodemographic profile, clinical history, medication use, religiosity and spirituality, previous experience with complementary or spiritual practices, and emotional or psychological distress associated with the main complaint. Pain intensityboth physical and emotionalis measured using the Verbal Numeric Scale (VNS, range 0-10) before, during, and after the intervenção. All information is recorded in internal reports, in accordance with Brazils General Data Protection Law (LGPD  Law No. 13,709/2018). The escalating mental health crisis in academia calls for sustainable, concrete responses. In an environment marked by overload, competition, and isolation, this initiative offers institutional care, support, and prevenção through an integrative complementary health practice coupled with active and compassionate listening. It fosters self-care and belonging via a biopsychosocial-spiritual model, challenging the prevailing mechanistic approach and promoting cultural transformation toward holistic health in academia. A preliminary analysis of data collected between March and July 2025 shows that 9 individuals were treated by the sector, including 2 administrative staff members, 1 doctoral student, and 3 undergraduate students. The average age of participants was 31 years. A total of 89% self-identified as Black and 11% as White. All participants (100%) reported ansiedade as one of their main complaints and approximately 44% also reported feelings of worry. Fear and sadness were each reported by 22% of participants. Additionally, 78% reported weakened willpower, 44% reported pessimism, 67% experienced insomnia, 67% reported having fixed ideas, and 78% described intrusive thinking patterns. Regarding physical pain, 56% of participants reported experiencing some level of pain during the initial interview: one person described mild pain (VNS=3), one moderate pain (VNS=4), another moderate pain (VNS=5), and two reported severe pain (VNS=8). Emotional pain was reported by 78% of participants: one person described mild emotional pain (VNS=3), two reported moderate emotional pain (VNS=5 and 6), and three reported severe emotional pain (VNS=7). Among the 22% who completed the tratamento, 11% reported a reduction in physical pain from moderate to mild (initial VNS=4, final VNS=2), and 11% experienced a decrease in emotional pain from moderate to no pain between the first and third sessions (initial VNS=6, third session VNS=0). However, from the third to the final session, emotional pain increased to a severe level (VNS=8). Despite this, the participant reported engaging in self-care practices, attending psychoterapia, and actively seeking ways to address emotional challenges. Furthermore, 44% of participants reported attending psychoterapia, 66% reported engaging in physical activity or physioterapia, and 67% engaged in spiritual practices such as prayer, uplifting reading, or meditação. A total of 78% stated that their spirituality or faith helps them cope with their current difficulties. At the time of analysis, 22% of participants were still undergoing tratamento, while 56% discontinued the proposed tratamento before completing the number of sessions recommended by the therapist. An investigation is underway to better understand the reasons behind tratamento discontinuation in each case. Additionally, we are exploring the possibility of offering a training course to prepare more volunteer auriculotherapists, aiming to increase service capacity and expand support through this practice. Key challenges include improving data management, training new auriculotherapists, expanding services, refining protocols, establishing longitudinal follow-up, conducting research to evaluate resultados, and raising awareness among acadêmico leadership. Institutional recognition with financial and logistical support is essential for sustainability and impact. Integrating care practices into university routines is both a therapeutic and a political-ethical imperative given the widespread psychological distress in acadêmico communities.",

    "abstract": "The Faculdade de Medicina do ABC (FMABC), located in Santo André, São Paulo, Brazil, is a public medical school known for its commitment to educational innovation and community-oriented health training. In response to growing global recognition of Integrative Medicine (IM) and its potential contributions to holistic, patient-centered care, FMABC became the first medical school in Brazil to formally introduce a structured IM course in 2017. This elective course was designed to fill critical gaps in conventional medical training by providing students with scientific, baseado em evidence exposure to complementary practices such as acupuntura, fitoterapia, Ayurveda, Reiki, and others. Initially launched in 2017 with one pilot group, the course gradually expanded through growing student demand and institutional support. Each edition of the course offers a 40-hour workload, divided into lectures, experiential learning, and extracurricular activities. Materials and procedures include acadêmico articles, clinical case discussions, hands-on demonstrations, and guided practice sessions. The course is coordinated by FMABC faculty and delivered by nationally and internationally recognized professionals in their respective IM areas. Evaluation includes attendance, participation, and a written exam. The timeline of the initiative includes: 2017: Pilot implementation 2018: Launch of the Integrative Medicine Academic League 2018present: Course expansion, institutional collaborations, and national/international recognition Problemas Abordados Despite official recognition of Integrative Medicine (IM) by the Brazilian Ministry of Health, its inclusion in undergraduate medical education remains minimal. At FMABC and most medical schools in Brazil, students previously lacked formal exposure to integrative health practices. This led to the following challenges: Limited curricular space for non-conventional, holistic health perspectives. Lack of scientific, baseado em evidence exposure to complementary therapies, with knowledge often restricted to informal or anecdotal sources. Persistent misconceptions about the scientific validity and clinical relevance of IM. There was a clear educational need to create an acadêmicoally rigorous space for medical students to critically engage with integrative practices and develop a more comprehensive understanding of patient care. Results Since its implementation in 2017, the IM course at FMABC has yielded notable resultados: Enrollment and demand: Over 120 students per year participate in the course. Capacity is regularly exceeded, leading to waitlists. Student feedback: More than 85% of participants report positive shifts in empathy, communication skills, and openness to interdisciplinary care. Academic League: In 2018, the Integrative Medicine Academic League was established, offering ongoing student engagement through seminars, events, and peer education. Interdepartmental collaboration: The course has facilitated partnerships with clinical and preclinical departments and integration with internship opportunities, especially in Family and Community Medicine. Research and outreach: Student-led research projects and community extension initiatives have emerged from the program. International recognition: In 2018, the program received an award at the International Congress of Integrative Medicine and Health, validating its educational innovation. Based on FMABCs experience, the following recommendations are suggested for institutions considering similar initiatives: Start as an elective: This allows for pilot testing, stakeholder engagement, and gradual scaling based on demand. Invest in faculty training: Address skepticism and ensure scientific rigor through continuous education and access to updated literature. Use a critical, baseado em evidence approach: Present integrative practices within a scientific framework to encourage informed inquiry. Collaborate with experts: Involve certified professionals and researchers from diverse IM areas to enrich course content. Create continuity structures: Support acadêmico leagues or student-led initiatives to sustain interest beyond the course. Address institutional resistance: Use data, dialogue, and phased implementation to overcome barriers such as curriculum rigidity and bias. Seek visibility and partnerships: Participate in acadêmico events and network with other institutions to expand impact and gain support. FMABCs initiative illustrates that it is both possible and beneficial to integrate Integrative Medicine into medical education, fostering more empathetic, holistic, and reflective future physicians.",

    "abstract": "Individuals with chronic kidney disease (CKD), in addition to undergoing hemodialysis (HD) tratamento for 4 hours, three times per week, experience significant changes in their lifestyle, as well as in their family and social relationships, which ultimately lead to impaired qualidade de vida (QoL) and an increased risk of depressão. Similar to initiatives already implemented in several European countries, it is plausible that the intervenção of musicians specially trained to work in hospital settings and other care environments (Integrative Musicians) could serve as a humanizing strategy for individuals with CKD undergoing HD, potentially resulting in improvements in these adverse conditions.Objective: To identify the potential influences of musicians performance, through musical intervenção (MI) during hemodialysis (HD) sessions, on qualidade de vida (QoL), depressão parameters, and the subjective sense of well-being of patients undergoing HD at the Dialysis and Renal Transplant Center (CDTR) in Sorocaba, SP.BRAZIL. Assessment Methods: Quality of life (QoL) was evaluated using the Kidney Disease and Quality of Life  Short Form (KDQOL-SF) version 1.3 questionnaire, and depressão status was assessed with the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D). Participants: The study included 24 patients over 18 years old who had been undergoing hemodialysis for more than six months at the CDTR. Of these, 12 patients comprised the control group (no intervenção), and 12 patients received the musicians intervenção for 5 months during their regular Saturday HD sessions. Procedures: An open-ended questionnaire was administered to patients to assess receptivity and the effects of the intervenção. The participants responses were subjected to thematic analysis and subsequently to the Collective Subject Discourse analysis technique (Lefèvre). Following the intervenção of the Elo Musicians at the CDTR, we observed changes both in the patients and the staff, with significant improvements in patients qualidade de vida and well-being. Quality of life indicators showed enhancements in emotional health, social functioning, illness perception, and motivation to engage in activities. Depression markers revealed that half of the patients who initially exhibited signs of depressão experienced substantial improvement, no longer classified within the moderate to severe depressão group according to the HAM-D scale assessment. The patients subjective perceptions of the Elo Musicians intervenção were confirmed through discourse analysis, which revealed expressions of determination and a desire for improved well-being. Additionally, improvements were noted in the social and affective relationships among the patientstafffamily triad. As observers of the process, despite being involved in it, we were also able to conclude that the transformative role of the musicians in the hemodialysis environment, even over a short period, triggered a significant initial change that consolidated over time. From this subsequent phase onward, the impact extended beyond the music, the musicians, and their immediate effects, leading to behavioral changes in the individuals who experienced the process. Those involved in the project became more proactive, attentive, and sensitive toward the patientsas if discovering the person behind the ill body. We also observed improved relationships among staff membersas if uncovering the person behind the colleague. In sum, the entire hemodialysis environment underwent a profound transformation.",

    "abstract": "Planetary health integrates systemic thinking across human, political, economic, environmental, and social systems, supporting the development of interdisciplinary approaches to health and sustainability challenges. The Planet&AR Project was developed to identify health and environmental vulnerabilities on Maré Island, a territory historically inhabited by Indigenous populations and now home to a predominantly Quilombola community. This region faces high environmental and socioeconomic vulnerability, particularly due to industrial activities and limited access to healthcare services. Objective: To promote medical student immersion in a vulnerable territory and to expand their understanding of the health-disease process using a planetary health approach. Following preparatory workshops on planetary health concepts, 16 medical students participated in a 3-day immersive experience on Maré Island. The immersion included guided community walks, conversations with residents and health workers, and observation of living conditions and environmental risks. A qualitativo and exploratory research design was adopted. Group reflections and structured discussion circles were used to stimulate critical thinking and document students' learning. The pedagogical method was grounded in experiential learning and socioenvironmental contextualization. Results During the immersion, students identified multiple determinants of health, including water and air pollution, poor sanitation infrastructure, and systemic inequalities. They also recognized the cultural resilience and environmental knowledge embedded in the local populations way of life. Students reported a shift in perspective, gaining a deeper understanding of the links between environmental degradation, climate change, and social injustice. The experience fostered a more integrative view of clinical practice, particularly in contexts of vulnerability. Discussion The immersive experience proved to be a valuable pedagogical tool for introducing planetary health in medical education. By engaging directly with a marginalized community, students were able to reflect on the limitations of traditional biomedical training and the need for a broader, interdisciplinary approach. Although no formal evaluation was conducted, the documented reflections and group discussions provided insights into the transformative potential of such experiences. Further studies with pre- and post-immersion assessments are recommended to evaluate long-term educational impact. This experience may serve as a model for integrating planetary health concepts into the curricula of Brazilian medical schools. This approach not only enhances acadêmico training but also equips physicians with a holistic perspective essential for addressing the challenges posed by climate change and social inequality. Initiatives like the Planet&AR Project are therefore vital for transforming medical education and advancing responses to both environmental and health crises.",

    "abstract": "The group entitled \"Bem Viver\" (Good Living) began in May 2023 with the goal of promoting mental health and consequently improving the qualidade de vida of individuals over 18 years of age with mild to moderate mental disorders. Meetings take place every Tuesday during the mental health internship period of the Occupational Therapy program at the Teaching Clinic of a federal university in southeastern Brazil. The average attendance is five participants per meeting, the majority of whom are female, ranging in age from 24 to 73. During the sessions, topics related to mental health and the participants' daily lives are addressed. Meditation and aromaterapia techniques are then applied, and at the end, participants' experiences are shared. In addition to contributing to the interns' professional development, the group serves as an example of a feasible mental healthcare intervenção, considering each member's uniqueness when planning the weekly meetings. Among the approaches used, aromaterapia and meditação were used to achieve relaxation and stress reduction, improve mood, and provide a moment of self-care. Mental disorders are illnesses with psychological manifestations associated with some functional impairment resulting from biological, social, psychological, genetic, physical, or chemical dysfunction. Integrative and Complementary Health Practices (PICS) are alternatives for preventing and treating health problems, as stated by the Ministry of Health: \"These are tratamentos that use therapeutic resources based on traditional knowledge, aimed at preventing various diseases, such as depressão and hypertension\" (Brazil, 2020). They stimulate natural mechanisms \"through effective and safe technologies, with an emphasis on supportive listening, the development of therapeutic bonds, and the integration of human beings with the environment and society\" (Brazil, 2018, p. 7). Aromaterapia \"is indicated for various mental health conditions, such as insomnia, stress, ansiedade, pain, depressão, and other organic diseases and discomforts.\" The aroma and particles released by essential oils stimulate different parts of the brain, helping to alleviate various symptoms and pathologies (FIOCRUZ, 2025). Meditation is an ancient practice that \"consists of training the focus of attention in a non-analytical or discriminative way, reducing repetitive thinking, and cognitive reorientation.\" Furthermore, it \"promotes favorable changes in mood and improves cognitive performance, providing greater integration between mind, body, and the outside world\" (Brasil, 2025). This study concludes that Integrative and Complementary Practices, Aromaterapia, and Meditation, used as care technologies in a mental health group, contributed to promoting well-being, greater intimacy and self-awareness, relaxation, stress reduction, improved mood, and, consequently, helped promote mental health.",
