The project is aligned with the National Policy for Integrative and Complementary Practices (PNPIC) of the Unified Health System (SUS), seeking to offer a complementary and integrative approach to the treatment of anxiety, benefiting both the academic community (faculty and students) and the population surrounding the Higher Education Institution (HEI). The project's objectives include promoting a holistic approach to mental and physical well-being, fostering knowledge exchange, and training healthcare professionals with a broader and more humanized perspective. Activities and Methodology. The project's main activities include: Auriculotherapy: Treatments are offered twice a week, using a specific protocol of nine auricular points from Traditional Chinese Medicine: She Men, Sympathetic Nervous System, Kidney, Liver, Spleen, Pancreas, Heart, Occipital, Neurasthenia, and Anxiety. This approach aims to integrate anxiety treatment based on physiology and TCM diagnosis. Collective Body Practices: The project also offers practices such as Tai Chi Chuan, Qi Gong, Circle Dance, Yoga, and Meditation, which complement individual interventions. Acupuncture: Five acupuncture sessions are offered per shift, twice a week, performed by trained professionals. It is important to emphasize that the project does not aim to make clinical diagnoses of mental health problems. Rather, it meets the spontaneous demand of users seeking relief from physical and emotional pain, many of whom already have prior diagnoses and are referred by qualified health professionals. The project team includes the active participation of 10 students, who receive initial training on the principles of Traditional Chinese Medicine and auriculotherapy protocols for anxiety. One of the challenges identified during the project's implementation is balancing outreach activities with the students' academic lives. Data collection is conducted through Google Forms, administered after each session, with open- and closed-ended questions. The results are presented qualitatively and quantitatively, with the qualitative data interpreted based on Bardin's (2006) content analysis methodology. This outreach project represents an initiative to integrate TCIM into public and university health contexts, contributing to the dissemination of complementary practices and the training of professionals committed to a comprehensive approach to healthcare.;The applicability of TCIM has increased as the world becomes increasingly fluid (BAUMAN, 2012), bringing a lot of instability and liquidity to affective, social, and professional relationships. This leads to the belief that the absence of solid and lasting structures can compromise and aggravate interpersonal and family relationships, resulting in conflicts in affective and professional relationships. This fact has contributed to anxiety disorders, adding different problems to physical and mental health, demanding the integration of shared knowledge and specializations to meet the vicissitudes of the modern world. However, modernity has brought advances and proposals for innovation in the health field, which can also be understood as an expression of a movement that identifies with new ways of learning and practicing health, as these practices are characterized by interdisciplinarity and unique languages (TELESI JUNIOR, 2016).The project can be sustainable in the long term and potentially viable to serve a larger number of people. Furthermore, exploring possible partnerships with local health agencies or other institutions would ensure the strengthening and greater engagement of the community in adopting the practices.;University outreach activities play an important role in the dialectical communication between academia and the community, contributing to knowledge and health promotion in diverse contexts. This study describes outreach activities focused on integrative practices, carried out at two strategic locations in the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil: the Dr. Guilherme Romano Polyclinic and the Idomed Città Campus. A total of 161 auriculotherapy sessions were recorded, in addition to acupuncture and bodywork sessions, with proposed therapeutic interactions with the community. The results accumulated since the project's inception indicate a total of 161 auriculotherapy sessions, complemented by acupuncture and bodywork sessions. During data collection, participants reported predominant complaints of anxiety, insomnia, muscle pain, and difficulty maintaining focus and concentration. Participant testimonials highlight the positive impact of the sessions on individual health, with emphasis on the promotion of self-care. The perception of improvement and the individuals' protagonism in their own health recovery reinforce the benefits of these interventions. At the same time, the project has contributed to the development of extension students. Increased autonomy and professional responsibility have been observed, as well as a deeper understanding of Traditional Medicine and integrative practices. The application of the Person-Centered Clinical Method, with the use of tools to establish effective communication and sensitive listening, has enhanced the students' ability to provide humane and comprehensive care. The patient-centered approach and integration with public health policies reinforce the importance and impact of these initiatives. The project not only provides relief from anxiety-related complaints but also empowers individuals to practice self-care, contributing to the development of professionals with a broader and more humane view of care.;The following recommendations are proposed to strengthen and optimize the impact of the project: Continuous training, promotion of workshops and seminars for students and teachers, with the participation of specialists in Complementary and Integrative Health Practices, in order to deepen the theoretical and practical knowledge of the interventions. Strengthening training with systematic reviews and evidence maps to deepen the theoretical foundation and scientific evidence for each specific practice. Documenting detailed case studies of participants with different profiles and responses to interventions, to illustrate the qualitative impact of the project.;"Integrative and Complementary Practices; Integrative Medicine; Comprehensiveness; Anxiety"

Among the research developed is the “Platform of Knowledge (PK): Promoting health and well-being through community involvement and participation in innovative actions for health promotion and knowledge production, with emphasis on integrative and complementary practices (ICP)”, which enables active participation of society, also providing subsidies for the social emancipation of those impacted by its actions and contributions to the formulation of public policies. The PK is an initiative that promotes health, care for participants through actions that value and stimulate creativity, experimentation and interdisciplinary, that is, a form of social inclusion, improved self-esteem and reduced inequalities. Since music therapy is one of the 29 ICP institutionalized by the Brazilian Ministry of Health, this practice was used as an innovative proposal to contribute to the social transformation of the community, empowerment and health care. This manuscript aims to report the experience of implementing Music Therapy Workshops (MTW) within the scope of the PK and the impact of this collective practice on the health of its participants. We used the main music therapy methods (improvisation, recreation, composition and listening). The guests for the activity are people living with infectious diseases (e.g. HIV/Aids, Chagas disease), chronic diseases (e.g. breast cancer, other neoplasms), health problems (e.g. anxiety, depression), and their respective friends/family members also participate. The music therapy practices were developed in groups and in different spaces on the Fiocruz campus. All the MTW were preceded by a discussion group with an invited multidisciplinary team (epidemiologist, infectologist, physiotherapist, nutritionist, psychologist, among others) to carry out the activity according to each topic addressed. The project received financial support from Faperj, the INOVA/FiopromoS/Fiocruz Program and approval from the ECNIID/Fiocruz Research Ethics Committee.;The Fiocruz is located in Manguinhos, in the northern part of the city of Rio de Janeiro, a conflict zone with limited and decreasing resources. Together with the communities surrounding Fiocruz, we have experienced that violence is exercised, above all, as a social process, although it is not limited to the health sector. Thus, we must exercise our ethical commitment as public health professionals in developing strategies that contribute to strengthening the community and that enable people to help each other and develop their potential, autonomy, empowerment and improve their quality of life. It is within this context that music therapy fits in, not only within the scope of interdisciplinarity and as one of the ICP, but also as a specialty. The use of music as a power of displacement (which represents how much of the apparent power is transformed into active power), of reinvention, of creativity, can act as a health promotion device, that is, an effective tool to promote social transformation.;"We held five MTW from September to December 2024, with groups ranging from 15 to 23 participants per MTW. Topics covered (some held during months of health campaigns aimed at raising awareness and preventing diseases): 1) Long Covid from an interdisciplinary perspective; 2) Pink October: promoting care through art; 3) Discussion circle on autism with a technical visit to the Butterfly House at the Museum of Life/Oswaldo Cruz Foundation; 4) Blue November: Integrative Community Therapy; 5) World Aids Day. The guitar was the harmonic instrument used in the MTW, in addition to other percussion instruments (tambourine, afoxé, key chimes, castanets, rattles made from PET bottles with beads, and rattles made from PET bottle caps – providing the sound of rain/sea). The participants, predominantly (90%) women aged between 53 and 82, were able to handle and try out the percussion instruments. Some reports from the participants about the evaluation of the MTW: “While you are having fun with the music you are not thinking about other things... music can help bring joy, to get rid of bad thoughts and negativity from your heart”... “I think that the music, the meetings... the development of the workshops is a great job...” (61 years old, male, incomplete elementary education, living with HIV), “It’s really cool; it builds motivation inside of us... I was in that euphoria... my evaluation is positive, it has to continue [referring to the continuity of the MTW]...” (63 years old, male, higher education living with HIV); “I heard the doctor’s guitar [patient with hearing loss due to a previous history of meningitis], but I don’t hear the voice... only when they speak really loudly, I hear the rattle, the tambourine... for me it was great! Even though I don't listen to it, I still like it. This is really good for me. I heard that little round thing that I don't know the name of with blue dots [afoxé] (79 years old, female, high school graduate, living with HIV), “Wonderful, we wrote the lyrics!!! You have to play it for us whenever you have activities... give us the lyrics so we can practice at home and when we get here [to Fiocruz] we'll already know... to sing along with you...” (57 years old, female, high school graduate, living with breast cancer). These are some opinions, the participants also expressed many others, but overall the activity encouraged their engagement and involvement in the music therapy process, motivating them to play, listen, improvise and compose collectively. ";We expect to continue the PK activities, promoting health and producing knowledge, as the data presented suggest how powerful MTW are for the physical, social, mental, emotional, spiritual and cognitive well-being of people in social vulnerability.;"health promotion; Music Therapy; User Embracement; Consumer Participation; Quality of Life"

Patient care in the period leading up to and after surgery can have as much or even more impact than the anesthesia itself on the overall outcome of the entire process. By incorporating Ayurvedic principles into patient care in this setting, a unique opportunity is created to make management increasingly individualized, increasing safety and reducing the rate of complications.;"There are three distinct moments in which Ayurveda is being incorporated into patient care. First, the patient is prepared for Ayurvedic Pre-Anesthetic care, which is performed on an outpatient basis at our hospital a few weeks before surgery. Patients are referred by the Oncology Service. Therefore, they all have oncological diseases that require surgery. We provide care in several specialties within Oncology, such as Mastology, Urology, Gynecology and Digestive System Surgery, including Proctology. In addition to conventional guidance on medication management and fasting, patients receive a prescription for a diet and individualized routines that focus on optimizing the digestive process and improving the immune system. The goal is for patients to arrive in the best possible physical, mental, emotional and spiritual state for the day of their surgery. Breathing exercises (Pranayama) are also prescribed and guided meditations are offered as non-pharmacological tools for managing preoperative anxiety. We treat an average of six patients per week.
Secondly, the moment of the surgery itself. The Ayurvedic diagnosis of each patient makes it possible to make several predictions regarding the patient's behavior during the intraoperative period. These predictions range from the optimization of anesthetic doses, the need for thermal management, to the more stable or unstable response of the autonomic nervous system to surgical stimuli. Understanding the patient's functioning from an Ayurvedic perspective allows the anesthetist to act in a more individualized manner, including during anesthesia.
Thirdly, another very important moment where the insertion of Ayurveda is essential is in the immediate postoperative period, carried out in the post-anesthesia recovery room. After several meetings with the Nursing and Nutrition teams, changes were made to some routines. The temperature control in the recovery room is more rigorous, in order to ensure that the environment is not cold for our patients. All patients receive blankets to help maintain body temperature. Hypothermia in the postoperative period is a frequent complication, and taking this precaution brings many benefits to patients. Early return to diet is another aspect that impacts favorable results. Patients receive a diet according to a flowchart developed and guided by Ayurveda. Initially, they receive small doses of warm water, then an herbal tea, and, before being discharged to the inpatient unit, they receive a soup broth. The method aids the process of rekindling digestive fire, known as agni in Ayurveda, which requires a gradual and systematic approach. This is achieved through a carefully curated diet that supports the process of digestion. Also, the inherent nature of food plays a crucial role in the process, as different foods possess different qualities that can either stimulate or hinder digestive function. Hence special emphasis is laid on selection of the ingredients, selection of the method of preparing and the portion size. Some patients receive a padabhyanga before being discharged from the recovery room. Padabhyanga is an Ayurvedic body therapy that consists of a foot massage with medicated and heated oil. The goal is to promote tissue nutrition, improve blood circulation, stimulate the nervous system, and provide relief from anxiety, among other things. Initial observations of patients receiving this therapy in the recovery room have shown a decrease in pain scores.";;One of the biggest challenges faced in implementing Ayurvedic care in a hospital setting is the lack of information among professionals. Several workshops, lectures and meetings were necessary for these new routines to be effectively implemented. The next goal will be to conduct research that can demonstrate the high level of evidence of the benefits that integrative practices through Ayurveda have in reducing postoperative complications, improving patient safety, reducing hospital stays and, above all, improving the quality of the entire experience for each patient.;"ayurveda; anesthesia; anesthesia department hospital; anesthesia recovery period; "

The institution operates close to full capacity and treats a broad spectrum of acute psychiatric conditions including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, severe depression, substance use disorders, psychotic episodes, and dementia-related complications. Its multidisciplinary team includes psychiatrists, psychologists, nursing staff, social workers, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, and kitchen staff, all of whom are actively involved in the integrative process. The introduction of Ayurveda required careful alignment with existing workflows and treatment standards. Educational sessions familiarized staff with Ayurvedic principles, focusing on nutrition and detoxification therapies as complementary interventions.;With the rising prevalence of psychiatric disorders, innovative approaches are needed to enhance treatment outcomes while reducing side effects and institutional burden. Integrating Ayurveda into an acute setting addresses somatic symptoms, supports gut–brain communication, and optimizes psychotherapeutic interventions. However, psychiatric hospitals often operate at full capacity, making integration complex. Successful implementation requires interdisciplinary collaboration and structured education across all departments.;"Up to now, full Panchakarma therapies could not be implemented due to ongoing renovation works. Instead, individualized Ayurvedic interventions were delivered, tailored to each patient’s specific complaints. Treatments included Abhyangam with Mahanarayan thailam or Chandanlaxadi oil, Shirodhara with Brahmi tailam, Takra dhara, and nasal therapies (Nasya with Khadbindu tailam, Anu tailam, or Ksheerabala 101, combined with Triphala churna), alongside dietary counselling according to Vata-pacifying principles.

Within the first four months, more than 500 inpatients received such individualized therapies, with consistently promising outcomes. Patients reported improvements in relaxation, sleep quality, energy levels, and daily structure, while therapists observed greater openness and engagement in psychotherapy sessions. In one illustrative case of chronic tinnitus, the patient underwent 12 sessions over four weeks (Abhyangam with Mahanarayan thailam), head oil applications with Brahmi Tailam (Shiropichu, Thalam), and nasal therapies (Pratimarsha or Marsha Nasya with Ksheerabala 101 and Triphala powder), alongside dietary counselling, resulting in a marked reduction in symptom severity from 8/10 to 2/10.

In addition, informal feedback polls from patients, family members, and healthcare professionals were consistently positive. Patients and relatives emphasized that they felt more supported through the holistic approach, while staff highlighted improved interdisciplinary collaboration and enhanced therapeutic engagement.

Preliminary findings demonstrate that integrating individualized Ayurvedic therapies into acute psychiatric care is both feasible and beneficial. This approach enhances patient well-being, supports psychotherapy, and offers long-term clinical and economic potential. The guiding principle remains: 'Modern medicine leads, Ayurveda is lived.
";Key challenges include navigating complex institutional structures, overcoming initial skepticism, and aligning Ayurvedic methods with evidence-based psychiatric care. Financial investment for staff training and resources is required but is expected to be offset by long-term savings through reduced medication dependency, shorter hospital stays, and improved outcomes.;"ayurveda; Acute Psychiatric; Panchakarma; Detoxification; Psychotherapy"

Rooted in natural and holistic principles, Ayurveda offers a unique perspective on preventive healthcare, and disease management. In recent years, India has made significant strides in systematically integrating Ayurveda into its national public health framework. In India, through supportive policies, institutional infrastructure, and strategic healthcare initiatives, Ayurveda is being positioned strengthens population health.
Recognizing the significance of traditional medicine in health promotion and disease prevention, the Government of India established the Ministry of AYUSH (Ayurveda, Yoga & Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, and Homeopathy) in 2014. This ministry plays a pivotal role in overseeing the development, standardization, education, and regulation of traditional medicine systems across the country. It ensures that Ayurveda and related systems are not only preserved but also integrated meaningfully into the broader healthcare landscape.
One of the cornerstone programs promoting Ayurveda within the public health system is the National AYUSH Mission (NAM). Launched with the goal of revitalizing and promoting the AYUSH systems of medicine through cost-effective services and quality control, NAM focuses on improving access to AYUSH services in both urban and rural settings. It facilitates the establishment of AYUSH Health and Wellness Centers (AHWCs), which are integral to India’s Ayushman Bharat initiative—a transformative health policy that aims to achieve Universal Health Coverage (UHC).
AHWCs bring Ayurvedic doctors and community health workers together under one roof to provide comprehensive care that includes disease prevention, lifestyle counseling, and traditional remedies. These centers offer services ranging from personalized diet and lifestyle plans to herbal medicine prescriptions, yoga sessions, and seasonal detoxification therapies. Not only do they reduce the burden on conventional medical systems, but they also promote culturally acceptable, affordable, and community-based interventions. This model has shown promising results in increasing health-seeking behavior and managing chronic conditions in rural populations.
In addition to infrastructural expansion, integrative hospital models are being developed where Ayurvedic and allopathic practitioners co-manage patients. These institutions—such as the All India Institute of Ayurveda (AIIA) in New Delhi and several AIIMS campuses with AYUSH departments—offer collaborative care protocols that draw on the strengths of both systems. Integrative treatment approaches are being explored for conditions like diabetes, arthritis, gastrointestinal disorders, and even post-COVID rehabilitation. Case studies from these institutions demonstrate that blending traditional and modern interventions can lead to improved patient outcomes, enhanced satisfaction, and reduced healthcare costs.
A major area where Ayurveda has shown measurable impact is in the management of non-communicable diseases (NCDs), which include cardiovascular disorders, diabetes, cancer, and respiratory diseases. These diseases, driven largely by lifestyle factors, require a multidimensional management strategy. Ayurveda, with its emphasis on Dinacharya (daily routine), Ritucharya (seasonal routine), and Swasthavritta (principles of health maintenance), provides effective lifestyle interventions. Programs like AYUSH Lifestyle Guidelines for Prevention of NCDs promote dietary changes, herbal supplementation, stress management practices, and physical activity, aligning well with the WHO’s strategies on NCD control.
In the area of maternal and child health, Ayurvedic antenatal care packages—focused on nutritional support, herbal tonics, and postnatal care—have been introduced in several government health facilities. These interventions aim to reduce pregnancy-related complications, improve maternal mental health, and enhance neonatal outcomes. Research-backed interventions such as Garbh Sanskar (Ayurvedic prenatal education and rituals) are being revisited for their potential role in fostering early childhood development.
Ayurveda’s mental health interventions, especially its use of medhya rasayanas (cognitive-enhancing herbs) and techniques like Abhyanga (therapeutic oil massage), Shirodhara, and meditation practices, are increasingly relevant in managing stress, anxiety, depression, and burnout. The government has supported mental wellness initiatives through AYUSH-based mindfulness programs in schools and workplaces. These interventions are not only cost-effective but also culturally congruent with Indian communities.
The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the institutionalization of Ayurveda within emergency health frameworks. The Ministry of AYUSH released official guidelines on immune-boosting Ayurvedic formulations like Ayush Kwath, Chyawanprash, and Guduchi, which were distributed widely across India. Additionally, integrative management protocols were developed for COVID-positive patients to include Ayurvedic therapies for improving immunity, reducing inflammation, and supporting respiratory function. These initiatives were backed by clinical studies and real-world data, which demonstrated the supportive role of Ayurvedic medicine in pandemic response and post-COVID care.
Despite these achievements, several challenges hinder the full-scale integration of Ayurveda into the mainstream health system. Key concerns include the standardization of Ayurvedic formulations, scientific validation through clinical trials, and interdisciplinary collaboration with biomedical sciences. 
Efforts are ongoing to bridge these gaps. Research institutions like the Central Council for Research in Ayurvedic Sciences (CCRAS) and AYUSH Research Portal are supporting large-scale clinical trials, meta-analyses, and documentation of traditional knowledge. Digitization of Ayurvedic manuscripts and pharmacopoeias is improving access to classical texts. Moreover, initiatives like Ayurveda Bioinformatics and AI-powered diagnostic tools are being developed to modernize Ayurvedic research and diagnostics. Regulatory frameworks are also evolving to ensure quality control, ethical practices, and safe integration into public systems.
The global interest in Ayurveda is steadily rising, especially in the context of preventive healthcare and personalized medicine. Many countries are exploring ways to incorporate Ayurveda into their wellness and healthcare offerings. The WHO has acknowledged India’s efforts by establishing the WHO Global Centre for Traditional Medicine in Gujarat, aiming to strengthen global evidence-based traditional medicine systems.
India’s experience in mainstreaming Ayurveda offers valuable lessons for other nations seeking to diversify their healthcare systems. By emphasizing community-based care, preventive strategies, and holistic principles, Ayurveda serves as a low-cost, scalable, and culturally sensitive model for improving public health outcomes. As global interest in Ayurveda grows, India's model serves as a blueprint for integrating traditional medicine into mainstream healthcare. By leveraging Ayurveda’s holistic principles, cost-effectiveness, and community-centered approach, public health systems worldwide can enhance preventive care and population health outcomes.";Public Health;.;This presentation aims to provide insights into India’s Ayurveda-based public health framework, emphasizing policy advancements, implementation strategies, and its potential role in global health systems.;"Publichealth; ayurveda; Integrative"

The Evidence Map on Aromatherapy Clinical Effectiveness containing 126 systematic reviews and meta-analyses demonstrates that this is a safe and effective therapy (https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/bireme/viz/aromaterapia-en/evidence-map). Essential oils are volatile substances extracted from botanical species, containing terpenic structures which have an action on the central nervous and biochemical systems. This protocol aims to provide immediate and emergency care to the population displaced from their homes due to the flooding climate disaster. It was developed by the author and applied to the flood that occurred in May 2024 in the southern region of Brazil, affecting more than 90% of the municipalities in the state of Rio Grande do Sul and more than 2 million people, becoming the largest disaster the region has ever suffered. The aromatherapy protocol was developed to be applied in public shelters, with families,  elderly aged 75 to 95, and for women and their children. This protocol was awarded first place by the Fondation Gattefossé in the AromaShow Case 2024 Innovative Humanitarian Aromatherapy Protocol Competition (https://www.fondation-gattefosse.org/en/projets/winner-aroma-protocol-for-flood-victims-in-brazil/).;"OBJECTIVE: To provide emotional support, minimize emotional trauma, reduce symptoms of anxiety and stress, sadness, fear, and improve sleep and well-being. 
POPULATION: 350 people was served, included children over 6 years old, teenagers, adults and seniors (CETE Shelter), seniors 75-95 years old (60+ Shelter), women and their children (Violet House Shelter).
METHODOLOGY: First step: inhalation of 1 drop of  sweet orange Citrus sinensis essential oil, on absorbent material (cotton or inverted adhesive-bandage), frequency 1x per week, duration 3 weeks (on average). Second step:  inhalation of 1 drop of  blend essential oil (1:1,  sweet orange Citrus sinensis and  tea tree Melaleuca alternifolia) on absorbent material (cotton or inverted adhesive-bandage), frequency 1x per week, duration 3 weeks (on average).
EVALUATION: The following items were evaluated: emotional improvement, reduction of symptoms of anxiety and stress, decrease in sadness and fear, improving sleep and promoting relaxation, improved well-being. The assessment was carried out by the aromatherapist and the multidisciplinary team at the shelter (responsible for integrative practices at the shelter, psychologist, physiotherapist, nursing assistant, nursing technician, social worker). It was asked the question to the sheltere: ""How are you feeling after using aromatherapy?"". Other assessment tools and protocols were not used due to the emergency care situation in this calamity.";"RESULTS: 98 to 99% of responses were positive regarding the improvement of the items evaluated.

RESEARCH BIAS:  these were the identified biases: (a) the sheltered person begins to accept the situation, (b) the prospect of returning to the home, (c) positive effect of access to doctors, medicines and food, (d) getting new clean clothes and blankets from donations, (e) receiving other integrative practices.";CONCLUSION: This aromatherapy protocol achieved the proposed objective: to provide emotional support, minimize emotional trauma, reduce symptoms of anxiety and stress, sadness, fear, and improve sleep and well-being. Aromatherapy is a viable and effective tool to be used in cases of catastrophes, calamities and extreme suffering (collective in large populations or individual).

The intervention aimed to promote personal well-being and psycho-spiritual comfort to the students. Music therapy is the use of music to help achieve a specific change in the behavior, feelings or physiology of human beings.1 Regarding the content of the intervention, some songs were pre-selected by the researchers and others were suggested by the students themselves. It is worth noting that the songs had varied structures, comprising different styles, rhythms and tones, with moderate tempos and little variability; most were in major mode, simple harmony and consonance. The musical presentation method was live, at a pleasant volume. Regarding the intervention materials, male and female human voices, digital piano and acoustic guitar were used. In some meetings, the students tried to play percussion instruments such as cajon or half-moon tambourine. The intervention strategies were listening to and recreating music, organized in monthly interactive group sessions lasting an average of 60 minutes over a period of one year. It is important to emphasize that the first author (nurse, musician and researcher in the area of music therapy as a nursing intervention) and the second author (musician) are responsible for the intervention. The fidelity of the treatment, which ensures control conditions, was attributed to the evaluation of seven professionals who monitored the socio-educators.2";Adolescents serving socio-educational measures that deprive and restrict freedom are subject to problems such as anxiety, social isolation and spiritual suffering, given that the period of internment can vary from six months to three years, with assessments every six months. In this context, nursing can use Integrative and Complementary Health Practices (ICHP). In fact, within the scope of the Nursing Care Systematization (NCS), music therapy is suggested for nursing diagnoses such as anxiety, social isolation and spiritual suffering, with the aim of achieving nursing outcomes such as personal well-being and psycho-spiritual comfort.3 By valuing the human rights of socio-educational students, in an attempt to contribute to their overcoming process, promoting citizenship and achieving assisted freedom, the project converges with the Socio-therapeutic intervention axis of the Intereducational Program for the comprehensive management of the resocialization and social reintegration of adolescents in conflict with the law4, which is fundamental for their success in the process of change and in the construction of a life project.;"During the project, ten music therapy sessions were held, involving 12 to 18 socio-educational students per session, all male, aged between 15 and 20. Gradually, the atmosphere of joy and relaxation took over the environment, noticeable through the exchange of glances, smiles and body posture, which became less rigid with each song; through the tapping of hands or clapping, following the rhythm of the music. It is important to record the interaction of the socio-educational students in the process of choosing the songs, respecting the collective appreciation, always choosing songs that the majority knew, liked and could sing along with the musicians. They chose songs that were peculiar to this phase of the life cycle, such as country songs, which talk about love or disappointments in love, or songs that portray their social reality (most of which were unknown to the musicians); songs that aroused emotions linked to past memories, when we could see eyes filled with tears; or gospel music, when they could express their spirituality and hope for better days. At the end of the sessions, they would thank us for being with them and for the music. They also asked for the sessions to be held weekly. According to the assessment of the seven SEAC professionals, music therapy can contribute to the process of achieving supervised freedom; reduce anxiety; favor social interaction and integration; promote mental health and well-being; awaken self-esteem and self-knowledge; promote psycho-spiritual comfort; stimulate creativity, communication and expressiveness; favor overcoming the difficulties faced; increase the chances of supervised freedom being achieved and avoid reoccurrences; promote social inclusion, guarantee equal opportunities and reduce inequalities in results; expand access to art and culture; contribute to positive change in the behavior of socio-educational inmates. For one of the professionals, “music makes them more sensitive and happy. This opens a path for positive thoughts and makes them better people, as it relieves stress and calms their minds”. The professionals also believe that the project contributed to their own well-being.";"The results presented suggest that music therapy promoted personal well-being and psycho-spiritual comfort to socio-educators and professionals; they can stimulate other initiatives; and contribute to the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) such as “Health and well-being”, “Reduction of inequalities” and “Art, Culture and Communication”, which aim to ensure a healthy life and promote mental health and well-being for all; promote social inclusion, guarantee equal opportunities and reduce inequalities in results; and ensure plurality and cultural freedom, democratization of art and inclusive communication for all.5";"Social Vulnerability; Social Marginalization; Adolescent; Music Therapy; Nursing Care"

RAVA is delegable and can be used by doctors and nurses. We have more than 5 years clinical experience using the RAVA-method (the majority of our patients have chronic pain disorders) and a study to our new ear-acupuncture method will start at the end of this year/ in the beginning of 2026. 
We have been training doctors throughout Germany for over 2 years now and the feedback is tremendously positive. 
RAVA is now used in emergency rooms, pain clinics, private outpatient clinics and even in gynecology and pediatrics departments.";"Most ear-acupuncture protocols consist of 5 standardized acupuncture-points or have no system at all (just a rough order of selecting a few ear-acupuncture points).
Therefore the RAVA semi-standardized method is new. 

It is to the patients and to the doctors satisfaction.
The patients benefit from the ear-acupuncture treatment and for in ear-acupuncture experienced doctors/ nurses it can be learned within one day. This is the advantage of combining 3 RAVA base-points with 2 individually selected ear-acupuncture points each ear.

The causal principle for the regulation and vitalization of the three RAVA base-points is based on the theory of the Triple Burner (San Jiao).
In fact, there are three theoretical concepts: The Triple Burner is either understood as one of the six hollow organs (6 Fu), as the “Road of Primordial-Qi (Yuan Qi)” or thirdly, as one of the three parts of the body.
In all of the three theories, the Triple Burner ensures “the correct direction of movement of all types of Qi in all parts of the body” (hence also of blood and other body fluids) and thus supports all other organs in their functions (prevents stagnation).
This means that if we treat the Triple Burner, we support every functional process of the body and that is why we are seeing a regulating effect. In addition, the Triple Burner positively influences the production, transport and conversion of Qi and therefore has a vitalizing effect.";"The RAVA-method combines three defined RAVA base-points of the ear with two individually selected ear acupuncture points. 
In the RAVA-protocol the Triple Burner is embodied/represented by the three base-points Shen Men, Sympathetic II and Liver.
In terms of their location and function, the three RAVA base-points derived from the NADA-method and were correlated with the Triple Burner system.
Shen Men (Fire, Heart) reflects the Upper, Sympathetic II (Earth, Spleen/Stomach) the Middle and Liver (Wood, Liver) the Lower Burner.
Moreover, according to theory, all three base-points have an overarching effect on the body and mind.";"By combining three base-points as causal therapy for body and mind and optionally two additional customizable ear acupuncture points, both chronic and acute symptoms can be treated at the same time.
RAVA is the combination of western physio-neurology of the ear with eastern TCM theory to create a new effective ear-acupuncture treatment.
In conclusion the RAVA-method is (didactically and clinically) a valuable addition to previously known ear acupuncture protocols.";"RAVA; ear-acupuncture; acupuncture; Triple Burner; semi-standardized method"

It is an expressive, traditional and contemporary body practice, through circle dancing. It has its origins in different cultures, which favors learning and harmonious connection between participants. In the dynamics, assistance is mutual, promoting human integration and equality, aiming at physical, mental, emotional and social well-being. The focus is not on technique, but rather on the feeling of unity, group and community. Impacts on physical and mental health are perceived, as dance works on balance and mobility. The psychological benefits point to the contribution of improving self-esteem and reducing symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress. This work aims to report the theoretical and practical experience of CD experienced by medical students, led by the Academic League of Integrative Medicine (ALIM) of a private Higher Education Institution (HEI). The League's goals include, for example, extending services to society arising from teaching and research activities and providing academics with a space to develop autonomy and leadership in the construction of scientific knowledge. The workshop took place in the IES auditorium on March 24, 2025. We began with a PowerPoint presentation (theoretical content) led by a trained and expert professor (focuser/facilitator), moderated by a university professor, which lasted approximately 40 minutes. The theoretical part addressed ICHP in general, as therapeutic resources that aim to prevent disease and restore health. The theoretical part covered ICHP in general, as therapeutic resources that seek to prevent diseases and restore health. The importance of listening attentively, developing a therapeutic bond and integrating human beings with the environment and society was emphasized. The definition of CD, its symbology, history, dancers’ positions and movements, among others, were discussed. The practical activity was then carried out, in which all 16 students participated and were able to experience two CDs. In the next 50 minutes we started the practical part of the DC, with the focalizer guided and explained the origin and meaning of each song and the respective choreography, and everyone positioned themselves in a circle. Then, everyone held hands and sat (CD in Chair) and danced “Lode Alla Montagna”, a song of Italian origin, whose intention was to awaken awareness of the journey through life, the need for help at certain times and the reconstruction with love and gratitude. Then, everyone stood, holding hands in a circle and danced “Hear the Joy”, a traditional Hebrew song, whose intention was hear the joy, celebrate the joy, share your joy of being here at this moment, all of us together. 
";"The daily academic life of medical students is very demanding, so it is essential that they learn about and develop practices that help reduce anxiety and maintain a balanced mental health. With adequate emotional support, it is possible to promote health, reducing exhaustion and even burnout syndrome. By acquiring knowledge of self-care strategies and practices, students expand the possibilities of providing comprehensive and humanized care to their patients. The integration of the management of a conventional model with other rationalities facilitates the understanding of the different systems or ways of understanding, diagnosing and treating diseases within the field of medicine. The concept of medical rationalities recognizes that there are several ways of thinking about and practicing medicine, each with its own internal logic, beliefs, techniques and forms of care. It is worth mentioning that the ICHP, and in this case CD, aimed to include a therapeutic approach to integrate and complement the health of students, pointing out another path towards the logic of humanized care.
";"After the dynamic we developed the following guiding question for the feedback of the activity: How did you feel participating in the CD practice? All 16 students who participated in the dynamic assessment responded by describing the impact of the experience. We selected some reports: “This experience also helped me increase my body awareness and strengthen my mind-body connection...”; “The practical class was incredible, it was inspiring. I felt lighter and more connected to myself. I loved the way that the technique was not so much demanded, but rather the inclusion of everyone. I hope to take everything I learned today into my life and do my best to share it with other people, so that they feel exactly what I felt in this class”. “The CD made me feel close to my classmates. Today I was a little irritated and I felt very happy and excited, I even forgot about the stress...; “I really enjoyed the class, and especially the practical part...”; “I think there was a nice exchange of energies. Medical school demands a lot of time from our day and a lot from our mental and physical health”; “I brought back a childhood memory. Today I felt happy and how this interaction away from social media makes a difference”; “Such practices always help to bring lightness to our daily lives. In addition to opening our eyes and horizons so that we can already introduce our future routine of medical practice”. According to the reports presented, we believe that CD contributed significantly to awakening respect for others, affection for oneself and others, in addition to promoting improved self-esteem. Because it is performed in a group and with hands held, DC favored the circulation of positive energy, which, as pointed out in some testimonies, can even be perceived as therapeutic. The results suggest that CD promoted the students' physical, mental, emotional, and social well-being. Furthermore, reports indicate benefits in improving self-esteem and reducing symptoms of anxiety and stress.
";"To enhance these benefits, we recommend the active involvement of teachers and professionals in the field, integrating these practices into the academic context on an ongoing basis. We also suggest creating shared spaces for exchanging experiences, allowing students to express their perceptions and enhance the positive impact of Circle Dance and other practices that stimulate body movement, relaxation and personal interaction.

Auriculotherapy is a therapeutic technique that promotes psychophysical regulation of the individual through stimulation of specific points located on the auricular pavilion. Evidence has reinforced its high patient acceptability, safety, and effectiveness, with positive effects on physical, psychological, and mental disorders. It can be used both as a preventive and therapeutic intervention.
Aiming to increase the number of trained professionals in auriculotherapy within primary care and to expand the population’s access to this therapeutic resource, the Municipal Auriculotherapy Protocol was published in November 2022. In January 2023, a partnership was established with the Federal University of Santa Catarina (UFSC) to provide professional training in auriculotherapy, designating the municipality as a Practical Training Hub. The practical stage was supported by the Center for Mindfulness and Integrative Therapies (CEMIT) of the University of São Paulo at Ribeirão Preto College of Nursing (EERP-USP), which provided logistical and structural support.";The implementation of auriculotherapy in Ribeirão Preto’s SUS revealed several challenges, such as the need for continuous and ongoing professional education, regular acquisition of materials, and adjustments in care routines to ensure the effective incorporation of the practice by municipal professionals. Service adherence required support from local management, team engagement, intersectoral articulation within SMS-RP, and dissemination of the practice to the community.;"Ribeirão Preto was designated as a hub for the practical activities of two editions of the training course, held in May 2023 and June 2024. The target audience included Primary Health Care professionals, multidisciplinary teams in basic care, home care, street clinics, and Psychosocial Care Centers (CAPS). A total of 463 spots were offered, with 245 reserved for professionals from Ribeirão Preto and the remaining 218 open to professionals from other regions of Brazil. All spots allocated to the municipality were filled; however, 165 professionals (67%) completed all training stages and were certified.
After two years of training, the number of professionals qualified in auriculotherapy in the municipal network increased by 546%, from 37 in 2022 to 202 in 2024. The number of health units offering auriculotherapy grew by 700%, from 6 in 2022 to 42 in 2024, covering 66.7% of the 63 eligible units. The number of auriculotherapy procedures registered in the municipal information system increased by 430%, from 2,189 in 2022 to 9,417 in 2024. The practice began to be offered both individually and in group settings, benefiting people with diabetes, chronic pain and temporomandibular joint dysfunction (TMJ), smoking cessation needs, anxiety, depression, as well as healthcare professionals within the services.";"The experience in Ribeirão Preto demonstrates viable pathways for expanding PICS within the municipal SUS, emphasizing professional training, regulation of practice, intersectoral articulation, and financing. This initiative enabled expanded access to auriculotherapy in a safe manner, based on national guidelines and aligned with the 2022 Municipal Protocol, which served as a key facilitator of the process. Continuing education has proven to be a powerful tool for team engagement and for enhancing the quality of auriculotherapy care.
Identified challenges include the need to sustain training actions, ensure the continuous acquisition of supplies, and improve monitoring and evaluation strategies, thereby promoting comprehensive, humanized, and interprofessional care within the territory.";"Auriculotherapy; health training; Complementary Therapies"

As integrative medicine advances, there is increasing recognition that effective health promotion requires individuals to take an active role in shaping their own well-being. Consciousness-Based Integrative Preventive Medicine (CBIPM) offers a novel, evidence-informed framework that synthesizes insights from consciousness science, energy and information theory, quantum physics, neuroplasticity, and Antonovsky’s salutogenic model. This approach aims to cultivate multidimensional wellness by activating inner healing resources and fostering coherence, meaning, and self-directed health behaviors.
Objective:
To evaluate the feasibility, participant experience, and perceived impact of a pilot community-based educational program grounded in CBIPM principles, designed to enhance health literacy and promote holistic well-being.";"A seven-week online course was delivered to 63 adult participants, consisting of 14 sessions combining theoretical instruction and experiential learning. The curriculum integrated consciousness-based and salutogenic principles across the following core topics:
1.	Introduction to CBIPM: Holism, wellness, self-regulation, and self-healing
2.	Energy, Information, and Health: Bridging ancient wisdom and modern science
3.	Quantum Physics, Consciousness, and Health: Exploring energy–awareness interconnections
4.	Redefining Health and Illness through a Consciousness-Based Lens
5.	Life Events, Trauma, and Illness: Meaning-making and integration
6.	The Nature of Healing in a Consciousness-Based Framework
7.	Salutogenesis and Neuroplastic Reprogramming for Optimal Well-being
Experiential components included guided meditation, breathwork, energy healing techniques(e.g., Emotional Freedom Techniques, gut, heart, brain coherence training), and practice in small group.";"Results:
Quantitative course evaluations indicated high participant satisfaction: content value (mean score 4.7/5), professionalism (4.9/5), and overall satisfaction (4.7/5). Qualitative feedback revealed increased emotional clarity, spiritual growth, energy awareness, and empowerment. Several participants described the program as “transformational,” citing enhanced self-regulation, expanded perspective, and deeper connection to self and others. Notably, over one-third expressed interest in continuing group sessions to further integrate the material and practices.";"This pilot implementation of CBIPM demonstrates strong feasibility, high participant engagement, and positive short-term outcomes in terms of self-perceived transformation across emotional, mental, physical, and spiritual domains. By promoting a proactive, consciousness-based model of preventive medicine, CBIPM shifts the focus from disease avoidance to the cultivation of vitality, coherence, and meaning. These findings suggest that CBIPM may serve as a scalable, community-centered approach to public health education. Further research is warranted to evaluate long-term effects, optimize delivery methods, and assess applicability across diverse populations and cultural contexts.

Lazarov Skin Cancer Clinic - Israel;;Sim;Sim;Não;Sim;-;;;;-;;The Healing Field: A Consciousness-Based Model of Group Energy Healing in Cancer Care;Cancer patients and survivors often face emotional, existential, and social challenges beyond physical illness. Emerging evidence suggests that group-based interventions can foster compassion, spiritual healing, and resilience, offering benefits beyond symptom reduction. Holistic practices such as group meditation, qi gong, and energy-based therapies may align participants within a shared biofield or collective consciousness, facilitating access to a more adaptive sense of identity and meaning. Resonance and neural entrainment between the biofield and the nervous system are proposed mechanisms underlying observed psychological and physiological improvements. Biofield therapies have been shown to reduce pain, anxiety, fatigue, and distress in cancer patients, while enhancing emotional resilience, relaxation, and spiritual well-being.;"Considering this growing body of knowledge on the therapeutic potential of group energy work, we developed a consciousness-based group energy healing program (2020–2025) to support cancer patients and their communities through integrative, mind-body-spirit care.
Each group formed around a patient with advanced cancer—glioblastoma, osteosarcoma, metastatic breast cancer, B-cell lymphoma, or pancreatic cancer—and included up to 13 participants, such as family, friends, and volunteers. The intervention combined weekly Zoom-based sessions with twice-weekly synchronized distance healing, co-facilitated by a medical doctor trained in clinical EFT and energy healing, and an experienced energy healer.
Unlike traditional support groups that primarily emphasize emotional expression and verbal processing, this consciousness-based group healing model is grounded in the premise that healing may emerge through the collective alignment of consciousness, intentionality, and subtle energy fields. Rather than focusing solely on narrative sharing, the group experience is designed to cultivate a resonant energetic environment that supports transformation on emotional, physical, and spiritual levels. Each session began with mind–body practices—such as conscious breathing, Emotional Freedom Techniques (EFT) tapping, and Qigong—to promote somatic awareness, relaxation, and energetic balance. These were followed by participant-led creative contributions, including poetry readings, group singing, and the sharing of meaningful visual media. These elements served to foster emotional connection, cultivate positive affect, and create a sense of shared humanity and joy within the group.
The central component of each session involved the co-creation of healing intentions that were individually tailored to the specific needs of the patient for whom the group was formed. These intentions were then woven into guided meditations, offered both during the live online sessions and through remote group practices conducted synchronously twice a week. This multidimensional process allowed participants to engage with the field of healing not only through presence and empathy, but through a sustained, intentional energetic connection. The combination of group coherence, spiritual focus, and sustained attention to healing intentions provided a unique therapeutic container that appeared to support deep inner shifts among both patients and participants.
";Participants reported reduced anxiety, enhanced emotional resilience, and improved self-regulation of treatment side effects, alongside greater trust in their holistic healing process. Many noted heightened sensitivity to the shared energy field and a deeper sense of body–mind–spirit integration. Clinical improvements were observed in several patients, including three documented remissions. Notably, the glioblastoma centered group has continued for over five years—remarkable given the average survival of 12–18 months. Increased creativity, emotional openness, and interpersonal connection among all the participants were also frequently reported.;"This model demonstrates the potential of group-based intentional energy healing to complement conventional oncology care. It offers a reproducible, consciousness-based framework for integrative practitioners, with promising implications for addressing psychoneuroimmunological dynamics and the biofield in chronic and oncologic conditions.

This initiative aligns with the National Policy on Integrative and Complementary Practices (PNPIC), published on 3 May 2006, and is celebrated annually in May, encouraging participation from civil society organisations and specialised institutions through lectures, workshops, and therapeutic experiences.
In 2023 and 2024, the PICS Coordination I of the Municipal Health Department of Ribeirão Preto, in partnership with civil society sectors and local institutions, organised a month-long programme in May focused on workers’ health. The activities included therapeutic interventions, workshops, experiential sessions, and dialogue circles, offering support and self-care spaces for healthcare professionals. Studies have shown that PICS not only support improvements in the physical and mental health of professionals but also play a crucial role in reducing stress, increasing resilience, and improving quality of life in the workplace. This experience reaffirms the municipal administration's commitment to integrative public policies and to valuing SUS workers, pointing towards the strengthening of comprehensive healthcare within the local territory.";Attention to workers’ health is a continuous and increasingly essential demand, particularly in light of prolonged exposure to stress, workload, and emotional impact, which compromise individual well-being and quality of life.;"Over the course of these two years, the activities held during the month of May reached a total of 795 participants, with 1,477 PICS procedures performed. The services offered included Reiki and energy healing, meditation and mindfulness, aromatherapy, flower essence therapy, discussion circles on myths and truths in herbal medicine, massage, reflexology, foot soaks, systemic acupuncture, auriculotherapy, biodanza, circle dancing, yoga, tai chi chuan, and systemic constellations.
In addition to activities held in health units, the schedule also included external theoretical-practical events such as a roundtable on “The Integration of PICS in Public Health”, the launch of the “Reiki Protocol of SMS-RP”, a live broadcast on “Salutogenesis: reclaiming your human health potential”, a webinar on the “Implementation of PICS in Different Municipalities in São Paulo State”, and a photo exhibition titled “Gardens of Health”, showcasing green spaces within the city’s health units.
Noteworthy is the articulation with partner institutions such as the Centre for Mindfulness and Integrative Therapies of EERP-USP, LAEPIC – Academic League of PICS of EERP-USP, and the Reikilibra USP Project – EERP-USP. There was also broad participation from civil society, with over 40 hours of voluntary services, therapeutic kits, and workshops donated. Care actions directed at healthcare professionals make this population more visible and promote their integration and health, even through punctual interventions.";"The experience of the “2nd Municipal Week of PICS” demonstrated that providing such activities in the workplace can be a powerful strategy for promoting health and well-being, fostering integration among healthcare workers, civil society, and educational institutions, while disseminating these practices, broadening access, and increasing healthcare professionals’ knowledge about PICS. It also offers new perspectives on health care.
Moreover, incorporating these practices into the work environment strengthens the sense of self-care and encourages a healthier, more collaborative organisational culture.";"health promotion; Occupational Health; Complementary Therapies"

It’s not a diagnosis—it’s not even abnormal. It’s human. We all experience brainwave dysregulation at some point: during stress, after trauma, through burnout, illness, or simply living in an overstimulated, always-on world. The difference is this: some brains return to balance. Others get stuck—and when dysregulation becomes persistent, it silently disrupts everything else.
That’s the missing layer in most integrative models. Many systems address trauma, sleep, nutrition, and nervous system support. But “supporting the nervous system” often means using indirect inputs—like breathwork, manual therapies, or supplements—that don’t measure or directly shift the dysregulated brainwaves.
This model uses qEEG brain mapping and neurofeedback to bring those patterns into focus—then shift them. It’s not therapy. It’s not pharmaceutical. And it doesn’t require a diagnosis. It’s a measurable feedback system that helps the brain learn to better regulate.
In this model, we start with a quantitative EEG (qEEG)—a “brain map” showing real-time patterns in brainwave activity. These aren’t guesses or symptom checklists. We’re looking directly at how the brain functions. The maps often match what clients already know in their bodies: “I feel anxious but can’t shut it off,” “I’m tired but wired,” “I’ve done all the work and still feel stuck.” When the brain map confirms what they’ve been feeling, they move from self-blame to direction—and that’s when the shift begins.
With data in hand, we create a custom training protocol that helps brainwaves shift out of stuck patterns and learn to better regulate.";"Most wellness systems do meaningful work—supporting nutrition, sleep, trauma recovery, and lifestyle. But many miss the deeper, electrical patterns running silently beneath it all. Brainwave dysregulation—too much fast activity, too little alpha, hemispheric imbalance—goes unmeasured in most care models.
As a result, clients do “everything right” and still feel stuck. They try new diets, see new therapists, commit to healing practices—and still don’t shift. Not because they’re doing something wrong, but because their brain is still running a survival pattern that none of those tools can touch.
Without looking at brainwaves, the real issue remains hidden. When we don’t see it, we can’t help improve negative symptoms.";"The process is gentle and non-invasive. Clients sit quietly while their brain receives feedback—through visual or audio cues—based on its own activity in real time. No performance. No overthinking. Just feedback, session by session, rhythm by rhythm. Because the feedback is tied to what we saw in the brain map, the brain learns to shift in exactly the way it needs to.
This model is implemented in multiple settings:
In-Person Intensives: High-frequency, 5-day retreats begin and end with qEEG maps. Visible shifts in brainwave function often correlate with improved sleep, mood, clarity, and emotional regulation.
Virtual @Home Programs: Clients train remotely using portable systems with structured case management, check-ins, and progress tracking. This model increases access while maintaining data integrity.
Functional Wellness & Coaching Practices: Practitioners integrate neurofeedback to move clients past blocks talk-based or lifestyle interventions can’t fully address.
Across all formats, the results are consistent: when brainwave regulation improves, other strategies begin to work better. We've seen clients who’ve “tried everything” finally experience meaningful shifts—physiologically and cognitively—once they began better regulating their brainwaves.
One remote user client, a 15-year-old male with absence seizures and attention challenges, experienced a 57% improvement in brain function with major reductions in impulsivity and a drop in his metabolic score from 36 to 1—indicating better neurological and systemic regulation.
During an intensive experience (neurofeedback combined with Shamanic Energy Work in 4 day period), a 53-year-old woman with a history of anxiety, depression, and chronic fatigue showed a 38% shift in brain function, with improved attention, emotional regulation, and a drop in her metabolic score from 272 to 37.
Another participant, a 60-year-old woman dealing with inhibition and impulsivity, completed an intensive and showed a 40% improvement in her qEEG with notable shifts in mood regulation, attention, and overall metabolic health.
These results are measurable, meaningful, and often correlate with improved emotional flexibility, better sleep, and increased clarity. Not because neurofeedback solved everything, but because it shifted the internal state that was blocking progress everywhere else.";"This model solves four core problems in integrative and wellness care:
1. Dysregulation Goes Unseen
When brainwave activity isn’t measured, providers often miss one of the most foundational contributors to lack of progress. 
qEEG makes the invisible visible and offers a measurable training path forward.
2. Clients Are Doing the Work—But Still Struggling
When the brain is dysregulated, even the best strategies don’t work.
It helps the brain shift into a more flexible, stable, and integrated state—so clients can access what they already know.
3. Generic Care Misses What’s Actually Needed
Most interventions are built around symptoms—not brain function.
Each protocol is based on a person’s brain map and adapts as they progress.
4. Not Enough Providers Know How to Use It
Even as awareness grows, access remains limited. Too few practitioners are trained, equipped, and confident in how to measure and support brainwave regulation.
It offers a scalable, non-clinical way to bring brain-based support into real-world care—without requiring a diagnosis or prescription.
This model supports TCIM values: self-regulation over suppression, adaptability across modalities, and empowerment through real-time feedback. It doesn’t compete with other approaches. It stabilizes the system so everything else can work better.
When we finally measure what’s going on in the brain, we stop guessing and we start shifting.";"brainwaves; dysregulation; neurofeedback; Integrative; measurable"

This is an initiative developed by the Research Laboratory in Epidemiology and Social Determinants of Health of the Evandro Chagas National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID) at Fiocruz, in Rio de Janeiro. The objective of this work was to describe the implementation of the ""1st Reiki Level I Training Course for Community Health Promoters."" The aim was to generate knowledge on health promotion strategies and, simultaneously, document the experiences and impact of the active participation of citizens in situations of social vulnerability. The motivation for the design and implementation of this course lies in the commitment to Well-Being and Health, directly aligned with the 3rd Sustainable Development Goal of the United Nations 2030 Agenda. It is believed that the promotion of comprehensive health is a fundamental pillar for social development. A qualitative, descriptive, and exploratory methodology was used to present the Reiki technique, a practice recognized by the Brazilian Ministry of Health since 2017, which aims to achieve energetic balance. A Reiki master led the activities, and 13 community members and leaders, designated as Community Health Promoters (CHPs), attended the course. This group consisted of people living with HIV, Chagas disease, breast cancer, other neoplasms, anxiety, and depression. In addition to the CHPs, two healthcare professionals also participated in the course, enriching the exchange of experiences. The diversity of participants contributed significantly to the richness of the discussions and experiences provided by the course.";The course was designed in response to the significant social and health challenges faced by the communities where the participants live. The intervention takes place in a context of social vulnerability, which justifies its relevance and impact. The CHPs who participated in the course live in communities frequently marked by territorial conflicts and high rates of violence. This environment of constant insecurity has a profound impact on individuals' health and well-being, contributing to chronic stress, anxiety, and other mental health conditions. Continuous exposure to risky situations compromises quality of life and the ability to self-care, making it essential to develop strategies that promote resilience and well-being amidst adversity. The population served by the project faces a considerable burden of psychological distress. Anxiety and stress disorders are prevalent, affecting the ability to cope with illness, treatment adherence, and overall quality of life. A contemporary and relevant problem is the spread of fake news, including ICHP, such as Reiki. This misinformation can generate skepticism and resistance, preventing citizens from seeking or benefiting from complementary therapeutic approaches that could improve their health and well-being. The successful implementation of the course was ensured by the institutional support of Faperj and the INOVA/FiopromoS/Fiocruz Program, which provided the necessary resources and adequate infrastructure for the implementation of the proposed activities. Therefore, the course flowed satisfactorily, without incidents or difficulties in its implementation.;"The course was held in May 2024, lasting a total of 16 hours, in the classroom of the NIID's Vice-Director of Education. The training followed Mikao Usui's traditional Reiki system, considered the decoder of the practice, covering the fundamentals of Reiki, self-application techniques, application positions, and the internalization of the five Reiki principles: ""Just for today, do not be angry, do not worry, be grateful, work honestly, and be kind to all beings."" One of the key indicators of this intervention's success was the full adherence of the 15 participants, who accepted and completed the Reiki Level I training. This demonstrates the group's high level of interest and engagement with the course. The 100% completion rate attests to the perceived relevance of the content and methodology applied, as well as the commitment of the CHPs to their personal development and health promotion within their networks. Self-application and Reiki exchange practices were conducted among the participants, allowing everyone to experience the Reiki energy and develop their practical skills. At the end of the training, we received reports that verbalized the positive impact of the experience. The narratives converged on feelings of ""balance,"" ""harmony,"" and ""energetic strengthening"" promoted by Reiki. One of the most important lessons learned from this experience is the power of practical experience and direct community engagement in promoting health.";The results of this course suggest the continuation and expansion of similar initiatives. The experience reinforces the potential of Reiki not only as a self-care tool but also as a catalyst for community empowerment and the promotion of a culture of well-being. To maximize the impact of Reiki training, it is recommended that this model be replicated in other community groups. Involving community groups in disseminating the technique helps expand Reiki's reach and visibility, as well as promote knowledge. This dissemination, based on real experiences and the testimonies of beneficiaries, is a powerful way to produce and build new knowledge. It is emphasized that reporting this experience can contribute to the improvement of public policies and contribute to the effective integration of Reiki into primary care. The potential of newly trained Reiki practitioners as a tool to strengthen mutual aid networks among members of the PSC communities is recognized.;"Reiki; health promotion; Community Participation"

Open-ended questions were applied to qualitatively assess the reported outcomes. Results indicate increased self-awareness, stress reduction, and improved workplace interactions. Findings suggest that integrating short, accessible mindfulness practices into daily routines can foster personal and professional well-being.

The ""Projeto Respira"" introduced brief mindfulness exercises into the routines of employees and educators across four settings. Conducted in the city of São Paulo, state of São Paulo, Brazil, the sessions were held weekly, lasting 30 minutes, and combined micro-practice with a socio-emotional reflection.

This level of care, due to its attributes of longitudinality, comprehensiveness, care coordination, and low technological density (STARFIELD, 2002), combined with its emphasis on health promotion and disease prevention, offers a fertile ground for Integrative and Complementary Practices (PICS).

In 2022, with the implementation of a new multidisciplinary team at Walter Elias Primary Health Care Unit, located in the Northern Zone of São Paulo, the cross-cutting incorporation of PICS into care plans began. This initiative aligned with the concept of the Expanded Clinical Approach (CAMPOS, 2003), aiming to broaden the therapeutic scope beyond the traditional biomedical model, address the complexity of health needs in a complementary manner, and strengthen users' autonomy through supported self-care practices (WHO, 2013).

Currently, the Walter Elias PHC Unit has a multidisciplinary team (e-multi) composed of a physical therapist, psychologist, nutritionist, and social worker, in addition to the medical, nursing, and dental teams.

Among the collective care offerings, PICS stand out in group activities such as: ""Introduction to Homeopathy"", led by a homeopathic doctor; ""Integrative Health Workshop"" (featuring Integrative Community Therapy - ICT for adults and older adults, as well as Circle Dances, led by the physical therapist, the psychologist and the nutritionist); Tai Chi Pai Lin, led by a nurse; Meditation led by the nutritionist and the physical therapist; Body Practices and Self-Massage led by the physical therapist; ICT Circles for adolescents, and ICT Circles for children, both led by the psychologist.

In addition to group practices, the unit also offers individual PICS modalities, such as Homeopathy consultations, by the homeopathic doctor, and Auriculotherapy, by the physical therapist, the psychologist and the nutritionist. Access to these practices varies: while groups like Introduction to Homeopathy, the Integrative Health Workshop, Tai Chi Pai Lin, Meditation, and Body Practices and Self-Massage are open to all users in the territory, access to other ICT Circles (for adolescents and children) and individual practices occurs through prior assessment and referral by a health professional, based on the user’s specific health needs at the time.

Even for open practices, the health team may refer users to one or more specific PICS based on their health conditions and needs, so these can be integrated into their therapeutic and care plans in PHC.

Thus, the access pathway combines spontaneous demand with qualified referral, ensuring that PICS are integrated into care plans in a personalized manner, in line with the principles of comprehensive care (MATTOS, 2004).";The implementation of PICS at Walter Elias PHC Unit focused on the main health needs identified in the territory, particularly those sensitive to primary care. With a predominance of elderly residents, the main care demands include chronic conditions such as hypertension and diabetes, chronic pain, mobility preservation, fall prevention, physical inactivity, mental distress, encouragement of social participation, and reduction of social isolation. In child and adolescent care, issues related to mental suffering, depression, anxiety, and socialization also stand out.;"Following the inclusion of PICS in Primary Health Care plans, two main outcomes emerged at the Walter Elias PHC Unit. In terms of user profiles, there was significant engagement from the elderly population, with a noticeable improvement in socialization, reduction of isolation, and the strengthening of social bonds that extended beyond the health unit into the broader community. Involvement in PICS also enhanced user engagement with their self-care and other health initiatives offered by the unit.

In contrast, for children and adolescents, participation was limited, mainly due to their dependency on the availability of parents or guardians, who are often engaged in work routines during service hours.

Finally, the integration of PICS into the care routines of the unit has also led to a gradual cultural shift within the service—both among users, who have started to see the PHC unit as a place for health creation, rather than just a source of consultations, referrals, and prescriptions, and among professionals, who are increasingly recognizing the value of non-biomedical therapeutic approaches for both patient care and their own self-care.

This experience, ultimately, represents a successful example of the practical implementation of the PNPIC principles, by articulating traditional and scientific knowledge (FILICE, 2018), and demonstrates how Primary Health Care can operationalize this public policy in everyday practice—especially in urban settings.";"This experience revealed important structural and cultural challenges in fully implementing PICS within primary care.

The care culture of the PHC unit still reflects a predominantly biomedical model. Without structured institutional support, the process relied heavily on the leadership of the multidisciplinary team, whose work is grounded in interdisciplinarity and the Expanded Clinical Approach. However, limited team communication, few opportunities for matrix support, and the absence of regular interprofessional meetings made it difficult to coordinate care flows and shared therapeutic plans.

Most PICS training was acquired through individual effort and self-funded. The psychologist, physical therapist, and homeopathic doctor obtained various certifications independently, while the municipal health department supported training in Meditation, Tai Chi, and Auriculotherapy for the nutritionist, nurse, and physical therapist.

Initial user expectations also posed a barrier, as many were unfamiliar with PICS and expected conventional approaches. Overcoming this required ongoing health education and dialogue.

There were also infrastructure limitations, especially for group activities. As a response, the team partnered with community spaces outside the PHC unit to carry out some practices.

While the initiative and engagement of the multidisciplinary team were crucial for the initial implementation of PICS, their long-term consolidation and expansion across the health network require greater institutional support. Advancing in this direction involves investing in ongoing professional education on integrative practices, strengthening internal communication and care coordination among health workers, and supporting interprofessional collaboration. These efforts are essential to ensure the effective and sustainable incorporation of PICS into routine care, as outlined in the PNPIC, and to promote a broader transformation of health care within Brazil's Unified Health System.";"Práticas Integrativas e Complementares; Atenção Primária à Saúde; comprehensive health care"

Anthroposophic External Therapies (TEAn) are integrative practices that aim to promote health and well-being through external therapeutic stimuli, such as compresses, baths, massages and glide techniques. This project aimed to implement the service and train professionals (staff and volunteers) to apply TEAn in health units in the Federal District, integrating them into the Unified Health System (SUS). The initiative sought to expand the population's access to complementary practices, strengthen the training of health professionals and promote the humanization of care.

METHODS
The project was developed along four main axes:
1. Training: Conducting a theoretical-practical-experiential course, with a workload of 80 (eighty) hours, taught by guest professors specialized in Anthroposophy (TEAn).
2. Implementation: Introduction of TEAn was implemented in 11 (eleven) health units, with the acquisition of materials, audiovisual recording of the practices for future dissemination and publication of 04 (four) textbooks. The initial strategy focused on the application of TEAn to the staff of the units involved, aiming at engagement and sustainability. 
3. Dissemination: Publication of educational materials (books and videos), making it possible to replicate in other units and regions. 
4. Research: a qualitative research was designed, which is underway, in the implemented units to evaluate the effectiveness of the practices and the perception of professionals and users. 
The project was a partnership between Fiocruz-Brasília, the State Department of Health of the Federal District (SES/DF) and the Chamber of Deputies, for the research we also had the partnership of the Brazilian Academic Consortium of Integrative Practices (CABSIN).";"DISCUSSION
The implementation of TEANs in the SUS-DF proved to be viable and beneficial, both for users and for health professionals. The partnership with institutions such as Fiocruz-Brasília, the Chamber of Deputies and CABSIN was fundamental to the success of the project. The ongoing qualitative research will provide valuable insights for the expansion and improvement of practices. The availability of thematic videos and books will contribute to the dissemination of knowledge and the sustainability of the project.
The project rescued the possibility of a natural and integrative treatment for human beings. It was observed that the number of visits by users to the different specialties reduced the demand for medical appointments, reducing the burden on the Unified Health System, and also reducing the travel of these patients.
The experiential part of the training, for both staff and users, provoked commitment from the participants, which was initially low, at times.
The participation of volunteers in the training course allowed the involvement of the community, producing autonomy, involving them and increasing this partnership, giving sustainability to the project and practice. We are well aware of the difficulty management has in maintaining a new service.
Volunteers were also given a three-month financial aid to strengthen the implementation of the practice and the maintenance of the service in the units involved.
With the formation of the support network - composed of all employees and volunteers, teachers and coordinators of the Integrative Practice in Health: Anthroposophy Applied to Health of the SES-DF - it was possible to strengthen implementation actions, find solutions in the work of the TEAn, involve the community and unit staff, materials, difficulties with patients, issues with local or regional management. This was done through the exchange of experiences, preparation of documents, calling of meetings, etc.
Greater humanization of care was provided, improving the user-server relationship, whether in individual care or in the implementation of awareness-raising and instruction workshops for TEAn.
There was an increase in user awareness and responsibility in their health-disease process, resulting in greater participation in self-care and commitment to the entire treatment.
Last but not least, there was a recovery and empowerment of traditional practices known to the population, now systematized and based on Anthroposophy.

                                                                                                                                       ‘Thought not lived is thought dead’
                                                                                                                                                                                  Rudolf Steiner
RESULTS
1. Training: 43 (forty-three) professionals were certified by Fiocruz, demonstrating high satisfaction with the course and increased theoretical and practical knowledge, confirmed by self-assessment and evaluation of the course by participants.
2. Implementation: The TEAn were successfully integrated into 11 (eleven) health units, at the three levels of care, two of which were in rural areas, with reports of improved user well-being and greater engagement by professionals.
3. Dissemination: The four published books are being used as reference material, and the videos of the practices are in the editing phase to be made available to employees (all practices) and users (the simplest practices to perform), and also for ongoing training.
4. Qualitative Research: Preliminary results indicate that the TEAn are well accepted by users and professionals, standing out as an effective and low-cost complementary approach.";"CONCLUSIONS
The project showed that the training and implementation of TEAn in the SUS-DF are effective strategies to promote the integration of complementary practices in the public health system, with the potential to improve the quality of care and reduce costs. Continuity and replication in other regions can strengthen the provision of integrative care, improve the quality of life of the population and strengthen public policies for integrative health.";The implementation of integrative therapies in public services faces multidimensional challenges: management turnover compromises the continuity of projects, while lack of knowledge and prejudice about TCIM lead to the deprioritization of these practices. Managers often reallocate qualified professionals to other areas, interrupting consolidated services and depriving the population of humanized therapies that have been proven to improve health and self-care. This institutional instability, combined with the lack of appreciation for integrative practices, results in wasted resources already invested in training and weakens the comprehensiveness of care. Overcoming these obstacles requires strategies for continuous awareness-raising among managers, systematic documentation of results, and the creation of institutional mechanisms that protect these initiatives from political discontinuity.;"Anthroposophy; Unified Health System; Health Policy; Professional Training; Health Education"

It is implemented by students in the final period of the technical and technology courses in Massage Therapy at IFPR.

Abstract
The Brazilian Network of Health-Promoting Universities (REBRAUPS) began in 2018 and is formed by public and private higher education institutions, including the Federal University of Paraná. REBRAUPS is part of a global movement called Health-Promoting Universities (UPS) that began in the late 20th century, resulting mainly from the developments of the Health Promotion Charters. This movement encourages actions for a healthy academic environment, considering the different lifestyles and health needs of individuals who live in the same space. In the context of a UPS, institutions are expected to commit to the quality of life and well-being of the community, acting through training, education and health promotion services, in a pleasant physical and social environment, where skills and behaviors focused on self-care are encouraged. The National Policy for Integrative and Complementary Health Practices (PNPIC), in force since 2006, enables multidisciplinary services focused on health promotion in healthcare settings and also advocates the importance of research and training of new professionals in this area, encouraging partnerships with educational institutions. Massage therapy is a practice with a strong preventive component, helping to manage conditions such as muscle tension, chronic pain, and stress-related disorders. The integration of integrative practices into public health reflects a paradigmatic shift in the approach to care, moving away from focusing exclusively on curing diseases to adopting a more preventive and comprehensive model. This paper reports preliminary data from an intervention with massage therapy carried out on the community that passes through the spaces of a Health Promoting University. This is a project in partnership between two federal public institutions, the Instituto Federal do Paraná (IFPR) and the Universidade Federal do Paraná (UFPR), in the city of Curitiba. In the proposal, students of the technical and technology courses in Massage Therapy at IFPR practice some of the massage techniques included in the course curriculum, such as Quick-massage (chair massage), Shiatsu, Manual Lymphatic Drainage and Foot Reflexology, in the community linked to UFPR. The services began in 2024, during the second academic semester. The services, carried out in the Nursing and Occupational Therapy sector of UFPR, took place in the evening, from 7:15 pm to 10 pm, twice a week, over the course of 5 months. As a preliminaryl results, in terms of quantitative aspects, a total of 298 services were recorded, with 190 people served and 119 are part of UFPR and others 71 are from the external community. This project points out that the assignment of integrative practices in the context of UPS can strengthen the assumptions of health promotion policies in the country, as well as the objectives of UPS, increasing the number of services if we consider the number of people involved in academic spaces, thus expanding the network of services to the population in a space that educates, raises awareness and, above all, promotes health. Aspects considered relevant in this short period of the project were the participants' positive reception of the techniques, the significant number of sessions, and the opportunity to promote health in practice while mobilizing the professional development of massage therapy students. Furthermore, the compatibility between principles of the REBRAUPS and the National Policy for Integrative and Complementary Practices (PNPIC) indicate that initiatives like this one is a good practice to mobilize in the Brazilian health promotion context.";Massage therapy as an integrative practice for health promotion in the academic context;;The inclusion of integrative practices in the academic context is encouraged, considering the convergence with health policies and health promotion practices observed in the UPS guidelines.;"Massage; Complementary Therapies; health promotion; "

In this context, the SIID ERA civilizational model operates as a horizon for rebuilding health — not merely as the absence of disease, but as a dynamic state of vitality, consciousness and human dignity.

Adopting an ecology of knowledge, the initiative integrates both biomedical approaches and ancestral/energetic wisdoms, enabling regenerative integrative care experiences. Health is approached as a broad process encompassing physical, emotional, mental, social, spiritual and planetary dimensions.

The practice articulates local primary care networks (Brazilian SUS), popular knowledge, vital-energy-based therapies (therapeutic touch, pranic healing), conscious nutrition, accessible biohacking and active listening methodologies, aimed at restoring trust in one’s own body and human relationships. Through the SIID ERA approach, each action is a civilizational act: rescuing autonomy, nurturing dignity, sowing care networks and expanding consciousness — not simply treating symptoms, but reprogramming realities. The initiative contributes to the SDGs related to health and wellbeing, gender equality, reduction of inequalities and resilient communities.";"2) What is SIID ERA

SIID ERA is an applied civilizational model and innovation institute (Scientific and Innovation Institute for Development – Eco Regions of Abundance). It acts simultaneously as a methodology and an organization.

Nature: Think tank + open-innovation lab focused on regenerative futures and deep-health.

Structure: Organized as a social innovation network connecting universities (e.g., PUC-Campinas, USP), governments, communities, private investors and ancestral knowledge holders.

Financing: Works through blended finance (public grants, philanthropic capital, ESG-innovation investments, community crowdfunding, cooperative revenues).

Methodology: Integrates health, ecology, education, spirituality and technology to produce micro-ecosystems of abundance, especially in vulnerable territories.

3) Context / Geographic & Socio-demographic Situation

Country: Brazil

City/Region: Western urban periphery of São Paulo

Territory characteristics: High population density, low HDI, poverty concentration, domestic violence reports, weak community networks, food insecurity and limited access to care. Predominance of women caregivers and Black/Brown populations historically excluded from mainstream health infrastructures.";"4) Background of the Experience

Implementation started: 2021 (postpandemic)

Human resources involved: ~20 people (1 coordinator SIID ERA, 4 integrative therapists, 2 nurses, 1 popular educator, 1 nutritionist, 1 psychologist, 10 community-based volunteers)

Number of people impacted: ~1,000 individuals

Integrative practices used: therapeutic touch, pranic healing, auriculotherapy, mindful nutrition, phytotherapy, group breathing, body-listening circles, biohacking with hydrogen water and solar energy.

Professionals involved: nurses, psychologists, traditional healers, educators, therapists, SUS community health agents.

Initial focus: not a single clinical case, but a broader community-based intervention.";"5) Note on Case vs. Experience Report

Although one patient was described to illustrate context, this is not a clinical case report, but rather an experience-based community report with collective results. The abstract should therefore focus on overall impacts, rather than on an individual case.";"Planetary Health; Integrative Medicine; Civilization"

This method is applicable to a wide range of conditions, including various organic dysfunctions, pain, insomnia, and psycho-emotional issues, and has demonstrated effectiveness in supporting the treatment of addictions (Nogier, 2014). This report aims to evaluate changes in the physical and emotional conditions of visitors at Health events, to identify the prevalent complaints among these individuals and promote the effectiveness of CA as a valuable therapeutic resource.;"This experience report refers to the Clinical Auriculotherapy Workshops  conducted at three events in 2024: the USP 60+ Booth during the Expo-Longevidade; the Healthy Aging Symposium at USP 60+; and the International Congress of Gerontology at EACH-USP. Participants were visitors to these events. The CA workshops featured an average of nine auriculotherapists working for nine hours daily over five days. Visitors voluntarily approached the CA workshop booth, where they were offered a CA session. Initially, they responded to the question: ""If you could change something about your health today, what would it be?"" If they mentioned pain, the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) was applied before and after therapy, ranging from 0 (no pain) to 10 (intense pain). The ears were examined and treated based on the complaints presented, utilizing electrostimulation and needle insertion in the external ear at the identified altered points. These treatments followed the recommendations of Resolutions 466/2012 and 510/2016 of the National Health Council.";"The sample included 644 participants, consisting of 581 women and 93 men, with an average age of 64 years. The most common prevalent complaint was musculoskeletal pain, reported by 430 participants. Additionally, there were complaints of anxiety/depressive symptoms (135), insomnia (50), and other complaints in smaller numbers. Among the 430 participants who reported pain, 426 experienced immediate improvement, with a predominant difference of five points in the VAS when comparing initial pain levels to final evaluations. Furthermore, 114 participants reported zero pain, indicating a complete absence of pain as a final effect of the therapy. Notably, some participants contacted us in person or by phone to share improvements in undesirable signs and symptoms in the physical and emotional aspects that were treated during the sessions.
CA has proven effective in reducing chronic musculoskeletal pain, emerging as an efficient therapeutic option for promoting health and recovery (Morais et al., 2020; Nassif, 2020). The reviewed articles demonstrated that auriculotherapy is an effective method for reducing chronic musculoskeletal pain and is well accepted by patients. This evidence is highly relevant for healthcare, considering that auriculotherapy represents an easy-to-apply therapeutic resource with relatively few side effects, supporting health promotion and recovery (Morais et al., 2020). A systematic literature review by Nassif (2020) found a positive effect on pain relief in 69% of the analyzed studies, with a 100% success rate when applied with laser. Regarding psycho-emotional effects, Correa et al. (2020), reported that auriculotherapy proved effective in most studies across various clinical situations involving stress, anxiety, and depression, including conditions such as multiple sclerosis, substance abuse, dementia, headache associated with traumatic brain injury, insomnia, and pain. In addition to its effectiveness, CA has shown to be minimally invasive, safe, low-cost, and requires little time for application. Notably, the use of CA in patients with depressive symptoms resulted in significant improvements, bringing benefits in health, social, and economic aspects, as found by Crespo (2018) in a study involving 206 patients treated with CA for anxiety-depressive syndrome. Participants also reported that auriculotherapy contributed to improved sleep quality, corroborating findings by Cordeiro, Kuba, and Turrini (2023), who studied sleep quality in 80 nursing professionals experiencing stress and observed that auriculotherapy significantly contributed to the improvement of insomnia.";The results demonstrated immediate pain relief in the majority of participants, along with improvements in various signs and symptoms that were affecting their overall well-being. These findings underscore the significance of integrating Clinica Auriculotherapy into both  public and the private healthcare settings, highlighting its potential as a valuable therapeutic option for enhancing patient care and promoting health.;"Auriculotherapy; Pain; Anxiety; Depressive symptoms; "

This treatment is grounded in the theory of somatotopic representation, which posits that the external ear reflects the body's regions as a whole. When this treatment is applied to specifically identified areas, the corresponding body part responds with a homeostatic reaction (Nihashi et al., 2001; Nogier, 2021), resulting from the modulation of the Central Nervous System (Rabischong and Terral, 2014).
Both the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Brazilian Ministry of Health recognize Auriculotherapy as an integrative practice due to its effectiveness in treating multiple disorders, including chronic pain, gastrointestinal issues, emotional disturbances, and enhancing athletic performance. Despite being recognized and utilized in the Brazilian's Unified Health System (SUS) and by some professional councils, training in this field still lacks comprehensive federal regulation to establish minimum standards and ensure quality and consistency in the training of auriculotherapists nationwide.
";"In response to the existing gap in undestanding the foundations of auriculotherapy and with the goal of enhancing the quality of auriculotherapist training, ensuring their professional recognition, and providing legal security for both practitioners and patients, the Escola Raphaël Nogier de Auriculoterapia Clínica (ERNAC) was established in Brazil in 2014 in partnership with the Groupe Lyonnais d’Études Médicales (GLEM). 
From 2014 to 2020, training was conducted through in-person courses, during which 88 auriculotherapists were trained. Since 2020, the complete course, comprising over 380 hours, has been offered in a Distance Learning (EAD) format. During this period, an exclusive course focused on musculoskeletal pain, known as ""DMSK"", was created, training 153 students. Beginning in 2023, a technical cooperation partnership was established with Focus University, transforming the course into a lato sensu postgraduate program recognized by the Brazilian's Ministry of Education (MEC), now offered in EAD format, with a total workload of 500 hours. 
All classes are conducted remotely with simultaneous recordings, facilitating students' access for content review and accommodating any absences. 
The curriculum encompasses a variety of subjects that cover both the theoretical and clinical aspects of Auriculotherapy, including opportunities for supervised in-person practice conducted by monitors trained by ERNAC, currently available in seven major cities across Brazil.
Additionally, the course includes close monitoring through synchronous mentoring conducted via videoconferencing platforms, both by the representative in Latin America and by Dr. Raphaël Nogier, WHO advisor on Auriculotherapy. Students also have access to the most comprehensive and up-to-date written materials on Auriculotherapy, consisting of brochures (BookWorks) delivered weakly, totaling 591 pages. The course is exclusively designed for health professionals seeking to enhance their skills and knowledge in this complementary integrative practice.
This report aims to share eleven years of teaching experience in Clinical Auriculotherapy in Brazil, following the principles of Dr. Paul Nogier and to raise awareness among health professionals about the importance of proper training to use this practice competently and respectfully with the individuals they assist.";"ERNAC, in the distance learning format, has trained 684 Auriculotherapists in Brazil, including 161 physiotherapists, 143 nurses, 76 pharmacists, 56 physicians, 26 dentists, 27 psychologists, 18 physical education professionals, seven occupational therapists, and two gerontologists, among many other health professionals, totaling 25 different specialties. Most of these professionals reside in the state of São Paulo, but there are auriculotherapists distributed throughout Brazil and abroad, a fact resulting from the ease of the course being offered almost entirely remotely, with the possibility of monthly in-person practical supervision. ERNAC also has international students residing in Portugal, Spain, Peru, El Salvador, Argentina, Paraguay, and Japan.
To date, 50 auriculotherapists trained by ERNAC have had the opportunity to travel to Lyon, France, to complete an advanced course at GLEM.
It is noteworthy that, despite the lack of a specific number of individuals claiming to be auriculotherapists in Brazil, some professional councils in the health field, such as the Federal Council of Physiotherapy and Occupational Therapy (COFFITO) and the Federal Nursing Council (COFEN), recognize Auriculotherapy as a practice that can be utilized by their professionals, provided that proper training is demonstrated. However, they are often unaware of the difference between Clinical Auriculotherapy (CA) and auricular acupuncture derived from Traditional Chinese Medicine.
The commitment of ERNAC to the competence of these auriculotherapists is immense, which is why there is a continuous effort in the education and learning of these professionals through the Community of Essential Professionals, a sector where only the 684 professionals trained at ERNAC are accepted for case discussions and the development of strategies for Auriculotherapy in various dysfunctions and/or pathologies.
Furthermore, in November 2025, 28 auriculotherapists will have the opportunity to enhance their professional competence in the birthplace of Auriculotherapy, at GLEM, where theoretical and practical improvement classes will be taught, especially on Vascular Sign and Nogier Frequencies, by the world reference in Auriculotherapy, Dr. Raphaël Nogier, with simultaneous translation provided by his representative in Portuguese and Spanish, Dr. Larissa Bachir.

";"The data presented highlight the critical importance of quality education in Clinical Auriculotherapy (CA) and the need for health professionals to be aware of the value of postgraduate studies that teach authentic Auriculotherapy. It is essential for the Ministry of Education (MEC), along with the Federal and State Councils of Education and the resolutions of health professional councils, to take responsibility for CA and establish clear criteria for the competent practice of these professionals. By doing so, we can ensure that practitioners are well-equipped to provide effective and respectful care, ultimately benefiting the individuals they serve.

He is the creator of Dynamic BioSinging, a unique therapeutic approach that integrates vocal expression, music therapy, and body awareness, inspired by both ancestral traditions and contemporary health practices.

His work is deeply rooted in rural and peri-urban communities of Brazil, particularly in regions where access to traditional health services is limited. In these settings, Raphael combines Singtherapy, Agroecological principles, and music as powerful tools for collective healing and community resilience. These environments provide fertile ground for reconnecting individuals with their natural rhythms, cultural roots, and inner vitality.

Raphael’s approach emphasizes not only personal well-being but also social and environmental regeneration. He facilitates workshops, healing retreats, and community-based projects that engage participants in self-discovery, land-based practices, and sound exploration.

Over the years, he has represented his work at several international integrative health conferences across Latin America and Europe, contributing to global dialogues on the role of art, ecology, and indigenous wisdom in healthcare. His vision continues to inspire a broader understanding of healing as a dynamic, creative, and grounded process.";"The Dynamic BioSinging approach addresses a range of interconnected challenges in health and well-being, particularly in underserved and rural communities:

- Emotional and psychological distress: Many individuals face anxiety, depression, trauma, and emotional blockages due to social isolation, economic hardship, and lack of access to mental health services. Dynamic BioSinging offers a non-verbal, embodied form of expression and healing through sound, movement, and vocal liberation.

- Disconnection from nature and community: Modern lifestyles often lead to a sense of alienation from the natural world and collective cultural identity. Through the integration of Agroecological practices and group vocal experiences, the method helps restore this vital connection.

- Limited access to integrative health practices: In many parts of Brazil and Latin America, especially in rural or marginalized areas, alternative health modalities remain inaccessible. This practice brings low-cost, community-based interventions directly to those who need them most.

- Suppression of personal expression: Cultural and social norms can discourage open emotional expression and creativity. Dynamic BioSinging empowers individuals to reclaim their voice—literally and metaphorically—fostering greater self-awareness and self-worth.

- Lack of interdisciplinary health models: The method proposes a new model that bridges voice therapy, music, somatic awareness, ecological health, and community resilience, offering a more complete and sustainable approach to well-being.";"The implementation of Dynamic BioSinging in various contexts across Brazil and other parts of Latin America has generated meaningful and observable outcomes, both on individual and collective levels:

- Emotional Release and Regulation: Participants frequently report a significant reduction in symptoms of anxiety, emotional tension, and internalized stress. The vocal practices provide a safe and expressive outlet for emotions, promoting inner balance.

- Improved Self-Confidence and Communication: The vocal and body-centered dynamics help individuals to strengthen their self-expression, leading to increased confidence, improved interpersonal communication, and greater public speaking abilities.

- Enhanced Community Bonding: Group practices foster cooperation, empathy, and collective awareness, helping rebuild trust and cohesion within fragmented or marginalized communities.

- Greater Connection with Nature: Integration with agroecological environments enhances participants' relationship with the land, food, and cycles of life. Many report a deepened sense of belonging and ecological consciousness.

- Cultural Revitalization: By valuing ancestral knowledge, traditional songs, and local cultural expressions, Dynamic BioSinging helps preserve and renew community identities and strengthens intergenerational dialogue.

- Low-cost, Replicable Model: The practice has shown potential as a scalable and accessible health intervention that can be adapted to various cultural, economic, and educational contexts.";"Recommendations and Challenges

While Dynamic BioSinging has shown positive outcomes in diverse contexts, its continued development and integration into broader health systems present both valuable insights and important challenges:

Recommendations

- Incorporate into public health and educational programs: Governments and institutions should consider integrating voice-based and nature-connected therapies into mental health, education, and community resilience strategies.

- Create interdisciplinary training opportunities: To ensure safe and effective application, it is recommended to develop training programs for facilitators that combine knowledge in music therapy, somatics, agroecology, and integrative health.

- Promote research and documentation: Further scientific studies and case documentation are encouraged to validate and disseminate the outcomes of Dynamic BioSinging, supporting its recognition as a legitimate integrative health practice.

- Support community-led adaptations: Empowering local communities to adapt and lead *Dynamic BioSinging* sessions ensures cultural relevance, sustainability, and long-term engagement.

Challenges

- Lack of institutional support: Despite its potential, integrative and artistic practices often face marginalization within formal healthcare systems.

- Limited funding and resources: Financial support for grassroots health initiatives remains a barrier, particularly in low-income or rural areas.

- Need for more facilitators: The expansion of the practice requires trained professionals who are both skilled and culturally sensitive, which calls for investment in education and mentorship.

- Balancing tradition and innovation: Respecting ancestral knowledge while adapting to contemporary needs is a continuous challenge that requires careful listening and ethical engagement.";"vocal expression; ancestral knowledge; art-based healing; nature connection"

It is characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain, with specific tender points, significantly impacting patients' quality of life. Common symptoms include sleep disturbances, intense pain, mood changes, and reduced mobility.

Although its etiology is considered idiopathic, studies suggest that oxidative stress is one of the most likely contributing factors, leading to alterations in the immune system, neuroprotection mechanisms, and pain perception pathways.

In this context, ozone therapy has emerged as an innovative and effective complementary treatment, acting in an integrated manner within the body. This therapy promotes oxygen regulation in the organism for several days, aiding in the healing of infectious processes, reduction of oxidative stress, and alleviation of pain. It also stimulates the immune, circulatory, and neuroendocrine systems, contributing significantly to improved quality of life for patients.

Studies show that individuals diagnosed with fibromyalgia seek medical services more frequently than the general population, especially for pain management. It is estimated that this condition accounts for approximately 15% of rheumatology consultations worldwide.

Thus, in light of the structural limitations of the Brazilian Unified Health System (SUS), it is increasingly necessary to invest in integrative and complementary practices that offer therapeutic efficacy, resolution of symptoms, and enhance the well-being and quality of life of patients.";"GENERAL OBJECTIVE:

To offer ozone therapy to women diagnosed with fibromyalgia in the municipality of Toritama.

SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES:

To implement ozone therapy as a pioneering practice in the State of Pernambuco;

To reduce pain levels and pain perception;

To improve the quality of life of women diagnosed with fibromyalgia.

METHODOLOGY:

The initiative was developed at the Medical Specialties Unit in the city of Toritama, Pernambuco, targeting women aged 20 to 65 years, with a sample size of N=112 patients. Participants were actively recruited by Community Health Agents, covering both rural and urban areas. The inclusion criterion was the presentation of a medical report confirming the fibromyalgia diagnosis, within the specified age range. The experience posed no risk to the involved population.

The intervention was carried out once a week, in a comfortable environment, where ozone therapy was applied both systemically and locally, according to each patient's individual needs and clinical profile. The treatments were reassessed after 10 sessions, in patients who completed the therapy without interruption. Additionally, all patients were monitored every 5 sessions by a rheumatologist from the Municipal Outpatient Clinic.

For evaluation purposes, several questionnaires were applied:

1. A socio-cultural questionnaire to identify the profile of each patient;
2. The FIQR (Revised Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire), aimed at assessing the various domains and overall impact of fibromyalgia;
3. The VAS – Visual Analogue Scale, used to measure the intensity of pain and to monitor the patient’s progress;
4. The SF-36 (Short Form Health Survey 36), a key tool used to evaluate quality of life and widely employed in public policy assessment studies.";"RESULTS

This practice is innovative, withToritama being the first city in Brazil to implement ozone therapy for the treatment of fibromyalgia in women, and it is easily replicable by municipalities of any population size. The patients underwent 10 sessions of ozone therapy, with systemic applications via rectal insufflation and/or minor autohemotherapy, in addition to localized applications according to the pain site.

Based on the sociocultural questionnaire, the typical patient profile was female, with an average age of 40, low household income, no personal income, and chronic use of prescription medication for more than one year.

Regarding the FIQR (Revised Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire)—which assesses the global impact of fibromyalgia on a patient's life—an initial median score of N=91 was recorded, indicating a very high level of impairment. After the therapy sessions, the reassessment showed a median score of N=39, reflecting a 64% improvement in the patients' quality of life.

For the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), the initial average pain score was 8.9, which decreased to 4.2 after treatment—a low level of pain for patients with this condition.

Finally, in the SF-36 (Short Form Health Survey 36), an average 71% improvement in overall quality of life was observed among all evaluated women.";"The incorporation of ozone therapy into the municipal health system has proven to be an innovative treatment with significant impact, making this municipality the first in the country to adopt this PICS (Integrative and Complementary Health Practices) modality for women with fibromyalgia. The initiative achieved strong adherence from the selected population and yielded exceptional results in improving quality of life and promoting integrated care for women living with this condition.

The experience can be applied across all levels of healthcare, whether in primary or specialized care, and is adaptable to small, medium, or large municipalities, given its low cost to the Municipal Health Fund and its requirement for only a structured care flow and qualified professionals.

Thus, with reduced pain levels, improved quality of life, and enhanced functionality in daily living activities, the initiative has restored joy and biopsychosocial well-being to its participants—fulfilling the primary goals of the project: to provide integrated care and create a significant and positive impact on the lives of women with fibromyalgia.";"Quality of Life; Ozone Therapy; Fibromyalgia; Public Health; Women"

Non-pharmacological interventions are increasingly being incorporated into healthcare practices, particularly those aimed at stress management. Forest bathing (Shinrin-yoku) is a therapeutic practice involving conscious and prolonged exposure to natural environments, promoting mental and cardiovascular health.
This case report describes the application of a forest bathing intervention within the Brazilian Unified Health System (SUS) in the municipality of São Bento do Sul, Santa Catarina, in 2024. This case report describes the application of a forest bathing intervention within the Brazilian Unified Health System (SUS) in the municipality of São Bento do Sul, Santa Catarina, in 2024. The objective was to assess changes in blood pressure (BP) levels among adult participants undergoing the practice. The experience report included18 participants aged between 20 and 72 years, with 16 women and 2 men, all registered in the SUS. The intervention took place at the Ecoparque do SAMAE, along an 800-meter trail through a dense rainforest. The activities comprised respiratory exercises, stretching, mindful walking, and focused listening to natural sounds. BP measurements were taken 10 minutes before and 5 minutes after the intervention using a calibrated aneroid sphygmomanometer.";The high prevalence of arterial hypertension as a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases highlights the urgent need for innovative approaches in healthcare. Chronic stress has been shown to exacerbate blood pressure levels, contributing significantly to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Despite this evidence, there remains a limited availability of non-pharmacological, nature-based interventions within public healthcare systems, particularly those that could complement traditional medical treatments. Furthermore, there is a lack of structured integration of forest bathing practices into public health promotion strategies, which represents a missed opportunity to leverage accessible, low-cost, and effective interventions to address chronic diseases such as hypertension.;"The forest bathing intervention demonstrated a hypotensive effect in most participants. On average, systolic blood pressure decreased by 15 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure decreased by 10.5 mmHg after intervention. Most participants exhibited reductions in both systolic and diastolic pressures, suggesting a beneficial cardiovascular response to the nature-based practice. A few individuals showed slight increases in blood pressure levels; however, all of them had baseline readings below the standard normal range (120/80 mmHg), indicating a potential adaptive bioregulatory response.";Based on the results of this experience report, it is recommended that forest bathing practices be integrated into public health strategies as complementary interventions for the promotion of cardiovascular health and stress management. Given the accessibility and low cost of nature-based interventions, forest bathing can be an effective adjunct to conventional care, particularly within primary healthcare settings. Further studies with larger sample sizes, experimental designs, and longitudinal follow-up are necessary to confirm the observed benefits and to better understand the physiological mechanisms underlying the cardiovascular effects of forest exposure. Special attention should be given to developing standardized protocols for forest bathing practices adapted to different population profiles, including individuals with normotension or hypotension. It is also recommended that healthcare providers receive specific training on the application of nature-based interventions, in order to promote their safe and effective incorporation into integrative and complementary health programs. Public policies should encourage the preservation of natural environments and the creation of accessible green spaces to support the expansion of such therapeutic practices.;"Forest Bathing; Blood Pressure; Nature-Based Interventions; Public Health"

This practice aligns with the principles of Planetary Health and the “One Health” concept advocated by the World Health Organization (WHO), which highlights the interdependence among human, environmental, and animal health. Grounded also in the concept of Biophilia — the innate human tendency to connect with nature — forest bathing integrates integral health by addressing physical, mental, and social dimensions while fostering environmental awareness.
Implemented in 2024 by the Municipal Center for Integrative Practices (CEMPICS) of São Bento do Sul, the forest bathing program was developed as a collective therapeutic activity, combining conscious breathing exercises, mindfulness practices, meditation, body movements, and environmental education. The initiative aimed to address contemporary challenges related to the pursuit of integral health and the impacts of climate change on individual and collective health. Fourteen weekly sessions were conducted at the Ecoparque do SAMAE, an urban area containing native forest, and were registered in the e-SUS system as collective health activities.
";"Lack of integrative and community-based mental health strategies in public health services – Particularly those that involve non-pharmacological, preventive, and nature-based approaches within the SUS.
Limited environmental awareness and disconnection from nature among urban populations – A factor contributing to stress, lifestyle-related illnesses, and environmental neglect.
Absence of structured therapeutic protocols using nature exposure in primary care – Despite growing evidence of the health benefits of such interventions.
Need for holistic approaches aligned with Planetary Health and One Health principles – Emphasizing the interdependence between human well-being, biodiversity preservation, and climate change mitigation.
Insufficient incorporation of biophilic practices in collective health promotion – Undermining the potential of sensory and emotional reconnection with the environment to foster healthier behaviors and ecosystems.
";"After the 14 sessions, the CEMPICS/Farmácia Viva team distributed an electronic questionnaire through the forest bathing WhatsApp group, containing questions on health promotion, perception of nature, and personal environmental impact. Results indicated that 100% of respondents found forest bathing important for their mental health; 84.6% reported perceiving a positive change in their well-being after participating; 92.3% stated that their perception of the environment and nature had changed; and 92.3% felt more impacted by environmental issues following the experience.
Additionally, participants were asked to describe the forest bathing experience in a single word. Reported terms included: ""connection”, ""relaxing"", ""essential"", ""therapeutic"", ""re-energizing"", ""magical"", ""wonderful"" and ""peace"". Throughout the sessions, the professional team observed progressive changes in participants' relationships with the natural environment. Over time, participants reported developing a sense of care and affection for the trail, feeling a sense of belonging.
These narratives reinforced the effects of forest bathing in stimulating biophilia and highlighted the importance of nature-based therapeutic practices for fostering this connection.
";"The experience of the 14 forest bathing sessions organized by CEMPICS/Farmácia Viva demonstrated the reach of the practice in promoting integral health and environmental awareness. Beyond individual benefits, forest bathing stood out as a strategy aligned with the ""One Health"" concept currently advocated by WHO. This integrated approach is relevant in times of climate crises, reinforcing the intrinsic link between planetary health and the health of people, plants, and animals.
The participants' chosen words to describe forest bathing reflect the reach of the practice and its ability to foster environmental awareness and self-care.
This intervention model represents an advancement in health promotion strategies within the SUS, uniting integral health and environmental consciousness.
Implementing nature-based interventions emerges as a feasible strategy to address contemporary challenges related to human and planetary health. Expanding this initiative to other municipalities and conducting long-term impact studies are recommended to consolidate nature-based practices as strategic tools for promoting individual and planetary health within the SUS framework

This pioneering service in Brazil, and in the world, was conceived by obstetrical nurse and doula Carla Bruço, and inaugurated on March 2020. It offers humanized prenatal activities based on pre- & perinatal psychology, as well as integrative health practices.   

Situated in a picturesque place, this Gestational Center is welcoming, joyous and harmonious, thus fostering well-being and health for women during their pregnancy as well as their postpartum period. When a pregnant woman arrives at the Gestational Center, she is seen by an obstetrical nurse who assesses her needs. Then, she has a consultation with a naturopath who counsels her as to which practices to choose.  

A wealth of integrative therapeutical practices offers to the mother-baby dyad a holistic integration that favors mutual empathy, understanding and respect, thus fostering physical and mental health. A multidisciplinary approach cultivates the physical and psychological integrity of mother and baby, as they delight under the guidance of experts in naturopathy, aromatherapy, Ayurveda, chromotherapy, phytotherapy, stone therapy, meditation, yoga and relaxation techniques, floral therapy, reflexology, Reike, Shantala, thalassotherapy, acupressure, acupuncture, relaxing massage, circle dancing, belly dancing, pilates, integrative community therapy, pelvic physiotherapy, art therapy (belly painting, cloth painting, crocheting, belly plaster), music therapy, choir singing and psycho-embryology. 
";High-risk gestational monitoring is a great challenge for the municipality, inserting therapeutic practices as an adjuvant treatment offers a welcoming and humanized treatment where pregnant women, postpartum women and babies are received every week.;"The Gestational Center also offers classes, workshops and meetings, to transmit essential information about the importance of pregnancy and the mind of the prenate, labor, birth, breastfeeding and newborn care. The aim is to inspire women to experience a harmonious pregnancy, birthing, postpartum and breastfeeding – transformative experiences – while valuing natural childbirth, their emotional universe, their social and spiritual impact on their family and community at large.  

Toward the end of the pregnancy there is a celebration in honor of the pregnant woman, to strengthen and empower her to live fully her experience of birthing a child and taking care of this newborn. Such celebration is called a Blessing Way and it includes a relaxing warm feet-bath that allows for the pregnant mother to welcome some of her most deep-seated emotions and embrace the mothering that awaits her with trust and hope.   

 About 18 couples per month get dedicated attention, so as to strengthen their family bond and promote responsible co-parenting. Fathers are welcome and have the opportunity of joining conversation groups, receive specific guidance and, when necessary, have individual or group therapy sessions. They gather information about fetal and child development, their parenting role, the importance of lending emotional support to their partner, and strategies to face the family’s challenges due to new dynamics. Such inclusive approach seeks to help building a solid base for conscious parenting and fosters family well-being.  
";"About 500 mothers – pregnant or in their postpartum period –, visit per month of mothers who are pregnant or in their postpartum period. The official team in charge of the Gestational Center is composed of 01 obstetrical nurse, 01 servant and 01 administrative person, all the others who work there are volunteers – registered at the municipality. They see to the women’s health and well-being. There are also 08 doulas who accompany the women when they are in labor at the “Hospital das Clínicas” of São Sebastião. The women are seen every week by the obstetrical nurse, enjoy a naturopathy consultation and afterward are sent to several activities, according to their needs. There is a WhatsApp group in which most appointments are scheduled.

The Gestational Center Harmony for Life represents an innovative model of prenatal and postpartum care that combines integrative healing practices and the tenets of pre- & perinatal psychology, thus promoting the women’s agency, as well as their sense of safety and plenitude. The aim is for them (and their families) to experience their pregnancy and postpartum feeling valued and respected. This kind of fulfilment has a positive epigenetic impact on the developing prenate and the newborn’s psychoneurophysiology and brings forth the profound beauty of this fecund cycle life.

The Recovery Model adopts a recovery-oriented approach for addiction and mental health to establish a recovery-oriented system of care with a coordinated network of personalized, community-based services for people seeking treatment for substance use disorders (SUD). This approach is intended to provide access to a continuum of services and supports, from prevention and intervention to treatment and recovery that is free, public, and holistic in practice. A holistic approach means the “development of new sustainable, practical and evidence informed innovations” focused on the multidimensional aspect to recovery that considers a person’s wellbeing, physically, mentally, spiritually, and culturally. Recovery from SUD is multifaceted, often complicated by underlying mental health issues making treatment challenging and complex. For some individuals living with SUD, a more holistic approach to treat the underlying mental health issues is required.

Reliance on current treatments has been met with varying or limited success [2], and relapse has been associated with underlying mental health problems. A holistic approach would benefit from integrating non-pharmacological options, collectively known as Traditional Complementary Integrative Medicine (TCIM) [3]. Evidence suggests some TCIM modalities such as yoga [4], meditation [2], and acupuncture [5-8] may be beneficial in the treatment of SUB and underlying mental health issues. In fact, growing evidence on acupuncture as a treatment option for SUB and studies of its mechanism of action [9] are relevant to translational medicine [10] to inform an integrated approach to SUB treatment and recovery.

Integration of diverse modalities and practices is limited in biomedicine within North America. To fully achieve a holistic approach, we needed to explore models of integration from other regions. Two current models of integrating diverse modalities are the Integrated Chinese-Western Medicine (ICWM) Pilot Programme in Hong Kong and the Integrated Framework from Singapore. The goal of this Experience Report is to present the development of a translation plan of the integrated models from Hong Kong and Singapore to the Canadian context, and to determine how best to translate the application of the integrated models in Hong Kong and Singapore (using chronic pain as a reference condition) to the integration of treatment for mental health issues in the context of SUD in Canada.
";What strategies can be learned from the Hong Kong and Singapore models of integration to inform the development of holistic care approach to treat individuals with mental health issues to recover from SUD in the Canadian context?;"A review of Hong Kong’s Integrated Chinese-Western Medicine (ICWM) Pilot Programme and Singapore’s integration framework provided key procedures and process to the translational plan to integrated acupuncture as a component of recovery treatment in Alberta Canada. Hong Kong’s ICWM, launched in 2014, integrates Traditional Chinese Medicine with Western care in public hospitals. Initially at 8 sites, it expanded to 26 hospitals and 53 service points by 2024 [11]. The programme supports multidisciplinary collaboration, with over 58,000 attendances and 3,560 patients by March 2023 [12]. ICWM complements standard care without disrupting treatment plans. It enhances multidisciplinary collaboration and has been associated with enhanced clinical insight and improved patient outcomes [11]. This model offers a scalable and sustainable framework for delivering holistic, patient-centred care to those in need.

Singapore is taking several steps to integrate Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) into its healthcare system, particularly through the Healthier SG initiative [13]. The Ministry of Health is developing collaborative models where TCM practitioners and Western doctors can partner. This collaboration aims to ensure patients receive both TCM and Western medical treatments, enhancing overall care quality [14]. They also introduced the TCM Information System (TCMIS) as part of its efforts to integrate TCM into the broader healthcare system and facilitates the digital integration of TCM practices with mainstream healthcare systems. This includes electronic health records that allow for seamless sharing of patient information between TCM practitioners and Western medical professionals.
";"To explore the adaptation of integrated care models for substance use disorder (SUD) treatment, it is critical to establish an effective, culturally relevant, and sustainable system that enables integration across sectors and disciplines. To extrapolate from the models of Hong Kong and Singapore into the Canadian context, the key considerations include strong clinical governance, collaborative practitioner training, equitable access to services, and the cultivation of public trust [15].

A review of international experiences on the integration strategies for conventional and TCIM healthcare practices identified 1) areas of agreement were leadership to integration, patient demand, and filling effectiveness gaps in conventional medicine, while ensuring quality and safety of TCIM services as a priority; 2) barriers included referral mechanisms due to diverse practice contexts, guidelines on responsibilities across professionals/disciplines, and interprofessional education to establish mutual trust and understanding [16]. The review also identified the strategies to integration must involve patient chart sharing, instant information exchange, and dedicated time for face-to-face interactions. According to Chung and colleagues (2021), learning from condition-specific referral protocols that are evidence based with detailed integrative treatment planning will inform interprofessional communication as a key to successful integration.
Several challenges must be considered from the Canadian context in adapting an integrated healthcare plan for Western conventional care with TCIM. First, establishing rapport and trust among distinct practices and philosophies of care, creating effective communication routes, determining a sustainable payment model for TCIM practitioners within the healthcare system, and streamline processes to avoid duplications and redundancies. Despite these challenges, given the WHO’s strategy of integrating TCIM [17], it is to the benefit of the Canadian healthcare system to work towards integration of modalities and offer a breadth of treatment options.

This article describes the impact on health and well-being of meditation experiences and meditative trails in a tourist resort in the state of Sao Paulo in 2024.;Case report of meditation and meditative hiking experiences in a resort town in the interior of Sao Paulo in 2024. Resort towns with natural beauty and riches in the state of Sao Paulo are important allies for nature-supported therapies. The search for and offers of tourism for relaxation, connection, rest, and care are becoming increasingly sought after by people in the state of Sao Paulo. Nature-based practices such as meditative trails and meditation in the woods were carried out in the Climatic Resort in the Municipality of Analandia in 5 meetings with 26 participants. Activities planned by an occupational therapist trained in Suseonjae Meditation, a South Korean method that focuses mainly on a breathing process and natural way of life that promotes the balance of the five movements of the body's meridians to ensure health and well-being.;Meditative walks in nature are practices offered on site during meditative meetings and, according to participants' final reports, they have fostered processes of self-knowledge, a sense of belonging, sharing of feelings and emotions, as well as improved environmental awareness. Authors such as Figueiredo and Printes (2025) highlight the positive impact of meditative walks in the cerrado (a Brazilian biome in the region) on socio-ecological resilience and social capital due to the collective process experienced by participants.Participants in meditative activities in Analandia demonstrate the impact on their process of relieving stress, anxiety, improving sleep, and changing perspectives centered on personal problems and experiences for better awareness of the whole and a flexible and expanded vision in the face of challenging life processes at the end of the activities.;The evidence of meditation on self-cognition, self-transformation processes and connections is in fact corroborated by science and increasingly shows possibilities for responsible insertion and with qualified professionals within tourism contexts as a way of changing patterns and societal awareness of forms of self-care and planetary care;"Meditation; Relaxation Therapy; Medical Tourism"

These practices have demonstrated growing evidence of efficacy and effectiveness, prompting recommendations for their inclusion in the education and training of health professionals. Incorporating PICS into undergraduate curricula, especially in Nursing and other health disciplines, supports a paradigm shift from a disease-centered model to a more holistic, person-centered approach to care, aligned with the principles of integrality and complexity in health.
The objective of this work is to report the experience of teaching Auriculotherapy in an undergraduate program at a public university.
";"This is an experience report on the implementation of Auriculotherapy and the training of facilitators linked to a community extension project. A descriptive narrative was chosen, based on theoretical and practical activities developed since the introduction of the first undergraduate discipline in 2021.
";"The project began in 2018, offering five short courses on the basics of Auriculotherapy to nursing and health-related students, with the participation of 179 students. Due to the high demand for Auriculotherapy treatments at the project’s clinic, undergraduate courses were created to train new Auriculotherapists. The courses are open to any undergraduate student at the university. Three courses are offered throughout the academic year: 1) EN928 - Auriculotherapy I - 45 hours, with 15 hours of Extension Practice. Offered every semester, starting in the second semester of 2021, with 4 offerings: in 2021 (online) with 61 enrolled students, 2022 with 47 students, 2023 with 31 students, and 2024 with 17 students; 2) EN929 - Auriculotherapy II - 45 hours, with 15 hours of Extension Practice. Offered every semester, starting in the first semester of 2022, with 3 offerings: in 2022 with 21 students, 2023 with 21 students, and 2024 with 14 students; 3) EX031 - Auriculotherapy Practice I - 45 hours of extension, with 1 offering in 2023, enrolling 10 students. Over the years, there has been increasing interest from students in other fields, beyond health-related courses. Offering the courses in the evening has enabled nursing students—whose full-time curriculum prevents them from attending at other times—to participate. As for students from other programs, interest has come through prior contact with PICS or from students who had previously taken the course. To facilitate access to the practices, students work alongside scholarship holders at the Auriculotherapy Clinic maintained by the School of Nursing, providing treatments to the internal and external community. An average of 40 treatments are carried out weekly.
";"The teaching of Auriculotherapy provides health students with a different approach to care, broadening their perspectives on well-being and treatment practices. For students from other fields, regardless of their background, training in Auriculotherapy enables access to a care model that integrates body, mind, and emotions. This approach breaks away from the traditional biomedical model and promotes health from a new, more holistic paradigm centered on the individual.
Challenges in Integrating PICS into Undergraduate Health Education:
- Integration into Traditional Curricula: One of the main challenges is integrating PICS into traditional health education programs, which often follow a biomedical model. This requires overcoming institutional resistance and adapting the curriculum to incorporate more holistic and integrative practices.
- Lack of Familiarity with PICS: Many students may not be familiar with PICS. This poses an educational challenge, as students first need to experience these practices in order to become interested and motivated to pursue further training in the area.
- Perception and Acceptance of Holistic Practices: There may be skepticism or resistance toward PICS. Auriculotherapy has shown potential to break down these barriers. However, overcoming such skepticism among health students and professionals remains a significant challenge.

Universidad Nacional de Trujillo - Peru;;Sim;Sim;Não;Sim;-;;;;-;;Restructuring the approach to health and education paradigms;Throughout the history of medicine, the concepts of health and well-being have undergone profound transformations. From magical-religious rituals, the use of rudimentary tools and reliance on the benefits of nature, to all the scientific and biomedical advances centered on the scientific method, to the segmentation by medical specialty, following the Flexner report in 1910, according to the organs and systems primarily related to the patient's condition. The consolidation of these segmented health systems worldwide today also directs education and research, focusing primarily on diagnoses, pharmacological treatments, and hospital-level recovery, rather than on the patient themselves, their multiple interrelated dimensions, and, above all, without the desired preventive-promotional approach, which considers the restoration of functional balance or holistic well-being.;"This report addresses issues related to the approach to health, requiring a restructuring that complements all the progress made to date. However, it considers a more integrative and functional vision, aimed at restoring the healthy habits necessary to preserve health and even reverse disease. It also seeks to delve deeper, at an academic and scientific level, into the therapeutic potential of nature and its biodiversity, as well as into all ancestral therapies worldwide.
For this paradigm shift in health sciences education, more integrative approaches are needed that link all dimensions of the human being, with greater proximity to social reality and a neuroscientific approach that allows for the development of new teaching strategies.
Furthermore, these aspects are promoted and complemented by new approaches in scientific research, reoriented toward natural medicine and complementary and integrative therapies, allowing us to understand and demonstrate the human being as a complex and interrelated being in search of balance or homeostasis.";The study doesn´t present results;"The authors' recommendations focus primarily on restructuring the approach to health, considering various actions and challenges in the process:
1. Expand academic training through undergraduate and graduate training, courses, and education in topics such as herbal medicine, ancestral therapies based on worldview, functional medicine and nutrition, and body-mind-spirit therapies.
2. Create a healthcare service at all levels of healthcare, in addition to a medical specialty in integrative medicine, based on a holistic view of health and integrating natural and complementary therapies.
3. Increased interest, through financial and non-financial incentives, in research into natural, complementary, and integrative therapies to promote the development of scientific evidence and motivate students. The implementation of these actions faces multiple challenges, centered primarily on a lack of interest in understanding this integration of medical specialties with the true dimensions of the human being, in addition to the financial interests, often personal, of officials or government agencies that prefer to continue with a system that seeks to make us sick through food, and then keep us chronically on medication, when the solution, through this restructuring, could lead us to true healing or holistic well-being.";"Medical education; Holistic Health; Traditional Complementary and Integrative Medicine; clinical research"

This effort embeds a Whole Health framework not only across academic and clinical programs but also into the fabric of the university’s culture—redefining how health professions education is conceived, delivered, and experienced.

Objectives
The initiative aims to: 1) Integrate Whole Health principles into academic and clinical training as well as institutional culture; 2) Prepare graduates to deliver whole-person, value-based care; 3) Align university systems with the quadruple aim and global health priorities.

Motivation
U.S. healthcare systems face escalating costs, worsening outcomes, and a provider burnout crisis. Education models have struggled to evolve in step with the need for integrative, prevention-focused care. SCU addresses this gap by adapting the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs’ (VA) evidence-based Whole Health model—shown to improve satisfaction, reduce opioid use, and enhance workforce well-being—to a university-wide setting.

Methodology & Participants
This submission qualitatively describes the methods of an institutional initiative currently in progress. SCU is implementing a three-year, staged plan involving: 1) Whole Health training for students, faculty, and staff; 2) Integration of Whole Health into curricula, clinical workflows, and campus systems; 3) Mixed-methods evaluation of feasibility, acceptability, and early impact.

Participants include students, faculty, and staff across interprofessional academic programs (e.g., Chiropractic, Acupuncture, Ayurveda, PA, OT, Genetic Counseling, Whole Health Leadership), SCU Health clinical teams, and operational leaders across campus.";"In 2023, U.S. healthcare spending reached $4.8 trillion, yet outcomes remain poor relative to peer nations. Chronic disease, inequities, and provider burnout persist. Traditional health professions education has largely remained reactive and fragmented, failing to prepare practitioners to address these systemic challenges.

SCU’s initiative responds by embedding Whole Health principles into all levels of training and care. Drawing from the VA model—shown to improve patient engagement, reduce opioid use, and enhance workforce satisfaction—SCU aims to shift academic culture and build a workforce equipped for whole-person care.

The initiative also responds to priorities set by the World Health Organization and the NIH, including person-centered, integrated, and preventive care. It supports development of a resilient, community-engaged workforce trained to deliver care aligned with patient values, purpose, and well-being.

SCU has encountered several challenges during early implementation: 1) Cultural resistance and change fatigue: Some faculty and staff are skeptical or concerned about added workload; 2) Competing priorities: Institutional bandwidth is limited, and clear incentives are needed for sustained engagement; 3) Resource limitations: Ongoing investment in training and coordination is needed, especially without external funding; 4) Operational complexity: Embedding Whole Health into curricula, policies, and clinical workflows requires cross-departmental collaboration; 5) Evaluation constraints: Building a meaningful evidence base will take time, and early skepticism can arise without immediate results.

Despite these challenges, SCU’s approach provides a framework for addressing foundational barriers in health professions education.";"SCU’s Whole Health University initiative is in early implementation. Completed activities include: 1) Leadership alignment across academic, clinical, and administrative areas; 2) Campus-wide awareness-building through forums and introductory presentations; 3) 
Development and launch of a three-year Whole Health training program; 4) Design of a research framework to evaluate feasibility, outcomes, and institutional impact.

Evaluation aims include: 1) Assessing feasibility and acceptability of Whole Health training; 2) Tracking changes in satisfaction, engagement, and performance among faculty, staff, and students; 3) Monitoring policy and procedural changes at the institutional level; 4) Measuring self-efficacy, well-being, and quality of life indicators; 5) Exploring stakeholder perceptions of Whole Health and its future applicability.

Mixed-methods data collection includes institutional surveys (e.g., HERI, Great Colleges to Work For), retention/absenteeism metrics, and qualitative interviews and focus groups. Baseline measurement and initial training activities are launching in the current academic year.";"SCU’s early experience offers guidance for institutions seeking to implement similar transformations. Key recommendations include:
1) Secure leadership support early, and engage faculty and staff through transparent communication and staged participation; 2) 
Establish a structured evaluation framework at the outset to track adaptation, progress, and impact; 3) Anticipate cultural and operational resistance, and proactively address concerns through workload planning, incentives, and cross-functional collaboration; 4) 
Embed Whole Health into institutional systems—onboarding, professional development, and student support—to promote sustainability.

While measurable outcomes are still in development, SCU’s structured, staged approach has fostered early alignment and engagement. This model may offer a roadmap for other institutions seeking to cultivate healthier campus cultures and prepare graduates for the future of healthcare.";"Whole Health; health professions education; Integrative Health; patient-centered care; healthcare workforce resilience"

Data such as sex, age, weight and length of hospitalization were collected from electronic medical records. Yoga classes were held daily, lasting 40 minutes, based on the principles of Hatha Yoga. The structure of the sessions prioritized breathing techniques (pranayama), adapted postures (asana), meditation (dhyana) and mindfulness, respecting the physical and emotional limitations of the participants. Patients with reduced mobility participated in the classes, with adapted movements, using their wheelchairs. The environment was prepared with tatami mats, mattresses and ergonomic chairs with high load capacity, as well as natural lighting, promoting relaxation and concentration.;Conducting yoga classes for hospitalized obese patients required constant adaptation of practices to meet motor limitations. The postures were adjusted individually, prioritizing cardiorespiratory safety and physical comfort. From a psychosocial point of view, initial resistance to the practice was observed on the part of some patients, who often had a history of anxiety, low self-esteem, depression and difficulty in dealing with introspection. The professional approach needed to be sensitive, gradual and focused on welcoming, using accessible language and building a therapeutic bond.;The study included 350 patients with grade I, II and III obesity, aged between 12 and 90 years, of both sexes, with no clinical contraindications for the practice. The majority were female (68%), with an average age of 46±17 years, average BMI of 43±6 kg/m², average weight of 117±22 kg and average length of hospital stay of 118±47 days. The experience indicated that the inclusion of yoga in the hospital environment was feasible and enabled, throughout the sessions, greater adherence by patients to the practice, with spontaneous reports of well-being, reduced anxiety and improved body perception. Regular experience of breathing techniques, accessible postures and mindfulness contributed to strengthening the bond with one's own body and to developing self-care attitudes, essential aspects in processes of lifestyle change. The progressive engagement of patients signals the potential of yoga as a complementary resource in promoting self-regulation and body awareness in individuals with obesity in hospitalization.;Implementing yoga classes in hospital settings requires the instructor's technical knowledge and experience to adapt the techniques to the patients' conditions. Experience has shown that introducing hospital yoga can be a complementary strategy in the fight against obesity, as it helps to strengthen the body-mind bond and acts as a therapeutic tool to combat anxiety, food urges and low self-esteem, which are aspects frequently present in this patient profile and relevant to treatment adherence.;"yoga; obesity; hospitalization"

It´s objective is to describe the learning and critical thinking developed by a medical resident from the city of Rio de Janeiro during and after the internship in João Pessoa. The research was made prioriting articles published between 2020 and 2024, collected from the BVS, Pubmed, and Oasis Br platforms. In addition, it was included papers from Brazilian authors who are references in the context of the topic addressed: Madel Luz, Charles Tesser, Marilene Cabral do Nascimento, and Gustavo Tenório Cunha.

The National Policy on Integrative and Complementary Practices (PNPIC) was established through Ordinance No. 971/2006 in response to the increasing availability of medical therapies derived from Traditional, Alternative, and Complementary Medicine in Brazil’s public health services. Currently, these practices are most commonly found in Primary Health Care. In João Pessoa, capital of Paraíba state, implementation began in 2007, and in January 2008, Municipal Law No. 1655 officially integrated PICs into the municipal health system.

In this context, PICs are offered in Basic Health Units, Ambulatory Centers, and two high-complexity institutions, wich Traditional Chinese Medicine is notably used for pain management. According to documents provided by the PICs management group of the João Pessoa´s Health Department, various practices are implemented in Secondary Care. The most frequently recorded in the first quarter of 2024 were auriculotherapy, acupuncture, flower therapy, and meditation. During this period, a total of 8,819 procedures were recorded across four outpatient centers.";"The rotation included placements in secondary and primary health care units, two PICs centers, one outpatient clinic, and one Primary Health Unit, where professionals such as physiotherapists, acupuncturists, massage therapists, and other health professionals provide care. It was a four-week elective rotation in PICs services in the capital of Paraíba. The resident observed practices from Traditional Chinese Medicine, such as acupuncture and auriculotherapy, as well as myofascial pain management techniques including massage therapy, cupping therapy, and dry needling. The units also offered groups in Family Constellation Therapy; Men’s and Women’s Groups; Self-Esteem Management; and Yoga.

As in other Brazilian cities, João Pessoa faces both strengths and challenges regarding the services that provide integrative care in the city of João Pessoa. Primary Health Care (PHC) is the gateway for users of Brazil’s Unified Health System (SUS). PHC is tasked with providing comprehensive care with a family and community focus, which aligns with the goals of integrative and complementary practices. However, biomedical care tends to be prioritized, often due to a lack of knowledge among PHC professionals and mistrust among users. In this case, greater encouragement from managers and institutional support would be necessary so that culture and technology standards are decoupled and new PICS are accepted.

The lack of knowledge among health professionals reflects the limited promotion and inclusion of these therapies in university curriculum. Studies show that many medical and health training programs fail to incorporate PICs education, contrary to the goals of the PNPIC. Among already graduated professionals, especially those in primary care, some seek PICs training independently, often funding it themselves. This highlights a lack of investment and institutional support from health managers.

Another issue is that secondary care clinics tend to serve fewer patients. This may be due to territorial access, users living closer to the services are more likely to attend and also due to referral processes and waiting lists. Furthermore, due to the smaller number of places available, there is a socio-familiar distance, where it can be thought that, even in community approaches, practices tend not to be implemented in family approaches.";"These practices are associated with longitudinal care and stronger patient-provider relationships. In the PHC setting, there is an ideal environment for implementing complementary therapies. At the same time, PICs have been integrated into secondary and tertiary care services, especially when supported by PHC to ensure continuity and comprehensiveness of care.

In situations where PHC may not be providing adequate care, services can be better integrated, for instance, by incorporating PICs into routine health unit operations. One strategy is to allocate specific time slots or shifts for PHC professionals to incorporate PICs into their consultations.

In units where professionals introduce PICs to users, strategies are often used to ensure they are included in care plans. These typically take three forms: shifts dedicated solely to PICs; integration with other PHC activities; or both approaches combined. However, these activities often occur outside of the standard institutional schedule and lack formal support.

Studies justify these strategies by pointing to challenges such as insufficient physical space, limited resources, and rigid scheduling, which are the main factors that make it difficult to practice PICS in primary care.";"This elective rotation demonstrated that, when considering physical, economic, and social aspects, PICs allow a broader understanding of users needs. When we consider Family and Community Medicine,  the care provided includes beyond treating illness, unique communication skills and continuity of care for the person, their family and social environment. 

Understanding the PICs policy and services in João Pessoa as simple, cost-effective, and somewhat intimate forms of care made this a significant and enriching experience during medical residency training. 

It could be suggested that residents in this external internship understand PICS management in terms of financing and organization, so that it can be used as a tool in the process of improving projects for the healthcare system.

Within this context, the Yoga Therapy Center was established in 2020 through the initiative of Lilian Aboim, an integrative yoga teacher and yoga therapist. She invited a group of yoga therapists—her students trained in Integrative Yoga Therapy—to develop what became the ComTato Program. The name reflects the program’s emphasis on sensory awareness, bodily connection, balance through care and mindfulness, and the importance of human relationships. Currently, the center has nine volunteer yoga therapists residing in the states of Rio de Janeiro, Santa Catarina, Espírito Santo, and Goiás.
The first edition of the program was held in 2021 in an online, synchronous format—an approach that continues today—allowing participation from various regions of Brazil and other countries where IZC is active. Offered annually, the program is exclusively available to registered IZC patients, regardless of cancer type or stage of treatment. It provides practical tools and strategies to help manage symptoms, reduce side effects, and strengthen emotional well-being.
According to the International Association of Yoga Therapists (IAYT, 2025), “yoga therapy is the process of enabling individuals to progress toward improved health and well-being through the application of the teachings and practices of Yoga.” The methodology of Integrative Yoga Therapy is rooted in traditional yogic principles and is adapted to meet the specific health conditions of each individual or group. It is a gradual process of harmonizing body, breath, mind, and emotions, guiding participants back to their inner essence—characterized by fullness and wholeness—even in the face of life’s polarities.
The ComTato Program was developed in alignment with this methodology, designed specifically for groups of cancer patients. It respects individual limitations and requires no prior yoga experience. Its structure encourages the sharing of experiences among participants, a fundamental element of the program. For this reason, group size is limited to ten participants per cycle. Each edition includes eight weekly thematic sessions, lasting 1 hour and 45 minutes, led by two yoga therapists. The themes are progressively interconnected, encouraging participants to incorporate the values explored in class into their daily lives through simple “home pleasures.” Sessions are organized to address the dimensions of body, breath, mind, emotions, and spirit, promoting integrated self-awareness and self-care. 
The techniques used include gentle, mindful movements that stimulate circulation, support joint mobility, and relieve muscle tension, thereby reducing pain. Comfortable postures promote stretching and strength, improving posture and balance. Breathing exercises help expand lung capacity, counteract restrictive patterns, and reduce anxiety while enhancing vitality. Relaxation practices at the end of each session offer calm, inner peace, and connection to subtle aspects of the self. Affirmative phrases, hand gestures (mudras), and visualizations are used to support emotional balance and foster self-esteem and confidence.";"Cancer is a chronic non-communicable disease with major public health implications. Studies show that cancer patients often experience low self-esteem, fear, frustration, and difficulty coping with loss and change. The disease leads to neurological and physiological changes that can result in chronic stress, sleep disturbances, fatigue, poor concentration, and hopelessness. These emotional impacts, often underdiagnosed, highlight the need for supportive interventions that enhance emotional resilience and quality of life. Research indicates that stress, anxiety, and fatigue negatively affect treatment response and recovery (Sadja & Mills, 2013). The Scientific Evidence Map of Yoga Practice (CABSIN; BIREME/PAHO/WHO) (BVS, 2021) provides further support for yoga as an effective practice for chronic conditions, including cancer. Systematic reviews have shown that yoga interventions reduce fatigue—a common side effect of cancer—and promote improvements in both physical and mental energy (Sadja & Mills, 2013). A study conducted by USP and Hospital Albert Einstein demonstrated that yogic breathing techniques can foster brain changes associated with reduced anxiety and increased positive emotions (Novaes et al., 2020).";"From 2021 to 2024, the program has served four patient groups, totaling 31 participants—mostly women. Outcome analysis is based on pre- and post-program self-perception questionnaires. Preliminary results show that nearly 40% of participants reported improvements in how rested they felt upon waking and in their vitality at the end of the day. Around 30% indicated better breathing, reduced anxiety, greater emotional flexibility, and increased joy in daily life. Decreases in fatigue, improved sleep, and enhanced mental clarity were also observed. Participant feedback reinforces these results, often highlighting increased serenity and self-confidence. Testimonials include:
“With deep gratitude, as it was a moment of deepening and reflection on my relationship with myself and with everything that surrounds us.”
“The program was wonderful and allowed me to dedicate myself more to my body, mind, and breathing. It was exceptional!”
“Yoga therapy certainly made me blossom again. I thought I would never find contentment and balance again.”";The program faces expected challenges, including managing differences among participants and limitations inherent to the online synchronous format. A future goal is to expand in-person offerings in cities where IZC is present and where yoga therapists reside. By participating in this congress, the team aims to broaden the visibility of the Institute’s volunteer-based health initiatives, foster new partnerships and sponsorships, and welcome more participants to benefit from the program’s integrative care. Another key objective is to encourage students and researchers to engage in studies based on the data already generated by the program.;"Yoga Therapy; Oncology care; Integrative Oncology; ZENcancer Institute"

In Higher Education Institutions, social responsibility is expressed through the university’s triad mission: Teaching, Research, and Extension. Since 1996, the Center for Studies and Research in Homeopathy and Phytotherapy (NEPHF), in partnership with the Department of Biomedical Sciences at the Federal University of Paraíba, has carried out actions involving various integrative therapies. Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs), digital tools, and social media have been used to broaden access to this knowledge. This current initiative is an experience report from the extension workers engaged in the “Path of PICs” project, which began on August 1, 2024, and aims to increase access to activities and knowledge related to PICs developed within NEPHF/UFPB, through the dissemination of audiovisual content on digital platforms, such as Instagram. A working group was formed to recover, develop, and publish content and activities related to PICs on NEPHF's website and across social networks. Extension workers were trained both in the theoretical foundations of PICs and in the technical aspects of digital platforms and audiovisual production. Additionally, open-access lectures have been held online and are available on the YouTube channel Cinema e Cuidado. In-person experiential sessions with various PICs were also conducted, primarily involving extension students. The implementation team includes professors, technical staff, and students from health-related programs (dentistry, medicine, and biomedical sciences), with the estimated audience comprising students from Brazilian and international health education institutions, healthcare professionals, holistic therapists, and the general population interested in learning about the practical application of PICs in health promotion and well-being. A survey of NEPHF/UFPB documents and archives has been conducted to catalog PICs-related actions. As a result, historical content has been compiled and made available to the university community and the public.;This extension initiative emerged in response to several challenges. First, access to knowledge about Integrative and Complementary Health Practices (PICs) remains limited, both within academic settings and among the general population. There is also a gap between technical health training and the holistic, humanized approach required for comprehensive care. Many students enter their professional paths without exposure to alternative therapeutic perspectives that value the individual as a whole. Additionally, the limited use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) by health extension projects hinders broader dissemination of knowledge. The project also responds to the lack of institutional visibility and recognition of PICs, aiming to recover and highlight their historical contributions through NEPHF/UFPB. Finally, it seeks to strengthen the university’s social responsibility by bridging the divide between academic knowledge and community engagement, offering students tools for more empathetic and interdisciplinary professional development. Our question was in what ways does the involvement of extension students influence their professional development and the advancement of comprehensive health care through Integrative and Complementary Health Practices (PICS)?;The students’ testimonials are shared below: “Throughout this journey, I realized that beyond technical knowledge, it was possible to embrace the human being in their wholeness, acknowledging the multiple aspects of well-being. This experience became a turning point, opening a new horizon full of meaning and hope”. “Participating in ‘The Path of PICs’ enriched my academic journey, enhancing my awareness of the imbalances that affect human beings and the diverse therapeutic approaches available for self-care and care for others. Furthermore, the project played a key role in shaping my professional decisions regarding the care practices I intend to adopt in my future career”. “The experiences, lectures, and studies on PICs were fundamental not only in building the professional I will become. I especially highlight the study of the Saint Germain Flower System and Usui and Tibetan Reiki, two practices to which I developed a strong connection. I had the opportunity to be initiated into Reiki I. I feel deeply grateful for everything I experienced through this extension activity. It is more than new knowledge—it is a life-changing journey, a shift in worldview and personality. It is a path of evolution from which the traveler no longer wishes to return”.  “The ‘Path of PICs’ project was and continues to be a great discovery. More than replicating these practices in educational settings, it seeks to understand the meaning and foundational roots that make PICs so significant. My experience in the project was strongly marked by the historical role of NEPHF in disseminating PICs to both academic and non-academic audiences. Looking at its past, one can see how much the center has contributed to increasing public awareness about the importance of PICs, evoking a strong sense of institutional pride”.;Promote broader integration of PICs into the formal curriculum of health education programs. Encourage the continued training of students not only in technical health content but also in humanized, interdisciplinary care approaches. Expand the use of digital media and ICTs to enhance outreach and public education regarding integrative practices. Strengthen institutional recognition and support for PICs within academic environments. Continue recovering and preserving the historical memory of PICs initiatives within universities as a foundation for future innovations in care and education.;"Integrative Medicine; Complementary Therapies; Students; health promotion"

This condition is characterized by the development or persistence of symptoms after three months of initial infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, lasting at least two months, and without an alternative diagnostic explanation. Although symptoms such as fatigue, difficulty breathing, and cognitive problems are common, there are more than 200 persistent symptoms. Since these symptoms can vary widely among individuals, the treatment of LCO requires personalized and multifaceted approaches. Given the impact of LC on lifestyle and mental health, non-pharmacological strategies that are already known are crucial in managing some of the manifestations. In this context, Yoga, an ancient practice that originated in India around 5,000 years ago, has been gaining popularity worldwide for years as an integrative approach to physical and mental well-being. Although it encompasses several styles, the practice involves postures (asanas), breathing techniques (pranayama) and meditation (Dhy?na).
There are many research and clinical practice challenges in the post-COVID-19 condition, particularly related to effective treatments. Therefore, it is essential that health professionals obtain detailed information about the patient's experience with Yoga classes, during and after treatment, in order to improve the understanding and management of the post-COVID-19 condition.
";"General objective: To offer a weekly group Yoga practice that provides physical and mental care for post-COVID-19 conditions and to analyze patients' perceptions after the intervention. Specific objectives:• To analyze the perceptions of patients with post-COVID-19 conditions about the general benefits achieved with the practice of Yoga; • To analyze patients' perceptions about the benefits of practicing Yoga in managing post-COVID-19 conditions; • To identify the barriers that hinder patients' adherence to Yoga classes. 
The action returned at the UBS in Arroio Trinta - SC, refers to a collective Yoga practice that began in 2013, with reference to the practice and work on the Ministry of Health website. The data in this summary refer to the period from 03/23/2022 to 11/30/2022. 
Participants were recruited through active search. Individuals with a laboratory or clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 were included, without stratification regarding the severity of the disease, age ?18 years, after the infection phase. 
Hatha Yoga is a practice that seeks to balance body and mind through postures (asanas), breathing and meditation. This line of Yoga works not only the physical body, but also the mind, emotions and the spiritual aspect. Classes were held at the UBS on Wednesdays from 5:30 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. The equipment used included mats, mats, sound equipment, and a room with adequate space. Breathing techniques (pranayamas) were performed, followed by guided and oriented sequences of postures, ending with meditation on topics relevant to self-knowledge, interpersonal relationships, and connections with nature. The practice was adapted so that students could respect their physical and mental limitations. In addition, information about integrative health was shared during classes.
After the intervention, participants were interviewed by telephone or in person at the UBS regarding their perception of benefits and barriers through a semi-structured interview.




";"Twenty-five Yoga classes were offered from March 23, 2022 to November 30, 2022, totaling 178 sessions. Sixteen patients with an average age of 51 years participated in the classes, of which 14 (87.5%) were women.
In total, 40 benefits of practicing Yoga in managing the post-COVID-19 condition were described, grouped after analysis into 10 subgroups. The subgroup “improved breathing” was the most prevalent (n=11), followed by “improved mental and emotional health” (n=8), described by patients as “improved anxiety; emotional well-being; anxiety control; emotional improvement; mood; control of anxiety and post-COVID depression”.
Regarding patients’ perception of the general benefits achieved through the practice of Yoga, a total of 37 benefits were cited, grouped into 11 subgroups. The most frequent subgroups were increased flexibility (n=7) and improved mental and emotional health (n=7), described respectively by patients as “improved elasticity, stretching and flexibility” and “improved anxiety and depression; emotional relief; improved psychological state; more balanced emotional state; increased tranquility and calm; joy”.
Regarding the perception of barriers to the practice of Yoga, 8 patients reported barriers related to work and 8 reported that the schedule made participation difficult, followed by health problems (of the participant and family) (n=5) and travel problems (n=1). Only one patient did not report any barriers.
";"This action aimed to offer a weekly group Yoga practice and analyze patients' perceptions after the intervention.

This report presents the implementation of Integrative Community Therapy (ICT) circles at the Health Sciences Center of UFES – Maruípe campus (Vitória/ES), conducted by an interdisciplinary team from the iPICS research group. The initiative aims to offer ICT as a collective care practice to graduate students in Public Health, as well as Nursing and Medical students. The experience highlights the potential of this integrative practice in promoting mental health, especially when used complementarily to institutional services that provide psychosocial, pedagogical, and health support to students at this university campus.
This report presents the experience developed by an interdisciplinary team composed of a psychologist, a physician, and a nurse — all trained in Integrative Community Therapy (ICT) and members of the research group Investigation in Integrative and Complementary Practices in Health (iPICS), affiliated with the Graduate Program in Public Health (PPGSC) at the Health Sciences Center (CCS) of the Federal University of Espírito Santo (UFES). This team implemented ICT circles in available classrooms at the center.
The initiative emerged as part of the activities of the course Positive Mental Health, offered in the second semester of 2024 as part of the PPGSC. ICT was used as both a pedagogical and therapeutic tool for welcoming, integrating, and strengthening bonds among students. The course, offered for the first time in UFES’s graduate program, deepened the concept of positive mental health, addressing it holistically — as the presence of well-being, autonomy, and resilience, and not merely the absence of mental disorders (Jahoda, 1958).
Initially, ICT participation was limited to graduate students within the program. However, from 2025 onwards, the circles also began to welcome undergraduate Nursing and Medical students, thereby expanding their reach within the university community.
ICT was developed in 1987 by Brazilian psychiatrist and anthropologist Dr. Adalberto Barreto, during visits to the Pirambu community in Fortaleza, in collaboration with residents from the Social Medicine program at the Federal University of Ceará. Since 2017, ICT has been included in the National Policy on Integrative and Complementary Practices (PNPIC) by the Ministry of Health (ABRATECOM, 2019).
It is also worth noting that this initiative is part of a broader and multicenter project titled Promotion of Positive Mental Health in Health Students, which involves institutions from Brazil, Portugal, and Colombia.";"Entering higher education marks a period of intense transformation, often involving distance from family and friends, and the need to adapt to new academic and social demands. This context can contribute to the onset of psychological distress, affecting academic performance and personal development.
Studies indicate that university students have a higher prevalence of mental disorders compared to the general population, with estimates ranging from 15% to 25%, underscoring the urgent need for mental health care strategies in university settings (JUNIOR et al., 2022).
In this scenario, Integrative Community Therapy (ICT) emerges as a promising practice, capable of fostering a space for dialogue, attentive listening, exchange, and connection — structured by clear rules. From a presented problem, ICT facilitates the emergence of coping strategies for everyday challenges in an atmosphere of compassion and freedom, free from projections and manipulation.
ICT strengthens self-esteem, resilience, empowerment, and social bonds, enabling a sense of belonging to a solidarity network (Barreto et al., 2020).";;"The implementation of ICT in the university setting revealed significant dilemmas and challenges.
Among the dilemmas are tensions with the dominant biomedical model in health-related courses, the lack of institutional training for ICT facilitators, and the dependence on political and structural support for its sustainability. Without such support, the initiative risks remaining a one-off action, rather than becoming integrated into the university’s mental health policy.
Among the challenges is the need for UFES to implement ICT training programs for faculty, staff, and students, aiming to expand the availability of circles to students from other health-related courses.
Moreover, it is crucial to integrate this complementary practice into the conventional mental health services offered at the university, including Psychology, Psychiatry, and Nursing — recognizing that ICT is not intended to replace these services, but to act as a complementary care strategy.
Finally, it is recommended to expand scientific research evaluating the potential benefits of ICT in promoting mental health in university contexts.

The needs of patients in palliative care include treatments to alleviate physical, emotional, spiritual and social suffering. In this scenario, it is important to think of new approaches that contemplate the complexity of care with the integration of other therapeutic models.
Integrative and complementary practices present a dialogue with palliative care because they focus on the patient and not on the disease, address the physical, emotional, spiritual and environmental aspects involved in the illness; and place the patient and family at the center of the therapeutic relationship1.
We report the experience of an interdisciplinary pediatric palliative care outpatient clinic that treats patients with difficult-to-control symptoms secondary to multifactorial causes. Working in an interdisciplinary manner, a doctor and a physiotherapist jointly develop a care plan and, through a multimodal approach2, pharmacological and non-pharmacological strategies are used to control symptoms by combining medications, physiotherapy guidelines and Traditional Chinese Medicine techniques. Through interconsultations, patients are monitored by the psychology service.
The outpatient clinic, opened in March 2023, is located in a federal university pediatric hospital that treats children with complex chronic conditions and disabilities. The purpose is to follow up patients who have been hospitalized at the institution or who are referred by other outpatient clinics.";"The main problems addressed are chronic pain, including neuropathic, somatic, and visceral pain; nausea, constipation, insomnia, anxiety, and irritability.
In addition to pharmacological management and physiotherapy guidelines, patients receive treatment based on Traditional Chinese Medicine. The main techniques used are Tuina, auriculoacupuncture, and Shonishin (Japanese pediatric acupuncture).";;"Although we are in a hospital, a space very marked by Western medical rationality, we observed institutional support for the outpatient clinic. The use of integrative practices has been well received by families and patients, who recognize the benefits of combining other forms of treatment in addition to pharmacological treatment. The main challenges, in agreement with data in the literature3, are the team's recognition of the indications for follow-up in the outpatient clinic, lack of knowledge about the use of integrative practices in pediatrics, and coordination with other services in the institution that use integrative practices.

Menopausal Hormone Therapy (MHT) is an effective treatment for alleviating these symptoms, but it is not suitable for all women due to contraindications and potential side effects. As a result, many women seek safer, accessible alternatives, with traditional, complementary, and integrative medicine approaches gaining popularity. Among these, yoga stands out as an ancient practice that promotes relaxation, reduces stress, and enhances overall well-being.
In light of these benefits, the ""Yoga for Women in the Climacteric"" extension project was launched by the Federal University of Ouro Preto (UFOP) with the aim of providing yoga sessions to climacteric women in Ouro Preto and evaluating the effects of this practice on climacteric symptoms.
The project began in 2015 and continues to evolve at UFOP. Participants are recruited through active outreach, including referrals from doctors, nurses, community health agents, and members of the research team, as well as direct invitations from friends and family of current participants. Yoga classes are held twice a week for sixty minutes, incorporating physical postures (asanas) to improve strength and flexibility, breathing exercises (pranayamas) to reduce anxiety and enhance breathing patterns, and relaxation and meditation techniques to alleviate stress and promote better sleep.
To assess the effects of yoga, we use the Kupperman Index (KI), which evaluates eleven common climacteric symptoms: hot flashes, paresthesia, insomnia, nervousness, depression, dizziness, fatigue, joint/muscle pain, headache, palpitations, and tinnitus. Participants rate each symptom as absent, mild, moderate, or severe. The total score reflects the overall intensity of symptoms, with categories defined as mild (1–19), moderate (20–35), and severe (above 35), based on a maximum score of 51 points. A score of zero indicates the absence of climacteric symptoms. Additionally, participants complete annual evaluation forms assessing their overall experience as ‘very good,’ ‘good,’ ‘fair,’ or ‘poor.’";"Climacteric symptoms can severely impact women’s quality of life and are associated with an increased risk of developing chronic conditions such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, neuropsychiatric disorders, and osteoporosis. In addition, conventional treatments like Menopausal Hormone Therapy (MHT) are not suitable for everyone due to risks and contraindications. This creates a pressing need for safe, effective, and accessible non-pharmacological alternatives.
To address this need, the “Yoga for Women in the Climacteric” project was initiated in 2015 at UFOP to offer yoga as a complementary therapy for this specific population. The initiative tackles the challenge of providing integrative health options within public health settings, supported by partnerships with local health authorities who refer women to the program. Despite challenges such as limited instructor availability and adaptations during the COVID-19 pandemic, the project has successfully expanded access to yoga, aiming to improve symptom management and overall well-being in climacteric women.";"Outcomes of the project show a notable reduction in both the frequency and intensity of climacteric symptoms throughout the development of the initiative. After six months of yoga practice, the most pronounced improvements were seen in palpitations (12.3% decrease), fatigue (18.0% decrease), and nervousness (25.9% decrease). Other symptoms, such as hot flashes, headaches, insomnia, and paresthesia, also showed meaningful reductions, ranging from 3.4% to 10.1%. The severity of symptoms improved significantly, with the percentage of participants reporting moderate or severe symptoms dropping from 26.7% to just 3.3%. Additionally, the proportion of women with mild symptoms increased from 65.6% to 86.7%, while those with no symptoms rose from 6.7% to 8.9%. These results suggest a substantial enhancement in overall quality of life among participants.
The success of the project is also supported by a strong partnership with the local Health Department. Health professionals from public clinics frequently refer women to participate in the program. Due to the growing interest and the positive impact observed, efforts are currently underway to expand the number of classes and reach even more women in the community.";"The project has demonstrated that yoga can be a valuable tool in enhancing the quality of life for women during the climacteric phase. High participant adherence reflects the significant acceptance of integrative practices, especially when provided in a supportive environment with active listening. The project’s objectives were successfully achieved, leading to a noticeable positive impact on participants’ quality of life. These outcomes highlight the value of yoga as an effective complementary practice in women’s health during this phase. It is recommended that public policies actively support the implementation and expansion of such practices. Moving forward, expanding the project to include more groups and fostering stronger institutional partnerships will be crucial for extending its benefits to a larger population.

Introduction: Integrative and Complementary Health Practices (PICS) have been gaining ground in the Unified Health System (SUS) as strategies that promote comprehensive, person-centered care, valuing traditional knowledge and therapeutic approaches that increase the resoluteness of care. This article aims to outline the implementation profile of Integrative and Complementary Health Practices in the state of Paraná, identifying its main weaknesses and potentialities, in light of the principles of equity and resoluteness in care. The aim is also to discuss the challenges faced by managers and professionals in consolidating these practices within the scope of Primary Health Care. Descriptive study with a qualitative approach, based on documentary review and analysis of secondary data available in the official systems of the Ministry of Health and the State Department of Health of Paraná.Regulations, ordinances and management reports that address the implementation and provision of PICS in the state were considered. The analysis was guided by the critical reading of documents and thematic categorization, with an emphasis on aspects related to equity, resoluteness, weaknesses and potential in the process of implementing practices. Conclusion: Despite the growing movement to value integrative practices, especially in Primary Care. However, in the state of Paraná, weaknesses persist related to professional training, financing, and regional inequalities that compromise equity in access. The resoluteness of actions is strongly associated with the articulation of PICS with other care strategies and the institutional recognition of these practices. Among the potentialities, the growing interest of professionals and the population stands out, in addition to the possibility of inserting PICS as strategic tools for health promotion and humanization of care. Overcoming the challenges requires investment in effective public policies, continued training and integration of practices into the SUS care model.
";This article aims to outline the implementation of PICS in the state of Paraná, highlighting its main weaknesses and potentialities, based on the principles of equity and problem-solving capacity in care. It also seeks to discuss the challenges faced by managers and health professionals in consolidating these practices in the context of Primary Health Care. The research presents a descriptive character and qualitative approach, based on documentary review and analysis of secondary data extracted from the official systems of the Ministry of Health and the State Health Department of Paraná. Regulations, ordinances and management reports related to the implementation and provision of PICS in the state were examined. The analysis was conducted based on a critical reading of the documents, with thematic categorization, emphasizing the aspects of equity, resolution, limitations and potential in the process of implementing these practices.;Significant challenges persist, such as the lack of professional training, funding limitations and regional inequalities, which compromise the principle of equity. The effectiveness of these actions is directly linked to the articulation of PICS with other care strategies and their institutional recognition. Among the positive points, we highlight the increased interest of both the population and health professionals, in addition to the potential of these practices as tools for promoting health and humanizing care. Facing these challenges requires strengthening public policies, offering continuing education and integrating PICS into the SUS care model.;"To strengthen the implementation of Integrative and Complementary Health Practices (PICS) in the state of Paraná and promote their consolidation in the Unified Health System (SUS), it is necessary to adopt a series of strategic actions that contemplate both the identified challenges and the observed potential. Strengthen professional training and qualifications – Invest in continuing education programs aimed at primary care professionals, focusing on PICS, ensuring technical qualifications and raising awareness of the importance of these practices in person-centered care. Increase funding and resources for PICS – Ensure adequate allocation of financial resources to enable the structuring of services, acquisition of materials and hiring of specialized professionals, especially in regions with less coverage. Reduce regional inequalities – Encourage public policies that promote territorial equity in the provision of PICS, focusing on areas of greater social vulnerability, through the decentralization of actions and technical-operational support to municipal administrations.Integrate PICS with other care strategies – Promote coordination between integrative practices and other services and programs of the Health Care Network, strengthening comprehensive care and promoting a more effective and humanized model.

Strengthen the institutionalization of PICS – Ensure institutional recognition and support through clear regulations, inclusion of practices in health plans and systematic monitoring of implementation and results obtained.

Promote social participation and community engagement – ??Stimulate the involvement of the population and health councils in the development and monitoring of actions aimed at PICS, valuing popular knowledge and promoting co-responsibility in care.

Expand systematic research and evaluations – Invest in studies that assess the effectiveness, impact and acceptance of PICS in different contexts of the SUS, providing support for the continuous improvement of the policies and practices adopted.

These recommendations aim not only to overcome the obstacles currently faced, but also to enhance the benefits that PICS can offer, promoting more comprehensive, equitable care focused on the well-being of SUS users.";"Integrative Practices; Equity; Resolution; Challenges"

Grounded in a biopsychosocial view of disability, its mission is to include and care without barriers. The institute is located in Osasco (São Paulo, Brazil), a region characterized by high population density, social inequalities, and low family income.
The project “Creative Dialogues and Self-Care Practices” was initiated by an atypical mother, founder of ISV, who recognized the importance of including herself within the care network. Motivated by the desire to share knowledge about the biopsychosocial view of disability with other mothers and caregivers, the proposal emerged.
Arising from the need to “care for the caregiver,” Integrative Community Therapy (ICT) became the foundation of the project's central objective. This objective was structured by a pedagogical coordinator and certified trainer in ICT, which ensured that the approach was more inclusive and aligned with the biopsychosocial model of disability.
ISV structures its program focused on family-centered practices. The project reaffirmed the fundamental role of family members and caregivers in the therapeutic development of children with disabilities, providing safe spaces for qualified listening and for the re-signification of pain and suffering.
Through ICT circles, the project promoted emotional support, restored self-esteem, and stronger support networks. Over a period of 18 months, more than 600 ICT circles were held, totaling 7,241 individual attendances. Throughout the implementation, evaluation questionnaires, surveys, attendance lists, and other instruments were applied, enabling continuous monitoring of outcome indicators.
";"From the listening processes conducted during the ICT circles, it was possible to identify the socio-emotional profile of the participants – predominantly mothers – as marked by caregiver invisibility, social isolation, emotional overload, paternal abandonment, lack of support, ableism and social judgment, and the erasure of the personal identity of caregiving mothers.
This mapping corroborates existing studies on the reality of people with disabilities in Brazil, highlighting the central role of caregiving mothers in the inclusion process. The Brazilian Law for the Inclusion of Persons with Disabilities (Law No. 13,146/2015) recognizes people with disabilities as subjects of rights and assigns to the State, society, and the family the responsibility for ensuring these rights (Art. 8). Article 28 of the same law emphasizes the need for public policies that provide support to caregivers.
The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, ratified by Brazil, reinforces this commitment (Art. 23). Studies such as Sólcia (2004) and data from IPEA (2017) indicate that approximately 85% of caregivers are women – mostly mothers – deeply involved in caregiving and rights advocacy. However, this role is marked by emotional overload, with high rates of depression, anxiety, social isolation (USP, 2021; ABRAz, 2019), and stress levels comparable to those experienced by soldiers in combat (Diament, 2009). Although the Brazilian Occupational Classification (CBO 5162) formally recognizes the caregiver profession, available support resources remain scarce. International research (University of Miami, 2018; Journal of Family Issues, 2019) also reveals intense psychological distress and suicidal ideation among these mothers. The Caregiver’s Practical Guide (2020) highlights contradictory feelings that often permeate their lived experience. In light of this reality, it is urgent to invest in public policies that acknowledge and support these women, ensuring dignified conditions for the exercise of their caregiving roles and positively impacting their families.";"The project had significant impacts: 80% of participants reported a reduction in feelings of loneliness and social isolation; 70% stated they received emotional support from other caregivers, discovered new emotional resources to cope with and care for their children's disabilities, and began to focus on their own potential. Additionally, 60% reported adopting self-care habits, improving communication skills, building support networks, learning to listen, to celebrate, to name their feelings, and to share knowledge and experiences within the disability rights agenda, alongside peers facing similar stories and challenges.
The ICT circles proved to be fundamental in creating a sense of belonging, connecting participants with shared experiences and fostering empathy and solidarity networks. These bonds strengthened emotional resilience and contributed to reducing stress, suicidal thoughts, depression, anxiety, and feelings of isolation. Participants reported improvements in self-esteem, self-confidence, autonomy, and emotional self-regulation, with positive impacts on family and social relationships. Peer recognition helped restore a sense of identity, validating emotions and supporting a more assertive response to prejudice, reaffirming ICT as an effective socio-emotional technology. The acknowledgment and celebration of small achievements encouraged a more hopeful vision of the future, encouraging self-care and facilitating adaptation to daily challenges.
The experience culminated in the creation of the world’s first Polo de Cuidado (Care Hub) specialized in the people with disabilities agenda, officially recognized by ABRATECOM. It also inspired the development of a municipal public policy (Call for Proposals No. 56/2024 by SEPCD-Osasco).";"Our main challenges were: (I) Ensuring ongoing training for facilitation teams, focusing on specialized listening and addressing ableism, considering participant profiles. (II) Deconstructing comparative patterns of suffering among caregivers, which weaken socio-emotional support networks. (III) Training the ability to read environments and people, with emphasis on nonverbal communication and emotional regulation. (IV) Addressing the difficulty of accessing one’s own feelings, often suppressed due to the erasure of personal identity within the exclusive role of caregiver. (V) Overcoming resistance to sharing emotional struggles, marked by previous experiences of emotional invalidation and frustrations. (VI) Developing critical awareness to communicative coherence through constant reading of behavioral signals during their children’s crises. (VII) Suicidal thoughts, sometimes accompanied by attempts, are a recurring reality in the lives of many atypical mothers.
As recommendations, we highlight the potential of ICT as an integrative approach that mediates socio-emotional changes, capable of redefining the experience of care and giving visibility to sufferings historically silenced. In this context, socio-emotional education is a strategic response to adversity, contributing to mitigating the impacts faced by families of people with disabilities. Initiatives such as this contribute to the construction of truly inclusive Planetary Health, One Health, and Well-Being Societies – which recognize, embrace, and value human diversity.";"Integrative Community Therapy; inclusion; caregivers; family nucleus; people with disabilities"

This work presents the experience report of extension workers in the project ""Induced Relaxation as a Health Strategy"" conducted from 2023 to 2024 at the Federal University of Paraíba (UFPB). The target audience consisted of 356 individuals from both the university community and the general public. For the extension workers, it was surprising to observe how such a simple practice could have such a profound impact—the simplicity of the sessions contrasted sharply with the depth of the effects observed.  


Complementary Therapies encompass complex medical systems and other therapeutic approaches that are now recognized within the Brazilian healthcare system and by the World Health Organization (WHO) as part of Traditional, Complementary, and Integrative Medicine. In Brazil, various Complementary Therapies approved by the National Policy on Integrative and Complementary Practices incorporate meditation and relaxation techniques. These approaches are based on the principle that ""any image firmly held in the mind is bound to manifest,"" suggesting that relaxation practices help individuals gain control over their mental imagery, leading to physical changes.";"According to the WHO’s World Mental Health Report (2022), mental health has become a pressing issue due to its consequences, including psychological distress, abuse, disabilities, stigma, and human rights violations. Recognizing the benefits of Induced Relaxation (Carneiro, Caribé, and Rego, 2020) and understanding university extension programs as key mediators between academia and societal needs, UFPB launched the ""Induced Relaxation as a Health Strategy"" project. This report documents the experiences of extension workers during 2023 and 2024. The project served as a self-care health strategy, while also providing training for students and fostering research on integrative therapies.";"Participants included faculty, students, administrative staff, service providers, and the general public, totaling 356 individuals. Engagement occurred through individual and group sessions across UFPB campuses, as well as personal practice outside the academic setting. Additional activities included: Regular posts on Instagram (@relaxamentoinduzidoufpb); distribution of informational pamphlets on campus; academic presentations at scientific events; a related undergraduate thesis developed by a scholarship recipient; the relaxation sessions guided participants through simplified breathing techniques and body awareness exercises, lasting approximately 20 minutes, followed by group sharing.  Key Experiences. Service Workers Group: Weekly sessions, though brief, were deeply meaningful; participants facing exhausting routines (often working through lunch breaks) found these moments to be a vital respite. Common remarks: ""This improves my day,"" ""I never miss a session,"" ""I wish this happened daily. Elderly Group (Paraíba Institute of Elderly, UFPB-affiliated): one-hour weekly sessions yielded significant feedback: ""It was excellent,"" ""I practice at home—it helps me sleep,"" ""I’ll come every week,"" ""I won’t miss it for anything,"" ""I felt completely at peace.” Reflections from Extension Workers: surprise at the profound impact of a simple practice; recognition of individual differences: Some participants embraced relaxation quickly, while others required more time, highlighting the uniqueness of each person’s response; professional growth: The experience reinforced the importance of empathetic listening, respect for individual journeys, and humanized healthcare—values that will shape their future careers.";This project underscored the transformative potential of relaxation practices in promoting mental and emotional well-being. It also demonstrated the role of university extension programs in bridging academic knowledge and community health needs.;"mental health; Relaxation Therapy; Self-Care; Complementary Therapies"

Motivated by this gap, three doctoral students set out to explore how CIM could be more integrated into conventional medical education and clinical decision-making.;Method: To address this, a collaboration was initiated with AMBOSS, German speaking leading digital platform for medical knowledge and exam preparation with approximately 440.000 users worldwide. The aim was to develop a learning module on CIM as part of the content for all medical exams, as 90% of German medical students use Amboss for exam preparation. Drawing on current scientific literature and clinical practice, the team wrote articles covering key CIM concepts and therapies for medical students and professionals.;Results: The resulting content offers a structured and accessible overview of CIM, centred on the main principels of nature-based therapies, as well as selected traditional medical systems. Each section was revised by relevant experts in each respective field and includes evidence-based therapeutic recommendations.;Conclusion: This project marks an important step toward closing the knowledge gap around complementary and integrative approaches in medical education. Establishing CIM in the learning environment of future physicians reduces prejudice and promotes a more open and informed attitude towards integrative care in clinical practice. As such this project paves the way for the integration of traditional and complementary medical approaches into the main body of conventional medical knowledge.;"medical knowledge; CIM; evidence based information"

The activity was held in Madureira, a neighborhood in Rio de Janeiro known for its strong cultural and emotional identity. The event took place at the Portela Samba School, a community landmark, which facilitated local engagement. The initiative was part of the extension project “Paths to Well-Being”, promoted by the School of Medicine at Faculdade Souza Marques. The goal was to offer integrative care practices focused on emotional health. The project consisted of one session per month over a six-month period, each lasting about one hour, with approximately 20-25 participants, one instructor, and one student mediator. Crystal therapy was chosen for one of these sessions to bridge popular and academic knowledge through a circle of conversation and exchange of experiences";"Issues Addressed:
A lack of community spaces dedicated to emotional care and therapeutic listening was observed in Madureira. Furthermore, medical education remains scarcely exposed to integrative practices. This activity aimed to address these gaps by fostering an environment for exchange between students and residents, where care was understood beyond technical approaches, highlighting the subjective dimensions of health.";"Results:
Among participants, 71.4% reported introspection, 64.3% felt more connected to themselves, and 50% experienced a sense of peace. Emotional relief (42.9%), a sense of energetic balance and being welcomed (28.6%), improved self-esteem (14.3%), and a feeling of protection (14.3%) were also reported. Only 7.1% did not perceive significant effects. For the students, the experience was transformative: they reported practical learning, active listening, and increased sensitivity toward care.";"Recommendations:
It is recommended that initiatives like this continue in areas with emotional and cultural vulnerability. Key challenges include the need for greater institutional recognition of integrative practices, training of qualified facilitators, and addressing prejudice toward alternative therapies in academic settings.";"Crystal Therapy; Integrative and Complementary Practices; Emotional Health; Community Care; Humanized Medicine; "

Furthermore, there is a certain conflict between traditional knowledge and biomedical knowledge, as many health professionals are still resistant to the use of medicinal plants, due to a lack of scientific evidence or fear of adverse effects, thus hindering the integration of knowledge. This university extension project addresses the promotion of safe and rational of medicinal plants practices through educational workshops that articulate traditional knowledge and scientific evidence. Focused on intoxication prevention and sustainable use, the initiative empowers communities to harness the benefits of medicinal plants while mitigating health risks.
We train participants in plant identification, safe preparation methods (teas, tinctures, ointments), dosage guidelines, contraindications, and interactions with conventional medications. Strengthen dialogue between traditional knowledge and scientific research to optimize therapeutic benefits, enhance flavors in culinary preparations (reducing salt/sugar use), promoting autonomy in self-healthcare management.";"Since 2018, interdisciplinary workshops have integrated hands-on activities, including:  
1. Identification of safe species;  
2. Practical sessions on preparation techniques;  
3. Interactive discussions addressing myths vs. evidence;  
4. Distribution of illustrated educational folders.  
Pre- and post-workshop questionnaires assess participants’ prior knowledge, usage patterns, and shifts in awareness regarding rational plant use.  
Workshops are held with groups of 12 to 20 participants, lasting 2 to 3 hours, fostering interaction among participants and personalized attention during practical activities.
These workshops are organized around a brief theoretical and scientific foundation, followed by sensory or experimental practice (cultivation, preparation of teas, spices, or homemade herbal remedies); discussion groups or experience sharing. The average cost per workshop is R$200 to R$300.
Evolving participant interests reflect changing health priorities: initial focus on gastrointestinal issues shifted to weight loss, anxiety, and sleep improvement, with recent emphasis on women’s health (e.g., perimenopause symptoms). Workshops adapt dynamically to these trends, featuring themes such as:  
- ""Let’s Have Tea!"": Highlighting adequate preparation of common herbs (e.g., passionflower, chamomile, hibiscus, green tea);  
- Phytogastronomy: Demonstrating culinary uses of herbs for healthier diets;  
- Self-Care with Medicinal Plants for Women’s Health: Emphasizing scientific names, indications, and safety.  
Interactive games engage younger audiences, while tastings and printed guides reinforce learning.  ";"Below are two examples of participants who changed unsafe practices after participating in the workshops:

Case A – A 65-year-old woman used a homemade mixture of street-picked boldo leaves with alcohol and camphor on her knees, unaware of the risks of picking plants from the street and their dubious identification.

After the ""Safe Herbal Medicine for Chronic Pain"" workshop, she changed her use of an ointment based on copaiba oil and arnica, developed collectively during the workshop, with instructions on concentration, method of use, and contraindications.

Case B – A 45-year-old man used to drink hibiscus tea daily for weight loss, but developed constipation.

Change after the workshops “safe identification and preparation of medicinal teas”, he started using standardized dosages with a measuring spoon, and learned that hibiscus is made by infusion and not by decoction and improved his constipation, which he attributed to incorrect use, and higher concentration of tannins from the decoction he was making incorrectly.";The challenges are multiple, including scarce financial resources, noncontinuous actions due to dependence on public notices or temporary partnerships. Despite occurring within an academic framework, the project reveals persistent misinformation even among university populations. Workshops facilitate multilayered knowledge exchange, validating traditional practices while integrating scientific rigor. The initiative underscores importance of community education as a potent tool for health promotion, blending cultural respect with evidence-based practices. Sustainability requires expanding medicinal gardens, training local multipliers, and fostering policy dialogue to scale impact.;"Medicinal plants; Health Education; traditional knowledge; community health  "

With the integration of a Multidisciplinary Team (Equipe Multiprofissional - eMulti) working with teams at a Family Health Unit in Ribeirão Preto, state of São Paulo, we identified the need to support health professionals with moments of care, silence, and introspection. The challenges included work-related stress, anxiety, insomnia, muscular and joint pains (especially in the feet, lower back, and cervical spine), and irritability. Due to these issues, professionals sought assistance from the eMulti for auriculotherapy at various times, often without proper organization for welcoming the requesting professional.
Therefore, based on this demand, a weekly group was created, led by two eMulti professionals. The group has an open approach, allowing participants to join or leave over time without affecting the ongoing support.
The focus of the group is to promote health care for professionals using two therapeutic approaches from Traditional, Complementary and Integrative Medicine (TCIM): group guided meditation and individual auriculotherapy performed before meditation. The goal is to strengthen individuals in a space of listening and support, fostering self-care. The group meets weekly for 30-minute sessions near lunchtime, aiming to minimize absence and encourage participation.";Work overload, physical and psychosomatic pains, mental health issues such as stress and anxiety.;After three months, we applied the Perception of Change Scale - Patient Version (PCS-P) to the eight participants who attended at least 90% of the sessions. The qualitative analysis showed that all reported improvements after starting participation, mentioning “emotional control”, “more calm”, and “greater concentration”. Of the 19 items on the PCS-P, 100% felt better than before in four areas: emotional stability, ability to handle difficult situations, sleep, and physical health. The item related to sexuality showed the highest number of participants with no change (62.5%), however, there were many reports of not having an active sex life at the moment. The others items saw at least 60% of participants perceiving improvements compared to their previous state.;The intervention demonstrated, both quantitatively and qualitatively, a positive outcome, and we suggest expanding this practice within the service to allow more professionals to participate. Additionally, it can be replicated in other services that have mediating professionals who are willing and trained to carry out the offered TCIM approaches. The care proposal can be adapted by incorporating other therapeutic approaches, depending on the professional training and expertise in TCIM of the responsible team members.;"Auriculotherapy; Meditation; Healthcare professionals; Self-Care; Primary Health Care"

This initiative, developed at the Roberto del Río Children's Hospital, showed how art and music transform the hospital experience, promote therapeutic adherence, and foster emotional well-being, especially in vulnerable contexts. Children and adolescents treated, with ages between 2 to 18 years, referred from nutrition, rheumatology, nephrology, gastroenterology and rehabilitation departments, with predominant diagnoses being chronic pain, anxiety disorders, eating disorders, autism spectrum disorder and depression. This report describes two outpatient cases treated with art therapy and two inpatient cases accompanied by music therapy. Informed consent was obtained for all cases, safeguarding the confidentiality and identity of the patients. The interventions were carried out by therapists trained at the University of Chile, who designed individualized therapeutic processes tailored to each patient's physical and emotional state. Progress was monitored through clinical interviews and qualitative reports submitted by caregivers and family members. The two outpatient cases received 60-minute art therapy sessions every two weeks, using pencils, watercolors, modeling clay, scraps, recycled objects, and symbolic elements. The first case, received 18 sessions, focused on facilitating emotional expression, promoting emotional regulation, and building a safe space for play, healing and support. The second case, received nine sessions, addressed aspects such as impulse control, symbolic grief processing and strengthening autonomy. Regarding the hospitalized cases, the music therapy sessions lasted 30 minutes weekly in a family setting, incorporating live instruments, voice, recordings, puppets, and multisensory resources. The first case, a patient in palliative care, nine sessions focused on accepting the diagnosis, supporting the farewell process, and strengthening the spiritual bond between mother, father and daughter. The second case, a patient undergoing cancer treatment, received thirteen sessions aimed at strengthening healthy inner cores, reducing anticipatory anxiety in the face of invasive procedures, and promoting emotional resilience in the patient and those around her. ;Among the main health issues today in our pediatric population are mental health disorders, nutrition disorders, chronic pain, autism spectrum disorder, children with special needs and palliative care, all of which produce emotional conditions that express through different diseases. Verbalizing these emotions is a challenge for adults but even more for children. Arts help them show and express what is happening inside themselves, making possible to offer different therapeutic strategies that help them cope with their emotions. ;In all four cases, children verbally and artistically expressed positive changes in their mental health and well-being. The first outpatient, stopped self-harm, urinary incontinence decreased, school motivation increased, and overall mood improvement was evident. The second case, aggressive behaviors decreased, family involvement increased, and a genuine desire to return to school emerged. The first hospitalized case, greater expressiveness, improved emotional regulation and moments of shared joy were observed during a terminal stage, achieving a deeply strengthened spiritual bond. The second case, anticipatory anxiety decreased and greater family involvement in the therapeutic process was evident. Treatment adherence was high, as measured by both attendance and positive feedback from families. No adverse events were reported. ;International literature has extensively documented the benefits of art therapies in pediatric hospital settings. Fancourt and Finn (2019) highlight their effectiveness in reducing physical and emotional symptoms, facilitating therapeutic bonding, and humanizing medical care. Our experience confirms these findings in a highly complex clinical and social setting, where art has served as a bridge between the biomedical approach and human dimensions of care. Art therapies offered children and adolescents a symbolic, corporeal and emotional space to express what was difficult for them to express in words. Among the program's limitations are the lack of quantitative systematization, the initial lack of knowledge from clinical teams, and the precarious structure, which was sustained through volunteer work without stable funding. Despite this, the results observed in patients and their families reveal the profound potential of these disciplines to be integrated into the Chilean public health system. Art therapies not only complement conventional medical treatment, but also transform it. They redefine the experience of hospitalization, opening avenues for expression, play, support, and meaning-making and strengthening the essential bonds that sustain the healing process. Arts were particularly important for expressing complex emotions and feelings that cannot be easily verbalized. In pediatric settings, their impact is integrative and deeply human.;"Key Words: Art therapy; Music Therapy; Emotional Regulation; children; hospital"

Unlike traditional clinical protocols — which are typically designed by specialists and focus on standardizing responses to specific diseases — the Antiprotocol seeks to decentralize decision-making, promoting a participatory model that values professional autonomy and local specificity.

This strategy emerged as part of a broader effort to humanize healthcare into the Public Health System (SUS). Its implementation involved the formation of multidisciplinary working groups, composed of professionals from different areas of knowledge within primary health care (PHC). , who collaborated to develop flexible frameworks for addressing common health issues such as smoking cessation, arterial hypertension and diabetes.

Through dialogue, the group reaches a consensus—after listening to and evaluating the diverse experiences in addressing a given health problem—on the most appropriate indicators to assess the outcomes of health interventions, as well as on which actions should be included as possible recommendations for primary care teams to address the problem. Each team will then select health interventions that best match their competencies and the profile of the population they serve.

Importantly, the Antiprotocol framework is supported by three core guiding principles:

1. Indicators and monitoring tools: Teams are encouraged to estimate the number of individuals affected by a given condition, map existing actions, and define outcome indicators to assess the impact of interventions.
2. Expanded clinical guidelines: These emphasize a broader concept of health, recognizing the importance of patient autonomy, affective dimensions, social determinants of health, and the role of knowledge and power in interpersonal and social relationships.
3. Therapeutic menu: Each Antiprotocol provides a diversified list of interventions tailored to the specific topic, enabling PHC teams to choose the most appropriate options based on local realities.";"Despite its potential, the current model of primary health care in many public health systems remains heavily influenced by rigid, disease-centered clinical protocols. These protocols are often developed by specialists and prioritize biological dimensions of illness, frequently overlooking psychosocial, cultural, and environmental factors that significantly influence health outcomes.

As a result, PHC professionals face several challenges:

- Limited autonomy: Clinical decisions are frequently dictated by top-down guidelines that do not account for the complexity of individual or community-specific contexts.
- Standardization of care: Protocols tend to homogenize treatment approaches, reducing the ability of health teams to respond creatively and effectively to diverse health needs.
- Marginalization of integrative practices: Many effective complementary and traditional health practices remain excluded from mainstream care due to institutional biases toward biomedicine.
- Disconnection from local realities: Centralized planning often fails to consider the unique sociocultural and epidemiological profiles of different communities, limiting the relevance and effectiveness of interventions.
These limitations hinder the capacity of PHC to fulfill its foundational role as the central point of access, continuity, and comprehensiveness in health systems. In this context, the Antiprotocol emerges as a strategic response to these systemic shortcomings, offering a new way to structure and manage care delivery.";"The implementation of the Antiprotocol has yielded several important outcomes: 
Firstly, the strategy has successfully promoted multiprofessional collaboration, bringing together professionals with diverse backgrounds to co-create solutions. 
Secondly, the inclusion of integrative and complementary practices has expanded the therapeutic repertoire available to PHC teams, aligning with the preventive and holistic orientation of primary care. For example, the Antiprotocol for smoking cessation incorporated auriculotherapy and acupuncture, while the one for hypertension included homeopathic and traditional Chinese medicine approaches. Notably, each Family Health Team selects its actions from a curated set of possible and contextually appropriate options listed in the Antiprotocol. These available options are not arbitrary—they are based on accumulated experiences within the municipal health network and shaped by consensus among participants working on each specific theme. 
Thirdly, by encouraging teams to define their own indicators and evaluate outcomes, the Antiprotocol has strengthened monitoring and accountability mechanisms, ensuring that flexibility does not come at the cost of quality or coherence. 
Finally, the strategy has contributed to a more democratic and pluralistic health management culture, empowering teams to make decisions based on local knowledge and community needs rather than external mandates.";"Based on the findings from the Antiprotocol experience in Campinas, several recommendations can be made for other municipalities or health systems seeking to promote organizational democratization and integrate complementary practices into primary care:

1. Encourage the formation of multidisciplinary working groups involving frontline health workers in the development of clinical and managerial strategies. This enhances ownership, creativity, and contextual relevance.

2. Encourage professionals involved in the Antiprotocol to share their experiences and knowledge with other primary care team members, either by welcoming colleagues for observation or by presenting practice-based reports in other PHC settings. This includes fostering spaces where professionals are open to receiving individuals interested in learning about these practices, thus promoting a dynamic exchange of knowledge within primary health care scenarios.

3. Develop adaptable frameworks rather than rigid protocols: adopt flexible ""menus"" of interventions, allowing teams to select the most appropriate actions based on local needs and resources.

4. Recognize the importance of social determinants, identify public policies that contribute to health inequities, and support community organization in advocating for more equitable public policies.  

5. Strengthen monitoring and evaluation mechanisms: Equip teams with tools to track progress and assess the impact of interventions, ensuring that innovation is grounded in accountable to the population served.

6. Promote policy alignment and institutional support: Ensure that regulatory and administrative structures support the integration of complementary practices and participatory management approaches within the health system.

7. Encourage research and dissemination: Support academic studies and knowledge-sharing initiatives to document best practices and facilitate replication in other settings.

In conclusion, the Antiprotocol represents a transformative approach to primary care management that prioritizes participation, pluralism, and responsiveness. It offers a valuable model for rethinking how health services are organized and delivered, especially in complex and diverse health systems where flexibility and inclusivity are essential for achieving equitable and sustainable outcomes.";"Primary Health Care (PHC); Integrative and complementary health practices; Healthcare democratization"

Supported by the Federal University of Ouro Preto (UFOP), the initiative offers free, open-access activities to local residents.
Tai Chi Chuan is a traditional Chinese martial art widely recognized for its combined physical and mental health benefits. By integrating intentional movement, breathing techniques, and mental focus, it promotes a holistic approach to disease prevention, physical rehabilitation, and emotional well-being.
The project aims to enhance physical, mental, and emotional health through regular Tai Chi Chuan practice, emphasizing the value of integrative and complementary health approaches. It also seeks to broaden community access to traditional knowledge, encourage self-care, foster intergenerational socialization, and support the creation of collective spaces for health promotion and disease prevention—particularly among adults and older individuals.
To support these goals, the project currently offers two weekly classes featuring movements such as Qi Gong Ba Duan Jin and the simplified Yang-style Tai Chi form. These sessions provide a consistent and inclusive environment for community engagement in health-related activities. Open to all individuals aged 18 and over, participation requires no prior registration or experience.
In addition to physical practice, the project hosts monthly educational meetings known as “Yum Cha,” inspired by Chinese cultural traditions. These gatherings present the health benefits of Tai Chi in accessible language, supported by current scientific evidence. They also offer a welcoming space for participants to share experiences and build collective knowledge. In the spirit of community, each meeting includes tea and shared snacks brought by participants, creating a warm, coffee-break atmosphere that fosters social bonds and mutual care.";"The community outreach project ""Tai Chi Chuan: Health and Well-being"" tackles several challenges faced by the population of Ouro Preto, including limited access to holistic health practices such as Tai Chi Chuan and Qi Gong within local healthcare and community settings. Many residents, especially older adults, face barriers such as geographic isolation, financial constraints, and a lack of awareness regarding these integrative practices. By offering free, accessible classes, the project bridges the gap between conventional healthcare and alternative approaches, promoting physical and mental health. Through regular practice, it supports disease prevention, physical rehabilitation, and emotional well-being, fostering a more inclusive and comprehensive approach to wellness within the community.";"Since its inception in 2023, the project has welcomed 105 participants aged 19 to 74 years. In its first year, the majority of participants (51.7%) were between 18 and 39 years old, reflecting a strong presence of individuals from the academic community. By 2024, however, this demographic profile shifted significantly, with 65% of participants aged 50 or older, indicating that the project’s growing visibility and outreach effectively expanded its reach within the broader Ouro Preto population.
The participant profile also reveals a notable gender distribution: women accounted for 63.3% of attendees who participated in at least one session in 2024. This majority aligns with national trends showing greater female engagement in integrative and community health initiatives.

To assess the perceived benefits of Tai Chi practice, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 21 voluntary participants. The most frequently reported outcomes included improved balance, coordination, and physical vitality, along with enhanced breathing, sleep quality, and reduced anxiety. Furthermore, 90% of participants rated the overall quality of the project as 10 out of 10, reflecting high satisfaction with the intervention.
During the monthly Yum Cha sessions, participants share benefits they have experienced in daily life, fostering a collective exchange of knowledge. These meetings also serve as an accessible platform for scientific communication with the local population, reinforcing the project’s commitment to education, dialogue, and the promotion of integrative health.
The project has also contributed to the broader health community. Notably, it participated in health-related congresses such as the Microrregional Meeting on Integrative and Complementary Health Practices held in Ouro Preto, attended by public health professionals seeking to expand their knowledge of integrative approaches.
In 2024, eleven project participants represented the group at the International Chin Woo Chinese Martial Arts Championship in Mariana. The group achieved remarkable success, winning twelve medals across Traditional Tai Chi Chuan and Shaolin Kung Fu categories, and securing 3rd place for the highest number of participants.
Furthermore, the project organized two self-defense classes tailored specifically for women and the LGBTQIAPN+ community, grounded in martial arts principles. This initiative was conducted in partnership with Andorinhas, a women’s group from UFOP, and OBSCENO, an outreach project supporting the extranormative community of Ouro Preto.";The project demonstrates that Tai Chi Chuan can serve as a valuable tool in public health initiatives, particularly when offered in accessible and inclusive community settings. For future development, expanding the program to additional neighborhoods and integrating it with primary healthcare services is recommended. Key challenges include the need to train more instructors and secure sustained funding to ensure the program’s long-term sustainability and wider impact.

It investigates the effects of Calatonia, a subtle touch technique created by Hungarian physician Pethö Sándor, on students reporting high levels of psychological suffering. The technique consists of subtle touches on the sole of the foot, nape, heel, and tendinous convergence of the triceps surae. These touches have a muscular relaxation effect (Arcuri, 2009), since these areas are provided with different dermomechanical characteristics that include neuronal integration of the field of affect and cognition (Blanchard, 2021). Sándor observed in his patients who went through the relaxation technique a homeostatic reorganization, such as changes in body temperature and breathing (Blanchard, 2022). Furthermore, he noticed that his patients began to share stories, feelings, and thoughts more spontaneously (Blanchard, 2022). These therapeutic effects—not only physical but also psychological—were the foundation of this research. For this study, the DASS-21 (Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale – 21 items) was used to classify participants´ scores in each of the three subcategories of symptoms. It was stablished that participants who´s score was classified as Severe or Extremely Severe in any of the described subescales- a total of five- were the ones selected for the Calatonia intervention. Empirically, it is known that  this technique has specially relaxing effects in cases of extreme stress, and that it´s effect wouldn´t be as significant in lower symptom level´s cases.  The application of Calatonia took a total of ten sessions for each participant, and we got the help of three volunteer applicators.;According to the DASS-21, 68% of participants' scores were classified as Severe or Extremely Severe in at least one category—and 38% had this worrying type of classification in all three types of symptomatology. Additionally, the sociodemographic questionnaire showed that all participants reported feeling stressed. When it comes to the correlation between mental suffering and the body it is important to emphasize how Anxiety, for example, is a disorder that has atypical bodily manifestations such as wide eyes and unsettled stomach (Freeman, 2015) . These physiological changes are related to the Central Nervous System and can be considered result of the Psychophysical Integration. The body of literature addressed in this study indicates a concerning scenario regarding this kind of symptomatology among university students after the COVID-19 pandemic. It is important to mention that, among psychology students, there is intense exposure to situations of extreme suffering and vulnerability. This exposure, though academically and professionally inevitable, can lead to a worsening of stress symptomatology when not properly addressed. According to Abreu (2021), there are numerous studies on the impact of stressors such as pain, suffering, and grief among medical students, for example, but not many mention psychology students—even though this group also deals with experiences of loss, significant emotional pain, and frequent social vulnerability. These phenomena highlight the relevance of this research.;All five participants reported feeling relaxed during the Calatonia sessions, a reaction to the intervention also noted by the applicators. According to Blanchard (2022), the ergotropic state (deep relaxation) promotes an ideal internal condition for physiological balance and well-being. The author also notes that spasms and eyelid twitching are the kinds of responses that indicate this relaxation response, as well as the possibility of energy reposition and, consequently, greater organism stability. Both bodily responses were observed by the applicators. Regarding the post-Calatonia DASS-21 results, the Stress average showed the most significant difference. The participants' average score, previously classified as Severe (26.2 points), was reduced by 20.2 points, reaching 6.0—a score classified as Normal. As for Anxiety levels, although there was no statistically significant reduction, it is possible to observe a meaningful change: the average score decreased from 16.4 to 6.0, which also corresponds to a Normal classification on this subscale—a reduction of 10.4 points. In the case of Depression, there was a statistically significant reduction: the average score dropped from 26.2 (Severe classification) to 8.0, a score considered Normal—an 18.2-point reduction. The initial hypothesis—that Calatonia would be more effective in cases classified as Severe or Extremely Severe—was confirmed, as well as the literature that points to subtle touch as a technique capable of producing therapeutic results.;The fact that Calatonia was applied without verbal therapy in this research suggests that the technique alone can be effective in reducing symptoms of stress and depression. However, it is plausible that, if combined with verbal psychotherapy, the outcomes could be even more promising. To strengthen the findings of this study, future research should include a broader sample of participants.;"Calatonia; stress reduction; mind-body therapies; university students"

This project seeks to build bridges of dialogue and collaborative work, allowing different and complementary perspectives to converge for a joint approach to mental health.
Mapuche medicine understands that emotional and mental symptoms precede physical illnesses, so it is a medicine that has a preventive meaning in health, as it works before the manifested imbalance spreads to the body and establishes itself as a physical illness.
Bringing this medicine to Western mental health spaces has allowed Mapuche and non-Mapuche people to access healing processes that go beyond symptom relief, with a spiritual focus, in a process whose ultimate purpose is the reconnection of the person with their spirit, allowing them to inhabit the transcendent dimension.
During 2024, 19 people from Santiago were treated in a coordinated effort between psychiatry, psychology, and Mapuche medicine. Health care was provided both in a mental health center in Santiago city and in Icalma town, in the ruka of the machi and the lawenche (Mapuche spiritual healers). Mapuche medicine is a medicine of the land, which the Machi and Lawenche perform with earth elements, which connect with spirituality. For this reason, an important part of the treatments are ceremonies held in the machi's territory, involving the patient's family, as well as the machi's community.
Cases are addressed through patient referrals, coordinating successive interventions in psychology, psychiatry, and Mapuche medicine, according to requirements.
Case follow-up is carried out through meetings where diverse perspectives converge. We worked together to comprehensively systematize three cases that have shown significant progress and have been discharged:
?A 27-year-old patient diagnosed with endogenous depression
?A 16-year-old patient diagnosed with autism and obsessive-compulsive disorder
?A 13-year-old patient diagnosed with psychosis";"Chile faces a significant demand for mental health, and conventional treatments are limited in providing real healing for people's conflicts, expressed in a set of symptoms that constitute the so-called mental health disorders.
Mapuche medicine is a spiritual and a land medicine, with a system of ancestral knowledge for the diagnosis and treatment of illnesses and for achieving a person's well-being, not just symptom relief. This medicine understands that no one heals alone, so it incorporates the family and community dimension into concrete practices. We all need to feel supported by the bonds we are part of.
This knowledge broadens the view of Western mental health, providing an order of energy and lineages and supporting profound processes that allow the healing of individuals and the reconnection with life force and spirit.";"Primarily, we built a collaborative model that integrated mental health and ancestral Mapuche medicine. This model has enabled dialogue between disciplines and knowledge, including spirituality and the ancestral perspective on conflicts expressed in mental-emotional and spiritual symptoms in people.
Recognizing and defining the areas of expertise for each practice and generating spaces for coordination, has allowed for the co-construction of diagnoses that complement the perspectives of psychiatry, psychology, and Mapuche medicine. The treatments were ordered and complemented as follows: psychological, for emotional and mental aspects; psychiatric management, for invasive and debilitating symptoms; and with Mapuche medicine working on the energetic and spiritual aspects, including ancestry for the ordering of lineages and allowing people to return to their roots and essential strength. Follow-up of the interventions was done through monthly clinical meetings, that allowed us to examine the entire treatment process, exchange perspectives, and understand that we are all looking at the same person from different perspectives and understandings. This has given rise to new understandings, since the process of restoring emotional, mental, and spiritual balance in a person is a complex process that requires various interventions, where family support is a determining factor in sustaining treatment.";"We would like to incorporate other mental health professionals who are currently undergoing treatment with Mapuche medicine, as direct experience allows us to understand its depth and it´s contributions to mental health work.
We seek to make the treatments sustainable, so that Mapuche and non-Mapuche people, from different territories and without financial resources, can access, sustain the treatments and receive the different forms of care that Mapuche ancestral medicine involves. This approach works from the individual to the family and community, requiring multiple actions and actors.
The treatments can last several months or even a year, and involve various ceremonies and treatment techniques that require the participation of numerous people, which entails high costs, often unaffordable for many families.
Because this is a medicine deeply connected to the land, it is urgently necessary to have cultivation sites for plants, herbs, and trees used in the treatments.";"Traditional Mapuche Medicine; mental health; Intercultural Medicine Model"

As part of the course, a welcoming space was created to integrate the Decalogue of Positive Mental Health through the use of Integrative and Complementary Health Practices (PICS). The course was based on the Multifactorial Model of Positive Mental Health (MMSM+), initially proposed by Jahoda (1958) and later expanded by Lluch-Canut (1999), along with the Decalogue proposed by Lluch (2020). 

The MMSM+ defines Positive Mental Health (PMH) as a construct resulting from a combination of personal and psychosocial resources. It is a dynamic and fluctuating state that encompasses both positive and negative feelings, thoughts, and behaviors, enabling individuals to feel and function at their best within their particular life circumstances (LLUCH, 2020). The six factors that compose the PMH model are: Personal Satisfaction, Prosocial Attitude, Self-Control, Autonomy, Problem Solving, and Interpersonal Relationship Skills.

The Decalogue of Positive Mental Health consists of the following ten recommendations:
1.	Value the positive aspects of life, both personal and professional;
2.	Carry out daily activities with dedication and affection;
3.	Avoid overly rigid self-judgment or judgment of others, cultivating tolerance, understanding, and flexibility;
4.	Do not let negative emotions hinder personal development;
5.	Be aware of and appreciate good moments as they happen;
6.	Allow yourself to experience and express emotions, understanding that different feelings are normal (do not fear crying or feeling);
7.	Seek spaces and activities that promote mental relaxation;
8.	Face problems as they arise, adopting an active stance toward adversity;
9.	Nurture interpersonal relationships both in personal and professional spheres;
10.	Use humor frequently as a coping strategy and a way to promote well-being.

To plan, implement, and evaluate the activities that articulated PICS with the ten recommendations of the Decalogue, the following actions were taken: a critical review of the Decalogue and of evidence-based strategies from the Mentis Plus+ program for promoting positive mental health; welcoming activities linked to the experience of a specific PICS; and the use of a Positive Mental Health Journal, in which students were invited to record their thoughts, experiences, and resources related to the Decalogue.

It is important to highlight that since the approval of the National Policy on Integrative and Complementary Practices (PNPIC) in 2006 (Ordinance GM/MS No. 971), these practices have gained visibility and expanded. In 2017, Ordinance GM/MS No. 849 increased the number of PICS modalities to 19, including art therapy, Ayurveda, meditation, and yoga, among others. In 2018, Ordinance GM/MS No. 702 added ten more practices, totaling 29 PICS offered through the Brazilian Unified Health System (SUS).

In the Positive Mental Health course, the following PICS were used: meditation, Reiki, Liang Gong, Integrative Community Therapy, aromatherapy, auriculotherapy, and circular dance. At the end of the course, these experiences were shared in a collective moment of reflection on what was lived and learned throughout the course.";"While access to and permanence in higher education are considered major achievements, the academic journey also brings significant physical, socioeconomic, cultural, and emotional challenges that may affect students’ mental health in different ways (Costa & Moreira, 2016; Gomes LMLDS et al., 2023). In recent decades, concern with university students’ mental health has become increasingly prominent in higher education and public health policies (UNESCO, 2021; WHO, 2022).

In this context, the presented strategy incorporates integrative practices and the study of positive mental health as a means to promote well-being among graduate students.";"The experience of using integrative practices alongside the study of positive mental health to promote well-being among graduate students yielded the following results:

•	100% of students were able to engage in personal self-assessment through the Positive Mental Health Journal;

•	Participants acknowledged the potential of PICS to promote positive mental health, as highlighted throughout the course;

•	91% of participants reported that the course significantly contributed to their development in terms of self-care and well-being, while the remainder evaluated the contribution as moderate.

In light of the Multifactorial Model of Positive Mental Health (MMSM+), it was observed that the integration of PICS with the Decalogue helped to strengthen the six core factors of the model.";This experience showed that integrating Integrative and Complementary Health Practices (PICS) with the Decalogue of Positive Mental Health strengthens graduate students' self-care and well-being. Therefore, it is recommended to maintain and expand such initiatives, both within the university community and among professionals working in the Brazilian Unified Health System (SUS). It is essential to invest in faculty training and to encourage interdisciplinary research on this subject.

In Brazil, the National Policy on Integrative and Complementary Practices in Health (PNPIC) has supported the inclusion of such practices since 2006, although implementation remains uneven (BRASIL, 2018). This experience took place at a Family Health Clinic located in a central and densely populated area of Rio de Janeiro, marked by social vulnerability and high demand for mental health and pain-related care. The outpatient clinic was implemented in November 2024 by a physician preceptor of the Family and Community Medicine Residency Program (SMS-RJ), with formal training in TCM from the Fluminense Federal University (UFF) and certified as an instructor in the “Acupuncture for Primary Care Physicians” course (AMAB), promoted by UFSC and the Brazilian Ministry of Health (UNIVERSIDADE FEDERAL DE SANTA CATARINA, 2024). The team included medical residents and multiprofessional residents in nursing, physiotherapy, and physical education. The service provided acupuncture, auriculotherapy, moxibustion, and cupping therapy weekly, with each shift structured to receive up to three users. Sessions included shared anamnesis, clinical reasoning, and supervised therapeutic procedures. Patients with musculoskeletal pain were also referred to existing physical activity programs and therapeutic groups (for cervical, lumbar, shoulder, and knee pain) within the PHC unit.;"Primary Health Care (PHC) faces high demand for chronic conditions such as pain, insomnia, anxiety, and headaches. The conventional response, often centered on medicalization, fails to address the subjective and social dimensions of illness. The lack of structured spaces for the teaching and practice of Traditional, Complementary, and Integrative Medicine (TCIM) also hampers its application by professionals in training. Given this challenge, the team was able to schedule only three assessments per week. Although Brazil’s National Curriculum Guidelines call for comprehensive and humanized medical education (BRASIL, 2014), TCIM practices still occupy a marginal place in medical curricula, often addressed as elective topics without real integration into clinical practice. Furthermore, the integration of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) into conventional healthcare still faces obstacles such as the scarcity of robust scientific evidence, institutional resistance, regulatory barriers, and a lack of standardized professional training (WHO, 2023; MAYO CLINIC, 2024; UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA, 2024).

Another barrier encountered was managing follow-up appointments, as TCM care may require 8 to 10 follow-up visits depending on the chronicity of the patient’s condition. To address this issue, the preceptor—who also served as the support supervisor for the residency program—chose to use the TCIM outpatient clinic schedule exclusively for initial evaluations, during which the therapeutic plan would be defined in collaboration with the patient, Family and Community Medicine residents, and the interprofessional team. It was then established that follow-up visits would be conducted by the residents themselves during the scheduled care shifts of the Family Health Team. To ensure autonomy and safety, the preceptor remained available to observe and discuss the follow-up visits within all family health teams. This strategy proved effective in expanding access to TCIM consultations in the health unit and in multiplying knowledge and familiarity with these practices.";"This initiative demonstrated the pedagogical and clinical value of TCIM in PHC training environments. The outpatient clinic enhanced clinical reasoning, active listening, and a person-centered approach. The collaborative practice with multiprofessional residents fostered comprehensive therapeutic planning (FEUERWERKER; SENA, 2002). Practical-theoretical training and supervised clinical activity promoted situated learning, rooted in real-life contexts and local health needs. Users reported symptomatic relief and feeling welcomed and cared for. As a result, a new training program for nurses in Programmatic Area 1.0 is being developed in partnership with the TCIM Coordination Office of SMS-RJ to expand and sustain integrative care.";"It is recommended that similar outpatient clinics be implemented in other PHC units, ensuring proper training, supervision, and integration with local networks. Strategic professionals such as nurses and multiprofessional teams should be targeted for training to ensure capillarity and sustainability. The consolidation of TCIM in health education demands investment in research, clear regulation, and institutional support (WHO, 2023; BRASIL, 2018).";"Integrative and complementary health practices; Traditional Chinese Medicine; Health Workforce Training; Primary Health Care; Medical education"

This institution is always open to developing innovative and challenging academic programs to fulfill the unmet requirements of professionals already working, particularly through its School of Medicine, where there are a lot of postgraduate courses and diploma certifications available. In particular, we identified that integrative medicine is still an underdeveloped area in LMIC like Ecuador, where there is an important divergence between homeopathy and occidental medicine, although traditional (ancestral medicine) is well recognized, even by the constitutional law.;After a profound analysis of the academic offer in Ecuador, we concluded that the main reason for that divergence is the lack of formal academic programs where physicians interested in integrative medicine might be trained and certified. Therefore, based on the current programs offered by other institutions in the region, we developed a challenging but concrete curriculum to cover all aspects of integrative medicine, from the basic concept up to the clinical practice. It was a hybrid program composed of ten modules to accomplish a total of 108 hours over six months. Those ten modules were covered by 30 instructors, most of them with an international qualification and years of experience.;"After almost two years of preparation, we were able to launch our ""Diploma training course in integrative medicine"", which was adopted by 40 physicians all around the country. It was a very interesting experience because every session, the participation was increasing, and the exchange of experiences and criteria was enriching the knowledge acquisition by the participants. Although some of the sessions were exhausting, no participant declined during their conduct. Periodical examinations were also applied to warranty that participants were compromised with the academic standard required by the university. Finally, 36 of those initial participants approved the program and got their qualification. ";After this initial successful experience, we are convinced that it was a good idea to launch this program and will continue on a routine basis offering it. Surely will be necessary to review the faculty list and the length of the topic analyzed, as well as to increase the practical activities to maximize the improvement of technical skills by the participants. ;"xintegrative medicine; Academic Training; LMIC; "

The current Brazilian social and political context, marked by multiple public health crises, the experience of a pandemic, and the psychosocial effects of isolation, discrimination, and loneliness, has accentuated the population’s physical and emotional distress. In this context, individual-based health responses are insufficient for coping with the complexity of collective suffering. While the clinical-hegemonic model falls short, collective care presents itself as a possible path, though professionals often lack preparation to act within this model.
Integrative Community Therapy (ICT/TCI) is a recognized psychosocial practice by the Ministry of Health, carried out through therapeutic circles in open spaces, aimed at building social support networks that promote life, strengthen resilience, and mobilize individual, family, and community resources. It is not psychotherapy, but a therapeutic act that can be applied in various contexts and stages of life. It is based on community knowledge and supports the strengthening of social bonds, emotional support, the sharing of life experiences, and the reduction of social isolation.
Since 2017, ICT/TCI has been included in the National Policy for Integrative and Complementary Practices (PNPIC) of the Unified Health System (SUS). It is a transversal policy across all levels of care, with a strong presence in Primary Health Care (PHC), and integrates a set of therapeutic resources for disease prevention, health promotion, and recovery.
ICT offers a safe and open space for the exchange of knowledge and experiences, fostering bonds, autonomy, and the transformation of vulnerability into power. It strengthens community resilience, enables new meanings for pain, crises, and losses, and celebrates growth and victories.
Given this context, we developed a training course and structured a training center. It is the first officially recognized ICT Training Center operating within the SUS and funded by it. Created by the Municipality of Campinas, the training model is unprecedented and enables the sustainability, replication, and scaling of this care strategy as a public policy.

DESCRIPTION 
This is a training course for employees of the Municipal Health Department (and potentially in the future, from other departments such as Education) in Integrative Community Therapy, with a total workload of 240 hours. This includes theoretical content, supervised practice of therapeutic circles at the beginning of the course, and experiential activities aimed at preparing, caring for, and transforming these public workers.";Theoretical pillars of ICT, ICT Circles, Experiential Activities, Supervisions.;"RESULTS
Two groups of Integrative Community Therapists were trained between 2023 and 2025. The first group had 26 students, and the second had 34 — all employees of the Campinas Municipal Health Department. It is worth noting that in the selection of course candidates, the main criterion recommended to managers was the suitability of the candidate’s profile for this kind of collective care. Preference was given to professionals in direct contact with the community. A university degree was not required, giving prominence to Community Health Workers and Nursing Technicians, alongside Psychologists, Occupational Therapists, Nurses, and other professionals with higher education. All participants committed to replicating the therapeutic circles in their communities, which has already been happening in a significant and impactful way.";"Due to logistical considerations, we are considering adopting a hybrid format (in-person and online) for future courses.

The municipality of Campinas, known for its strong public health tradition and commitment to social participation, has advanced the implementation of Integrative and Complementary Practices in Health (PICS) by establishing a Training Center for Integrative Community Therapy (ICT) within the local Unified Health System (SUS). ICT is a practice officially recognized by the National Policy on Integrative and Complementary Practices (PNPIC). After a period of reduced ICT practice circles due to staff changes, the post-pandemic context brought new challenges and opportunities. Between 2021 and 2022, the arrival of new professionals trained in ICT and the need to address the emotional distress of the population fostered the revival and strengthening of this practice and the creation of a certified training center.

DESCRIPTION:
Campinas is home to a population of 1,139,047 people¹. In the 1970s, the city stood out as a pioneer in expanding the basic health care network.
Currently, the Municipal Health Department (SMS) is organized into six health districts and operates an extensive Primary Health Care network, consisting of 69 Basic Health Units (UBSs) under the Family Health Strategy model. This network is supported by Multiprofessional Teams in Primary Care (eMulti)², Psychosocial Care Centers (CAPS), and Home Care Services³.
In 2001, the “Body in Movement” Project was launched, focusing on a user-centered care model. With the implementation of the National Policy on Integrative and Complementary Practices in the SUS (PNPIC)?, several practices and methods were incorporated, such as Postural Gymnastics, Lian Gong in 18 Therapies, homeopathy, acupuncture, circular dance, meditation, yoga, auriculotherapy, phytotherapy, osteopathy, and Integrative Community Therapy (ICT).
ICT is a collective therapeutic practice that promotes the construction of supportive social networks, the strengthening of bonds, and improved quality of life. It has been officially recognized by the PNPIC since 2017?.
In Campinas, ICT began in 2006 with a visit from Professor Adalberto de Paula Barreto — psychiatrist and creator of ICT — who led an awareness activity with health professionals. Between 2008 and 2009, some public servants were trained by the Araraquara-São Carlos Training Center. Over time, however, retirements and staff changes led to a reduction in these therapy circles, although they were never fully discontinued³.";"PROBLEMS ADDRESSED:
The reduction in ICT offerings highlighted the need to restore and strengthen the practice within the network. Between 2021 and 2022, new professionals joined SMS, some already trained in ICT. In response to the growing physical and emotional suffering of the population in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, ICT emerged as a valuable tool for support and care.
Amid this scenario, the desire arose to resume training in ICT and establish a certified Training Center — institutions authorized to offer ICT training and/or courses in Self-Esteem Recovery Techniques (TRA). SMS representatives consulted the Brazilian Association of Integrative Community Therapy (ABRATECOM)? for accreditation guidelines and mapped professionals in the network trained in ICT.
To accredit a Training Center, a work plan must be submitted along with a team of at least three trainers certified in both ICT and TRA. The mapping identified six community therapists in the network, only one of whom was certified in TRA, while another was still in training. To meet accreditation requirements, a partnership was established with the Araraquara/UNESP Training Center.
Thus, a steering group was formed, composed of five career public servants from SMS — all trained in ICT, two also certified in TRA — along with the support of a therapist from the Araraquara Center. The group developed the training curriculum based on their experiences, knowledge, and lived practice, and each member became responsible for different course modules.
The training was conducted in accordance with ABRATECOM’s criteria, officially consolidating the SUS Campinas Training Center. Campinas thus became the first certified SUS Training Center for Community Therapists in Brazil.";"RESULTS:
The SUS Campinas Training Center is composed of career public servants from SMS, who work on the project as part of their regular work schedule.
Two training cohorts in ICT have already been offered to Primary Health Care professionals in Campinas. The first ran from October 2022 to December 2023 and graduated 26 community therapists. The second cohort began in April 2024 and will conclude in May 2025, training 32 new therapists.";"RECOMMENDATIONS
Teamwork has been a defining feature of the creation of the SUS Campinas Center. With official recognition as a Training Center, SMS gained autonomy in the education of community therapists, strengthening humanized care and contributing to the promotion of a culture of peace. Additionally, the Center allows for the formation of teams with appropriately qualified professionals, promotes care for the staff themselves, optimizes human resources, and responds promptly to the needs of services and territories — especially the most vulnerable.
This experience has highlighted the value of interprofessional collaborative work: members of the steering group, initially unfamiliar with each other and coming from different areas, learned to work together with respect, active listening, and cooperation. Finally, each training cycle carries deep symbolism, values, and learning. Overcoming the challenges faced by the steering group at each stage has only strengthened their commitment to promoting collective and integrative care within SUS Campinas.

To debate the challenges in service management for the implementation of PICS in PHC.
Methodology & Content: The LU features a robust syllabus covering the guiding concepts and rationales of PICS and Traditional, Complementary, and Integrative Medicines (TCIM), their history, advancements, and challenges, as well as the approach to care from a multiprofessional perspective in PHC. A central point of the training is the discussion on the organization and management of the work process, aiming to integrate PICS into the agenda of multiprofessional teams in Basic Health Units. This professional training provides information and facilitates debate on the main PICS modalities offered in PHC. It also aims to qualify information about various articulation spaces (institutional, virtual networks, and strategic sites) and promote the sharing of municipal, state, and federal management experiences regarding PICS offerings in PHC.
Throughout the LU, various PICS modalities are addressed, many with practical experiences, such as Floral Therapy, Auriculotherapy, Aromatherapy, Meditation, Traditional Chinese Medicine (with Lian Gong), and Reflexology. There is also a significant focus on the interface of PICS with Mental Health, including a workshop on Care Pathways and an Integrative Community Therapy Circle. Phytotherapy, encompassing the National Policy on Medicinal Plants and Phytotherapeutics and Popular Health Education, is also covered. The program is enriched by a vast bibliography, including mandatory and complementary readings for each class. This includes official documents from the Ministry of Health (such as the PNPIC and its ordinances for the inclusion of new practices), scientific articles from renowned journals, books, and multimedia resources (ObservaPICS podcasts, webinars, and YouTube videos).";" Challenges and difficulties encountered in the implementation and integration of PICS:
Engagement difficulties among residents or healthcare teams.
Challenges in integrating PICS into the daily routines of health services.
Resistance from professionals or managers.
Limitations of resources (human, financial, and material) for the practices.
Logistical problems (e.g., scheduling, inadequate spaces).
Discrepancies between the theory and practice of PICS within the SUS (Unified Health System).
Difficulties in the regulation or acceptance of certain PICS modalities.";"The Learning Unit (LU) demonstrated a comprehensive and well-structured approach to PICS education.
Program Scope and Structure:
LU V was conducted from July 15 to August 26, 2025, totaling 120 hours of workload.
The unit was taught once a week, comprising 40 synchronous hours and 20 asynchronous hours per week.
The program was intensive and diversified, combining in-person classes with asynchronous activities, which included readings and the preparation of reviews of scientific texts on PICS.
Content and Focus:
The syllabus effectively covered guiding concepts and rationales of PICS and Traditional, Complementary, and Integrative Medicines (TCIM), their history, advancements, and challenges.
It also addressed the multiprofessional approach to care in PHC and the organization and management of the work process for integrating PICS into multiprofessional teams in Basic Health Units.
Key PICS modalities were addressed, often with practical experiences, including Floral Therapy, Auriculotherapy, Aromatherapy, Meditation, Traditional Chinese Medicine (with Lian Gong), and Reflexology.
A significant focus was placed on the interface of PICS with Mental Health, featuring a workshop on Care Pathways and an Integrative Community Therapy Circle. Phytotherapy, the National Policy on Medicinal Plants and Phytotherapeutics, and Popular Health Education were also covered.
Discussions included the management and indicators of PICS, as well as the challenges of managing and implementing PICS at state and municipal levels in Rio de Janeiro.
Evaluative Outcome:
As an evaluative assignment, students presented seminars on 'PICS and Professional Councils.' This involved research into the legislation and standardization of PICS modalities from the PNPIC (National Policy on Integrative and Complementary Practices) within Professional Councils (Regional and Federal) for the 14 health professional categories recognized by the National Health Council (CNS).";"Based on the experience with this Learning Unit (LU), the following recommendations are put forth:
Improvements to the curriculum or the practical activities of the LU should be considered.
Ways to expand the LU's offering to other residency programs or institutions should be explored.
Lessons Learned & Conclusion: A key lesson learned is that including this PICS Learning Unit within a residency program significantly contributes to the advancement of knowledge in PICS and health education. It is concluded that the PICS Learning Unit within a residency program holds substantial potential to offer in-depth and practical training on PICS. This empowers Residents working in Primary Health Care (PHC) to integrate these practices into comprehensive health care, fostering a critical perspective on their implementation, management, and regulation within the Unified Health System (SUS).";"Professional Training; Complementary Therapies; primary care; Public Health; Internado y Residencia"

Among 123 participants, 98.4% demonstrated meaningful improvement in at least one domain, with significant reductions in stress (74% improved), anxiety (71.5% improved), and enhanced energy (66.7% improved) and emotional control (62.6% improved). Results support breathwork integration into complementary medicine for population wellness.
";"Primary challenges included widespread chronic stress and autonomic dysregulation manifesting as anxiety, emotional reactivity, cognitive dysfunction, and reduced vitality. Traditional approaches focus on symptom management rather than physiological imbalances, necessitating root-cause interventions.

Implementation barriers included participant skepticism about breathing effectiveness, time management difficulties during stressful periods, and technical mastery challenges with coherent breathing timing. Resource limitations required creative adaptations for diverse socioeconomic contexts. Institutional resistance necessitated extensive education about breathwork's scientific foundation.

Solutions included comprehensive facilitator training, flexible protocols adaptable to individual circumstances, gradual progression building confidence, and community support elements normalizing challenges while celebrating successes.";"Quantitative outcomes demonstrated remarkable effectiveness. Stress decreased from 3.93 to 2.95 points (25% improvement, 74% achieving meaningful reduction). Anxiety improved from 3.99 to 2.97 (25.6% enhancement, 71.5% positive response). Mental clarity increased from 3.21 to 4.02 (25.2% improvement, 61.8% meaningful gains). Energy showed largest improvements, rising from 3.20 to 4.15 (29.7% enhancement, 66.7% improvement). Emotional control improved from 3.27 to 4.10 (25.4% enhancement, 62.6% better regulation).

Most significantly, 98.4% improved in at least one domain, with 57.7% showing enhancement across four or more dimensions. Effect sizes (Cohen's d: 0.44-0.51) indicated moderate-to-large clinical significance comparable to established interventions.

Qualitative feedback revealed enhanced self-awareness, immediate stress relief, improved sleep, and increased resilience. Participants described techniques as ""reset buttons"" enabling proactive stress management. Excellent safety profile with no serious adverse events and high satisfaction rates.";"Evidence supports healthcare integration as preventive and therapeutic approaches. Primary care providers should teach basic techniques during visits, providing immediate stress tools. Educational institutions should implement breathing practices supporting student wellness and learning capacity. Workplace programs represent ideal contexts given immediate stress relief and emotional regulation benefits.

Future research should include randomized controlled trials with physiological measures and long-term follow-up evaluating sustainability. Dose-response investigations could optimize protocols for different populations.

Teaching the teacher in teaching is a challenge to be embraced by all health professionals, being improved by the Integrated Curriculum of Anthroposophical Medicine (ICURAM).;In this context, the present work aimed to bring the experience and perception of the proposing preceptor professor in relation to the use of the combination of CS and AM in the context of the improvement of other professors of the otorhinolaryngology residency program at FMJ, as well as in the training of residents. Both theories are used in classes, experiences and in patient care, under the teaching supervision of the preceptor, who is a specialist in neurosurgery with international certification to practice AM.;"At the Jundiaí School of Medicine (FMJ), where this study was conducted, the otorhinolaryngology residency program was created in 1976, and was the institution's first medical residency program. Its focus is on the FMJ's specialty outpatient clinic, the University Hospital, the São Vicente Charity Hospital, the Jundiaí Regional Hospital, and the Therapeutic Association for Auditory and Language Stimulation (ATEAL). 
The otorhinolaryngology  residency program  at FMJ  has been strongly based on the CS opened to inclusion of AM pratices. During their activities, the resident acts as the protagonist in a multidisciplinary training. The educational activities highlight the particularities of the service, such as the resident's responsibilities at the hospital level, in patient care and community health awareness campaigns. The approach supports the resident's work on several fronts, always with transparency and with the broad repertoire of tools at their disposal.
In this context, the preceptor guide the student in the following topics:
- Construction of new meanings. Preceptors must act so that residents seek a “new synthesis”, which encompasses particularities of the health care process, taking into account the holistic vision and the dimension of patient safety, in addition to ethical precepts.
- Evaluation of process and products. Highlight the importance of verbal formative assessment at the end of each resident activity, with self-assessment, peer assessment and the assessment that they will make of the preceptor staff, enabling preceptor work to be carried out with greater confidence regarding the need to delve deeper into the identification of the clinical problem. The knowledge from ICURAM was added to provide the preceptor staff with an integrated action that includes the resident's strategy to develop the following attributes:
· Know how to approach the patient in an ethical and humane manner.
· Identify diseases based on clinical and armed propaedeutics.
· Formulate differential diagnoses of prevalent diseases.
· Identify appropriate therapeutic guidelines.
· Perform correct referrals, avoiding incompetence and recklessness.
· Properly fill out all medical documentation.
· Comply with the complete clinical and surgical protocol for health care in our specialty.
In each activity, the staff of preceptors is led to encourage residents to self-evaluate and self-regulate in their practical skills, valuing the knowledge they already have. Thus, the student has the opportunity to reflect on their actions and, in their interface with the preceptor and the daily routine of the medical residency, develop new potentials for their field of activity.

This experience led to an integrative and multidisciplinary formation that has been shown differential and efficient ways to approach different healthcare conditions, both in private or public health context.";"The role of educators in different areas is to exchange, build and rebuild knowledge in order to form active individuals in society, committed to their professions and objectives. Education goes far beyond training and conditioning someone to certain skills.
The preceptor teacher, in turn, tends to transmit everything he or she knows to the resident, which is not sufficient for the essence of learning, and is far from the meaning of learning, especially considering areas of healthcare.
Exposing the relevant aspects of the teaching-learning process tends to make the resident more independent in the construction of knowledge, so the preceptor must be able to sensitively identify the resident's level of understanding. The expansion of the concept of education in the training of resident physicians must move from an exclusive process of acquiring knowledge or skills (based on the simple and pure exposure of content and techniques) to the development of a professional critical awareness, which has been shown to be beneficially expanded by the use of the concepts of the integrated curriculum of AM and CS.
One of the main challengers is to include effectively the practices of AM and CS in the different medical residency programs, which certainly will chance the scenery of public healthcare in Brazil.";"Medical residency; preceptor training; constructivist spiral; ICURAM curriculum; antrhroposophic medicine"

This retrospective study describes the experience of 25 patients with various types of cancer who were treated with the Okada-style Integrated Health System (S.I.S.e.O) as a complement to conventional medical treatments.
The S.I.S.e.O combines practices such as Johrei (energy channeling), the appreciation of beauty, and natural nutrition to promote holistic well-being. Clinical variables, disease progression, survival, and quality of life were analyzed. 
The results suggest that this complementary intervention contributes to the relief of physical, emotional, and spiritual suffering and improves quality of life during and after cancer treatment.";"Limitations include:
•	Loss to follow-up in some cases
•	Lack of a control group
•	Retrospective and descriptive nature of the study
Still, the results invite us to consider more human-centered care models with multidimensional support, integrating medical treatment with more holistic therapies.";"Results
1.	The evaluated group included patients with various types and stages of cancer, from children to elderly adults. Many were in advanced or metastatic stages.
2.	The cases involved adenocarcinomas (rectal, breast, colon, pancreatic), carcinomas (tongue, cervix, parotid), lymphomas (T-cell and non-Hodgkin), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (A.L.L.), and sarcomas. Most were undergoing aggressive multimodal treatments such as major surgery, radiotherapy, polychemotherapy, and hormone therapy.
3.	Due to the severity of their conditions and the potential disabling element, patients experienced significant symptoms such as chronic pain, fatigue, nausea, insomnia, anxiety, anguish and depressive episodes. In this context, the S.I.S.e.O. was a complementary intervention to alleviate the emotional and physical burdens.
4.	It was possible to analyze subjective life quality expressed in words frequently repeated, such as changes, relaxation, peace, improvements in anguish and fears, gratitude, and spiritual and physical well-being, them being the most representative and quality of life reinsured by the treating doctor. 

Summary of Patient Comments (Subjective Perception of S.I.S.e.O. Effects)
Patient testimonials reflected a broadly positive perception of S.I.S.e.O. as a complementary tool in their medical treatment:
•	Emotional well-being: Several patients reported feeling more relaxed, uplifted, or energized after sessions. Common phrases included ""it relaxes me,"" ""I feel relaxed and energized,"" or ""very uplifted.""
•	Psycho-spiritual support: Some described the S.I.S.e.O. as providing support during difficult times, e.g., ""a spiritual and physical support"" or ""a light of hope.""
•	Therapeutic aid: It was noted as ""a significant help in getting through treatment"".
•	No adverse effects: Nearly all patients reported ""no significant side effects,"" indicating tolerability.
•	Physical symptom relief: Frequently reported relief from pain, reduced nausea and vomiting, improved sleep and appetite.";"The analysis of these 25 cases suggests that a comprehensive medical approach may be associated with prolonged survival and a positive perception of quality of life. The patients’ expressions of peace, relief from distress, and sense of meaning point to the importance of addressing the physical, emotional, and spiritual dimensions.
These findings support the need to continue scientifically exploring and validating the Okada Style Integrated Health System as a complement to conventional medical care.";"Mokichi Okada; cancer; Wellbeing; Energy Channeling; Self healing capacity"

The target population consists mostly of women with fibromyalgia referred from the chronic pain clinic. As a chronic and multifactorial condition, fibromyalgia is often neglected due to its lack of visible physical markers, requiring a comprehensive and humanized care approach.
The protocol spans 12 weeks, with weekly three-hour sessions divided between educational activities and practical experiences. The interventions are based on an integrative view of health (physical, emotional, spiritual, social, and planetary), Lifestyle Medicine, PICS, and Social Care Technologies. Practices include aromatherapy, auriculotherapy, herbal medicine, meditation, healthy eating, forgiveness workshops, integrative community therapy, tai chi chuan, restorative justice circles, music therapy, and group dynamics.
The team comprises a psychologist, physician, nurse, pharmacist, physiotherapist, multiprofessional residents, and, depending on the semester, a nutritionist, occupational therapist, and physical education professional. ASI, as a teaching-assistance space, facilitates the integration of education, research, outreach, and health services, strengthening training in health and the effectiveness of the SUS.";The main needs identified among participants include: severe chronic pain, fatigue, emotional distress, lack of empathetic care and qualified listening in health services, social isolation, excessive medicalization, and low self-esteem. The fragmentation of care and the disease-centered biomedical model have proven insufficient in addressing the complexity of illness. The absence of strong therapeutic bonds exacerbates the sense of abandonment. FloreSer proposes a person-centered, community-based, and network-connected care approach, fostering transformation through listening, belonging, and empowerment.;"The FloreSer Program showed significant and lasting impacts on participants’ lives, with consistent improvements in physical, emotional, social, and behavioral aspects. The 12-week multimodal and multiprofessional therapeutic protocol, based on PICS and health education, promoted self-care and contributed to pain relief and increased perception of well-being.
Participants reported improved mood, sleep quality, self-esteem, and motivation for lifestyle changes. Techniques such as foot baths, aromatherapy, conscious breathing, healthy eating, walking, and Integrative Community Therapy (ICT) circles became part of their daily routines, promoting autonomy and empowerment. The forgiveness workshop and other symbolic experiences led to deep emotional reframing and reconnection with life purpose.
Quantitatively, one study revealed a statistically significant increase in the average self-care scores in the intervention group (IG), from 49.58 to 57.25 by the end of the protocol (p = 0.008). In the control group (CG), the change from 54.33 to 54.67 was not statistically significant (p = 0.867). Additionally, studies developed within two undergraduate theses and two master’s dissertations indicated that the self-care benefits were sustained even one year after the intervention, demonstrating the program’s lasting impact.";To ensure the continuity and expansion of initiatives like FloreSer, it is recommended that PICS and social technologies be institutionally recognized within health management. It is necessary to address cultural and epistemological resistance within teams and to expand integrative practice training in health-related academic programs. Key challenges include securing stable funding, valuing multiprofessional work, and systematically monitoring the program's impacts, with support from management, educational institutions, and social control mechanisms.;"Fibromyalgia; Culturally Appropriate Technology; Complementary Therapies; Unified Health System"

Created by psychiatrist Adalberto de Paula Barreto, ICT responded to the lack of access to mental health care and emotional support in marginalized territories impacted by poverty, violence, and exclusion. It is based on five theoretical pillars: Systemic Thinking, Cultural Anthropology, Paulo Freire’s Pedagogy, Resilience Theory, and Complex Thinking, offering a holistic and humanizing view of suffering and healing.

ICT is implemented across a variety of settings, especially in vulnerable areas such as peripheral urban neighborhoods, rural zones, Indigenous and Quilombola communities, shelters, prisons, schools, universities, and health services. It has been institutionalized within Brazil’s Unified Health System (SUS) and recognized as an official Integrative and Complementary Health Practice (PICS) through Ordinance No. 2,326/2024. The method is now used in over 1,500 municipalities in Brazil and more than 40 countries in Latin America, Africa, Europe, and Asia.

The central method of ICT is the ""therapy circle,"" a structured group meeting facilitated by trained community therapists. Each session follows five steps: (1) welcoming, (2) selection of a concern, (3) contextualization, (4) shared life experiences, and (5) symbolic closure. The process values horizontality, mutual respect, cultural diversity, and collective wisdom. Rather than offering advice or diagnosis, ICT invites participants to listen, share, and recognize their inner strengths.

Initially designed for in-person practice, ICT was quickly adapted to virtual formats during the COVID-19 pandemic. Online circles preserved the core methodology and created therapeutic spaces for people experiencing anxiety, grief, loneliness, and violence. Participants from across Brazil—and beyond—connected to listen and support each other. This transition expanded ICT’s reach and intercultural exchange potential.

In Brazil, ICT is often implemented through partnerships involving universities, public health services, NGOs, and local governments. A key example is the Integrative Health Outpatient Clinic (ASI) at the State University of Ponta Grossa (UEPG), in southern Brazil. ASI integrates ICT with other practices like auriculotherapy, phytotherapy, meditation, and healing circles, offering care to women with fibromyalgia, mothers of children in neonatal ICUs, and health workers experiencing burnout.

The Brazilian context reflects the limitations of a health system still dominated by the biomedical model, with insufficient psychosocial care and long waitlists for specialized services. ICT addresses these gaps by offering a low-cost, high-impact alternative that strengthens listening, community ties, and autonomy.

In the territories where ICT is active, structural challenges such as poverty, violence, and social disintegration are common. ICT restores the value of community dialogue, fostering belonging, hope, and resilience. It does not replace clinical treatment but complements it by involving people in their own healing journey and transforming pain into collective meaning.

Cultural adaptability is another strength. ICT respects local identities and values diverse forms of knowledge, including oral traditions and community memory. It is practiced in Indigenous villages, favelas, and rural communities, always adapting without losing its essence.

ICT’s growth has also inspired policy and advocacy efforts. It has been included in health worker training, integrated into social programs, and presented at international forums as a model of humanized, democratic care. It has even been applied in conflict mediation contexts, such as supporting Ukrainian and Russian communities or refugee populations in Africa.

Despite its successes, ICT faces challenges. Many circles rely on volunteer efforts, and resistance from traditional, hierarchical health models persists. Digital exclusion also limits the reach of online formats in some regions. Overcoming these obstacles requires institutional commitment, continued training, sustainable funding, and the integration of community-based care into health policies.

In sum, ICT offers an accessible and transformative response to the emotional suffering exacerbated by inequality and the pandemic. As a Brazilian social technology, it contributes to global mental health efforts, reaffirms the power of collective healing, and promotes equity, participation, and peace.";"Excessive medicalization of human suffering, especially where emotional distress is treated primarily with medication instead of holistic approaches;

Lack of qualified listening spaces within SUS, leaving many individuals feeling unheard and unsupported;

Social isolation and weakened support networks, worsened by the COVID-19 pandemic and structural inequalities;

Stigma related to mental health and vulnerability, which discourages people from seeking help and sharing experiences;

Low interprofessional integration in health services, limiting coordinated and effective responses to complex mental health demands.

ICT offers a concrete, low-cost, community-based, and integrative alternative. It restores the value of lived experience, promotes autonomy and resilience, and strengthens social empowerment through inclusive, culturally sensitive, and non-hierarchical spaces that foster participation, belonging, and collective healing.";"
Numerous studies have demonstrated ICT's effectiveness. In a study with 65 participants during the pandemic, significant improvements were observed in psychological well-being, interpersonal relationships, environmental mastery, and life purpose (REIS et al., 2025). In a university hospital setting, ICT combined with auriculotherapy contributed to reduced stress, anxiety, and pain, as well as increased happiness, sleep quality, and emotional well-being (BORGES et al., 2024).

Data from SISAB (Primary Care Information System) indicate a steady increase in the documentation of ICT circles and growing engagement by municipalities. ICT has also been adopted as a humanitarian tool in international conflict mediation and refugee support settings, demonstrating its cultural adaptability and scalability.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, ICT stood out as an innovative and effective response to socioemotional challenges, with wide territorial coverage across Brazil. Between 2017 and 2024, more than 37,000 ICT circles were officially recorded in SUS information systems, involving nearly half a million participations in 27.4% of Brazilian municipalities. These figures are likely underestimated due to underreporting and current limitations in recording collective and community-based practices in national health data systems.

";"Recommendations:

Expand ICT integration into mental health and continuing education policies.

Promote training of community therapists and institutional support for therapy circles.

Recognize ICT as a strategy for building a culture of peace and strengthening social participation.

Challenges:

Ensure financial sustainability for ongoing implementation.

Overcome resistance from biomedical models within health systems.

Address digital exclusion by improving internet access and digital literacy to expand online circle accessibility.";"Integrative Community Therapy; mental health; Unified Health System; Disasters; "

This policy aims to expand healthcare approaches within SUS, fostering integrality and humanized care (Brazil, 2015).

Their origins date back to the 1970s, during the period of military dictatorship, when the dominant biomedical and welfare-centered model began to be questioned and holistic care approaches were debated at the 8th National Health Conference in 1986. It took 20 years for the national policy to be formally instituted, and since then, the 29 practices currently regulated have gradually been recognized by SUS (Silva et al., 2023).
In the state of Acre, located in the Brazilian Legal Amazon, cultural diversity, the presence of traditional communities, limited access to health services—common in the North compared to other regions—and the lack of academic and scientific engagement with MTCIM at UFAC made the implementation of the League particularly relevant.
Within this context, the Academic League of Traditional, Complementary, and Integrative Medicines was founded in 2023 at the Federal University of Acre (UFAC) through a pioneering extension project initiated by students in the Public Health program. The initiative aimed to train students in health-related programs in integrative approaches and to promote community outreach activities.
";"Due to the scarcity of content related to MTCIM in the curricula of undergraduate health programs, which limits professional readiness to work with these practices, and the resistance of some professionals and health managers to incorporating them—often due to lack of knowledge or persistent bias, as noted by Barros et al. (2020)—proposing integrative and complementary care strategies was particularly challenging.
Despite the region’s rich repository of traditional knowledge, healthcare practices related to MTCIM continue to occur in a fragmented and unsystematic manner, often operating on the margins of the public health system.
";"Over the League’s two years of existence, theoretical and practical introductory training sessions were conducted in 8-hour and 20-hour formats, focusing on the following techniques:
•	Auriculotherapy (targeting protocols for anxiety and depression),
•	Reflexology (used for relaxation and pain relief),
•	Cupping therapy (centered on treating anxiety, depression, and stress), and
•	Yoga (focused on conscious breathing exercises).
In total, 21 students were trained in auriculotherapy, 20 in reflexology and cupping therapy, and 14 in yoga.
Care services were provided at the Teaching Clinic of the Center for Health and Sports Sciences (CCSD) at UFAC. During its first operational month, the clinic functioned three days a week, with rotating teams, and served a total of 142 individuals.
In addition, the League carried out outreach activities at the State Institute for Socio-Educational Measures (Instituto de Medidas Socioeducativas do Estado do Acre – ISE) and the Municipal Autism Support Center (Centro de Atendimento ao Autista – CAA), reaching 15 and 25 individuals, respectively. The beneficiaries included students, outsourced workers, adolescents under protective custody, healthcare professionals, and SUS users.

Beyond institutional partnerships, the activities of the Academic League also led to the establishment of a similar initiative in Cruzeiro do Sul, located in the Juruá region of Acre. Operating through UFAC’s Floresta Campus, this new League has continued offering care in hospitals, emergency care units (UPAs), and primary health care units (UBSs) following the initial training phase.
";"Despite the progress achieved so far, the following recommendations are made:
•	Include MTCIM content in the national curricular guidelines of undergraduate health programs to ensure adequate professional training;
•	Strengthen partnerships among universities, healthcare services, and communities to promote the integration of these practices into SUS;
•	Encourage research focused on evaluating the effectiveness and efficacy of MTCIM, thereby contributing to the production of scientific evidence that supports and validates these approaches within public health policy.

These practices serve as complementary resources to conventional mental health treatments, contributing to the reduction of stress, anxiety, depression, and related symptoms.
In Brazil, Ordinance GM/MS No. 971, dated May 3, 2006, established the National Policy on Integrative and Complementary Practices (PNPIC – Política Nacional de Práticas Integrativas e Complementares). This policy aims to broaden healthcare approaches within the Unified Health System (SUS – Sistema Único de Saúde), promoting integrality and humanization in healthcare services (Brazil, 2015).
The Health and Well-Being Project emerged in response to the growing demands and pressures faced by healthcare professionals in Brazil. Its primary objective is to train Family Health Strategy teams and multiprofessional teams in promoting mental health through MTCIM, enhancing the role of health professionals as transformative agents in their communities.
The project was developed through a partnership between the Brazilian Ministry of Health, the Ageu Magalhães Research Institute (IAM), and the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation of Pernambuco (Fiocruz/PE), and implemented in the state of Acre by the State Health Department through the Center for Integrative Practices and the Maria Moreira da Rocha Technical School of Health.
Designed for municipalities with fewer than 70,000 inhabitants, the project was carried out in the following municipalities: Acrelândia, Assis Brasil, Bujari, Brasiléia, Capixaba, Cruzeiro do Sul, Epitaciolândia, Feijó, Jordão, Mâncio Lima, Manoel Urbano, Marechal Thaumaturgo, Plácido de Castro, Porto Acre, Porto Walter, Rio Branco, Rodrigues Alves, Santa Rosa, Sena Madureira, Senador Guiomard, Tarauacá, and Xapuri. It involved the collaboration of 10 local tutors, 1 territory coordinator, 1 pedagogical coordinator, and the MTCIM technical reference from the State Health Department.
";"Using a problem-based methodology and the Maguerez Arch, participants were encouraged to observe their territories and identify occurrences that could be addressed through intervention, considering the local context and realities. The Maguerez Arch is a pedagogical tool designed to foster critical thinking and learning through problem analysis and solution development. It consists of five stages: Observation of Reality, Identification of Key Points, Theorization, Hypothesis Formulation, and Application to Reality.
Students were guided to design an intervention project targeting a specific population and employing an integrative practice suitable for addressing the identified issue.
";"A total of 154 professionals from Family Health teams and multiprofessional teams were trained. The professional categories included nurses, community health agents, psychologists, physiotherapists, and physical education professionals.
Following the diagnostic and planning stages, 43 intervention projects were developed in the state of Acre, all employing MTCIM techniques, such as massage and self-massage, meditation, auriculotherapy, music therapy, dance, body practices, art therapy, and aromatherapy.
The practices were applied to a variety of groups, including mothers of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), elderly individuals, women's groups, and the health teams themselves. Examples of presented projects include:
•	PRO-MEDITAR: Integrative and Complementary Meditation Practice for Promoting Mental Health in Primary Care in Acrelândia;
•	Balance and Well-being: Integrative practices for the mental health of older adults;
•	Healing Encounters: Community therapy for the elderly;
•	The Sound I Do Not Hear: Music therapy as a tool for self-recovery;
•	SerenaMENTE: Promoting a serene and peaceful mind;
•	Youth and Adolescents Facing Drug Abuse and Anxiety: Use of music therapy and collective activities.
One of the main challenges faced during the implementation of the project involved municipalities with difficult access, such as Santa Rosa, Jordão, Marechal Thaumaturgo, and Porto Walter. In these locations, training was conducted entirely online due to geographical constraints, as access is only possible by air (single-engine aircraft). Despite these challenges, all training activities were successfully completed.
Before the implementation of the Health and Well-Being Project, MTCIM practices were reported in only 8 municipalities in the state of Acre. After the project, this number increased to 21 municipalities—reaching 90% of the state's territory.
Health professionals who participated expressed interest in further specialized training to support more comprehensive care delivery. According to social worker Gleiciane Cardoso, from the municipality of Porto Acre, the practices implemented in the interventions promoted dignity and restored participants’ self-esteem.
";"The Health and Well-Being Project presented new possibilities for care and self-care to Family Health Strategy teams and multiprofessional teams, introducing MTCIM as empowering tools for delivering humane and welcoming mental health care. These practices were applied both in preventive care and in the treatment of individuals already affected by mental health conditions.
MTCIM techniques can be incorporated into routine services, strengthening and enhancing the group-based activities already carried out by healthcare teams.
The qualification of primary healthcare professionals in MTCIM techniques emerged as a strong demand during the project’s implementation, signaling the need for continued investment in this area. Professionals themselves identified interest in training for group-appropriate methods such as circular dance, integrative community therapy, auriculotherapy, aromatherapy, and Chinese medicine-based body practices.
This demand has been formally submitted to the State Health Department and is set to be prioritized as part of the continuing education strategy for healthcare professionals in 2026.

In the area of ??health, the municipality has two family health teams (ESF), which share the same physical space, and has 47 employees. ESF coverage in the territory is 100%.With the increase in life expectancy and the aging of the population, considering that the life expectancy of women in Brazil is 79.4 years, it is expected that a large part of the female population will spend approximately one third of their lives post-menopause. Menopause is an inevitable and significant period in women's lives, in which there is a reduction in hormone production, which leads to a series of consequences for the body. It is characterized by the natural cessation of menstruation due to decreased ovarian function, in which physical changes are experienced. On the other hand, urogenital aging represents a common process in the post-menopausal period, with possible changes in vaginal dryness, irritation, sensitivity and pain during sexual intercourse, as well as urinary incontinence, decreased genital vascularization, loss of sensitivity, hot flashes and recurrent lower urinary tract infections. The negative impact on women's quality of life becomes evident, associated not only with the metabolic aspect, but also with the social aspect (SHIRAZ et al., 2021).;Providing a better quality of life during this phase of menopause complementary and integrative treatments , mainly through the use of medicinal teas such as white mulberry leaf and flaxseed, as they contain large amounts of phytoestrogens, which are molecules that have the effect of the estrogen hormone in the body and help to alleviate the symptoms of menopause, being used as a way to alleviate the symptoms caused by hormonal reduction. In this context, several long-term therapies are implemented in the treatment of menopause symptoms, aiming to alleviate symptoms and mitigate urogenital aging. Some of these complementary therapies include the use of minerals and vitamins, acupuncture, physical exercise and dietary changes. In addition, herbal medicines have been used on a large scale to reduce the symptoms of menopause (OZCAN et al., 2019). Sampling of all patients aged 45 and over who had some type of medical or nursing consultation at the Salto Veloso health unit. Six stages were followed to conduct the study: choosing the topic and formatting the research question, applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, identifying the age group, as well as the year selected to begin the introduction of complementary e and integrative treatmento reduce hormone replacement therapy, categorizing the selected studies, discussing the results and presenting the review or synthesis of knowledge. The first stage consisted of defining the theme in order to answer the guiding question of the research: “What are the phytotherapies and complementary integrative treatments  used and their effectiveness in the adjuvant treatment of menopause symptoms?” The second stage consisted of searching for the availability of articles on the topic in the scientific literature. In the third and fourth stages, the inclusion criteria were: patients over 45 years of age, correlating patients seen by the unit's nurses with the number of patients referred and seen by the Gynecologist for HRT, between 2023 and 2024. Then, a comparative evaluation of these data and their results was carried out.;"However, it was determined that more than half of the women evaluated did not have adequate information about the menopause process. In 2022, it was performed by nurses with CIAP X11 Signs/symptoms of menopause/climacteric 21 patients
In 2022, it was performed by a gynecologist with ICD N951 State of menopause and female climacteric 32 patients
In 2023, it was performed by nurses with CIAP X11 Signs/symptoms of menopause/climacteric 31 patients
In 2023, it was performed by a gynecologist with ICD N951 State of menopause and female climacteric 28 patients
In 2024, it was performed by nurses with CIAP X11 Signs/symptoms of menopause/climacteric 44 patients
In 2024, it was performed by a gynecologist with ICD N951 State of menopause and female climacteric 25 patients
The above data were taken from the municipal e-sus system. In this way, we can observe the increasing number of consultations with nursing professionals, as well as the decrease in the number of consultations with gynecologists. This is the consequence of the effects of complementary and integrative treatment as fewer patients were referred for treatment of menopause. It is worth remembering that nurses provide complementary and integrative treatment in partnership with the Pastoral da Saúde.";"Herbal remedies are very effective and have few side effects when compared to HRT.However, more studies and clinical trials are needed to make these medicinal herbs such as white mulberry tea, sage, green tea, ginger and soy isoflavone a complementary  treatment for the treatment of symptoms associated with menopause in the near future. Based on the comprehensive review on the use of herbal medicine in the treatment of menopause, it is clear that medicinal plants are promising and effective for women seeking to alleviate symptoms such as hot flashes, depression and genitourinary symptoms.(SciELO Brazil-2021).Herbs such as black cohosh, turmeric, Hypericum perforatum, among others, have demonstrated significant benefits with fewer side effects when compared to conventional hormone therapies. However, current research still lacks robust studies that fully validate their efficacy and long-term safety, highlighting the need for more well-controlled clinical trials and standardization in cultivation and extraction methods. Therefore, while phytotherapy represents a promising therapeutic option, it is crucial to continue advancing the understanding of its mechanisms of action and clinical impacts to better guide its clinical use and enhance its benefits in improving the quality of life of women in menopause.

Metabolic syndrome is a global health concern linked to rising rates of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, obesity, and inflammatory conditions. Traditional management strategies often lack personalization, leaving patients disengaged and confused. Recognizing this gap, our academic healthcare system launched a 4-week virtual Metabolic Health Program to provide early intervention, empower behavior change, and integrate modern technology with holistic principles.

Objectives
The goal was to implement a scalable, cost-effective, and patient-centered metabolic health program using Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) and guided lifestyle interventions. The program aimed to:

Improve metabolic awareness through CGM data

Promote personalized behavior change

Integrate Eastern and Western strategies to support long-term health

Chronological Flow
The program was delivered virtually over four weeks to cohorts of 20–30 patients per group. Each group met weekly for 60-minute Zoom sessions, facilitated by a physician or trained health coach. Sessions included didactic teaching, CGM data review, group discussion, and personalized recommendations.

Materials & Procedures

Week 1: Participants received CGMs and completed baseline labs (fasting insulin, CMP, HbA1c, lipids, CRP) and InBody scans. The session focused on insulin resistance, glucose metabolism, and CGM use.

Week 2: Participants reviewed their glucose trends, learning how food timing, stress, sleep, and movement affected their levels. Concepts like chrono-nutrition and intermittent fasting were introduced.

Week 3: Focused on lifestyle adjustments—macronutrient balance, fiber, herbs (e.g., turmeric, cinnamon, fenugreek), and individualized exercise plans.

Week 4: Final data review, long-term planning, sleep hygiene, and stress management strategies were emphasized. Participants received a personalized health roadmap.

Participants
Patients ranged from those with prediabetes and insulin resistance to those seeking weight loss, hormone balance, and improved energy. Referrals came from physicians (55%), online platforms (16%), family/friends (13%), and dietitians (11%). All participants were adults with basic digital literacy and interest in metabolic health.

Theoretical Framework
The program was informed by integrative medicine principles, using both clinical science (glucose metabolism, behavioral nutrition) and Eastern frameworks (circadian rhythm, mindful eating, Ayurvedic digestive concepts).";"Key Challenges
Metabolic syndrome affects over a third of U.S. adults and is rising globally. It contributes to major chronic diseases and imposes a significant economic burden. Current clinical approaches often treat symptoms rather than root causes. They rely heavily on weight loss and medication, lacking real-time feedback and personalization.

Impact of Challenges
Patients frequently feel overwhelmed by conflicting advice, unsure which foods or habits are contributing to symptoms like fatigue, belly fat, and poor sleep. Traditional interventions miss the opportunity to engage patients early—before blood glucose, cholesterol, or body composition reach critical thresholds.

Resource Limitations
Many clinics lack the infrastructure or staffing to offer individualized nutrition or lifestyle coaching. Our program was designed to overcome this by using a virtual group model that is both efficient and high-touch, leveraging technology for real-time biofeedback.";"Participant Engagement and Satisfaction
Survey results from 50 participants showed:

100% would recommend the program

82% found the CGM and app “somewhat” or “extremely” easy to use

88% planned to use CGM again

60% preferred extending the course to 6 weeks

62% felt 60-minute sessions were adequate, while others wanted more time

Behavior Change and Insights
Open-ended responses revealed key takeaways:

Understanding personal glucose responses to different foods

Learning how food order (fiber ? protein/fat ? carbs) reduces glucose spikes

Importance of meal timing, early dinners, and reduced snacking

Impact of sleep, stress, and exercise on glucose

Realizing healthy foods sometimes spike glucose, and some indulgences don’t

Sample participant quote:

“This was life-changing. I learned that I can change patterns in my health through routine and discipline.”

Knowledge Acquisition
Participants were empowered to self-experiment and interpret their CGM trends. Eastern teachings like “breakfast as the biggest meal” or eating with the sun were well received and validated by glucose data. Participants reported increased confidence in making informed food and lifestyle choices.

Program Delivery & Scalability
The virtual group format proved effective and sustainable. A single physician or coach could guide up to 30 patients at once, combining education, real-time data interpretation, and peer support. Minimal infrastructure was needed beyond CGMs and Zoom access.

Evidence & Analysis
Participant feedback showed improvement in:

Awareness of metabolic triggers

Reduction in glucose variability

Increased physical activity and mindful eating

Greater adherence to sleep and meal routines

Empowerment and health confidence

As one participant noted:

“I always thought I had to avoid carbs completely. Now I know how to enjoy them the right way for my body.”";"Objectives Assessment
All objectives were met: patients gained metabolic literacy, adopted personalized strategies, and integrated both scientific and holistic tools for long-term health.

Practical Recommendations

Use CGM beyond diabetes: Apply CGMs for early detection and personalized coaching in metabolic prevention

Embrace virtual group formats: High impact, low cost, and scalable

Blend Eastern and Western insights: Helps patients connect with ancient wisdom validated by modern data

Encourage self-experimentation: Foster agency, curiosity, and long-term change

Future Directions
Extend the program to 5–6 weeks as requested by 60% of participants. Offer advanced tracks, follow-up support groups, and alumni forums. Integrate a nutritionist for individualized care. Consider recordings with HIPAA-compliant consent to aid retention and review. Include toolkits, recipes, and community platforms for continued engagement.

Contribution to the Field
This experience demonstrates that data-driven, personalized, and integrative programs are not only feasible but highly effective in managing early-stage metabolic dysfunction. It offers a model for academic institutions and health systems to scale proactive, patient-centered care.";"metabolic syndrome; educational group; BLOOD GLUCOSE; Culturally Appropriate Technology; Patient Satisfaction"

In line with this healthcare approach, the Extension Project “Less Pain More Health” was established in response to the demand from a Family Health Clinic in Niterói, Rio de Janeiro. This Project was developed in partnership with the Medical Internship Supervision of Fluminense Federal University (UFF) and Federal State Health Foundation of Niterói (FeSaúde).
The main objective of the Project was to treat patients suffering from chronic pain of various origins using a combined methodology of monthly therapeutic-educational group sessions and weekly acupuncture treatments.
The experience with the Extension Project has shown a reduction in pain complaints, decreased reliance on pain medications, relief from negative emotions associated with chronic pain and improvements in patients’ personal, family and work lives, ultimately enhancing their overall quality of life.
";"This proposal aligns with the 2006 National Policy on Integrative and Complementary Practices (Política Nacional de Práticas Integrativas e Complementares), which prioritizes integrative practices in primary care under the current Family Health Strategy model (Estratégia Saúde da Família) (BRASIL, 2006).
The following key considerations were taken into account for the proposal’s certification:
1.	Patient demand: The presence of chronic pain patients under the care of primary care/family health professionals;
2.	Referral delays: Slow referral processes for patients requiring secondary care;
3.	Trained professionals: Availability of technically qualified staff for patient education and chronic pain management at the primary/family health unit;
4.	Management support: Backing from the management of the family health unit where the initiative will take place;
5.	Supervised training: Oversight of medical interns from the Federal Fluminense University’s (Universidade Federal Fluminense) Faculty of Medicine by an instructor qualified to conduct the health intervention;
6.	Educational groups: Sessions for eligible patients, with participation from trainees;
7.	Combined approach: An educational component paired with individualized acupuncture treatment sessions for eligible patients.
";"During the 18-month duration of the Extension Project ""Less Pain More Health"" , 36 patients participated regularly in the monthly group meetings, with the majority being female and over 60 years old.
The first three sessions focused on:
1.	Patient's reception;
2.	Sharing individual stories of physical and non-physical pain;
3.	Reports of negative emotions associated with chronic pain, predominantly sadness, anger, or resentment;
4.	Accounts of functional impairment hindering or preventing paid or unpaid work;
5.	Disruption of close emotional and family relationships due to disbelief about the severity of pain;
6.	Links between chronic pain and comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, trauma, and neoplasms;
7.	Associations between chronic pain and prescription drug misuse or self-medication;
8.	Connections between chronic pain and polypharmacy (analgesics, anti-inflammatories, anticonvulsants, and anxiolytics/antidepressants);
9.	Ties between chronic pain and increased alcohol consumption;
10.	Relationships between chronic pain and reduced self-care (e.g., sedentary behavior, unhealthy diet, and poor posture).
Subsequent sessions addressed pain management through:
1.	Postural guidance and video-led exercises by the physiotherapist;
2.	Training in active listening, empathy, and validation of each other’s chronic pain experiences—led by the occupational therapist and psychologist;
3.	Encouraging open communication about emotions within families, including those tied to chronic pain—facilitated by all team members;
4.	Promoting dialogue with the Family Health Team to improve pain-related care—led by the psychologist;
5.	Guidance on adherence to prescribed chronic pain medications—provided by the family physician;
6.	Empowerment through reframing chronic pain narratives into learning experiences about health and life—guided by the supervisor and medical interns.
The final three sessions revealed:
1.	Reports of significant reductions in chronic pain levels;
2.	Improved daily functionality, with some patients resuming paid work;
3.	Enhanced self-esteem, self-confidence, self-care, and clearer communication about pain-related and unrelated emotions in personal/family settings;
4.	Observable behaviors of joy and satisfaction during group meetings.
Acupuncture:
All 32 users/patients received weekly individualized acupuncture sessions, totaling at least 10 sessions. Of these, 20 patients continued treatment for over six months (24+ sessions). Key results included:
1.	Patients completing ?10 sessions reported pain reduction from ?8 to ?3 on the visual analog scale (VAS);
2.	Some in this group noted improved sleep, daytime relaxation, and reduced sadness/anger linked to pain;
3.	Even those with <10 sessions reported better mood and positive feedback from relatives;
4.	Patients with ?10 sessions—especially those completing 24+—demonstrated:
o	Improved functionality and return to previously pain-restricted activities;
o	Reduced anxiety, significant medication/alcohol reduction, and better control of non-pain-related diagnoses;
o	Enhanced self-esteem, self-confidence, and self-care, as noted by patients and families.
";"The Extension Project “Less Pain, More Health” was initiated in the Teixeira de Freitas Family Health Unit in Niterói's Fonseca neighborhood, in collaboration with medical internship supervision. It emerged in response to chronic pain patients experiencing significantly compromised quality of life despite conventional medical treatment.
The project's combined approach - integrating monthly therapeutic educational groups with weekly individualized acupuncture sessions - demonstrated significant advances in:
1.	Alleviating chronic pain conditions
2.	Improving non-pain related comorbidities
3.	Reducing excessive medication use (including complete discontinuation in some cases)
4.	Addressing negative emotions associated with pain and its impact on personal, family, and work life
5.	Enhancing overall quality of life
Conclusion
The Extension Project ""Less Pain More Health"" represents a successful methodological approach achieving comprehensive primary care objectives. It serves as:
•	A cornerstone of family healthcare practice
•	An intervention addressing treatment, prevention, and health promotion simultaneously
•	A means of strengthening patient-health unit relationships
This model effectively demonstrates the potential of integrative approaches in primary care settings.

This experience was implemented at private medical practices.;One male patient was monitored from March 2019 to September 2020, and two female patients have been under follow-up since November 2024 to the present. The 2019-2020 patient initially received injectable Viscum album (Malus 1 mg) via subcutaneous injection, then transitioned to topical hydrogel application at the affected area. Patients were instructed to apply the hydrogel on the face affected area after bathing at night, prior to any other products. Periodic photographs were taken and submitted without editing.

Such an approach could improve patient adherence due to its lower cost, ease of application, and better tolerability compared to injectable forms, ultimately enhancing treatment compliance.
Recommendations: 
1-	Conduct randomized controlled clinical trials with larger sample sizes to validate the preliminary outcomes observed;
2-	Encourage integration regarding the use of Viscum album hydrogel into complementary and conventional dermatological care approaches;
3-	Enhance patient education to improve adherence to non-invasive topical treatments.
Challenges: 
1-	Lack of a control or placebo group, which limits the ability to distinguish treatment effect from spontaneous improvement or placebo response;
2-	Small sample size and individual variability in clinical presentation of rosacea limit the clinical evidence;

Its primary aim is to bridge theoretical knowledge with practical application, thereby fostering authentic learning while enhancing students’ transferrable skills and employability outcomes.  WIL involves three key stakeholders: the student, the university and the industry sector in which the student will eventually work.

Torrens University Australia (TUA) through its founding college, the Southern School of Natural Therapies (SSNT), has been a pioneer in naturopathic education, delivering clinical qualifications continuously for over 60 years.  Within this context, WIL has traditionally been embedded in the final years of the program where students undertake pre-clinic observations and supervised placements as practitioners in the university’s purpose-built, student-led clinic ""The Practice"",  

While this approach has proven successful, in 2018, as part of a comprehensive course review, the university sought to develop a more immersive WIL program to enhance:
-	Industry specific knowledge 
-	Practice and dispensary management skills
-	Employability skills
-	Scaffolded learning

The COVID-19 pandemic prompted a further evolution and rapid adaptation of the traditional in-person WIL model. In response, the university implemented several initiatives including; a virtual industry speaker series and industry ‘trade show’, telehealth consultations for the clinic, online clinic observations, synchronous online workshops and practical intensives, to maintain continuity of experiential learning. Following the easing of pandemic restrictions, the WIL program expanded through support from the Australian Government’s New Colombo Plan, enabling international placements and cross-cultural learning experiences.

The enhanced WIL program fosters broader graduate attributes, including:
-	social justice 
-	global citizenship
-	intercultural competence

The design and implementation of the revised WIL model are underpinned by Kolb’s Experiential Learning Theory, which conceptualises learning as a cyclical process involving concrete experience, reflective observation, abstract conceptualization, and active experimentation. This model supports the integration of hands-on clinical practice with reflective and theoretical learning, aligning with the program’s goal of producing work-ready graduates equipped for the complexities of contemporary naturopathic practice.";"In the pre-clinic WIL program students were placed in the university’s dedicated clinic to engage in entry-level tasks.  However, the program faced facility-related challenges due to a significant increase in enrolments.  Additionally, the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic required a rapid transition from on-campus to virtual delivery. These factors required the academic team to innovate and diversify the WIL experience.
 
The current hybrid WIL model incorporates a range of learning activities: 

•	virtual industry speaker series 
•	appointment as client at the university clinic 
•	workshops on dispensary and administration skills 
•	observation placements with external practitioners
•	virtual practice observations 
•	simulated clinic with mock clients
•	shadowing placements at the university clinic
•	student practitioner clinic placements 
•	international WIL experience to visit health facilities in Nepal

WIL adaptations were particularly well received by industry stakeholders who valued the direct connection with students. An industry consultant role manages stakeholder relationships and mitigates any potential conflicts of interest. This role proved essential to reduce the administrative burden on academics and maintain equitable engagement with external partners as program numbers continue to grow.

Despite overall positive engagement, some students expressed resistance to independently source external observation placements. To address this, the university implemented an online placement search tool, ‘Careers Connect’, populated with opportunities procured by the industry team who vet placement opportunities, manage legal agreements, and support students throughout the process. More recently, an online, interactive WIL Toolkit was created to equip students with essential skills and confidence for placement success. The toolkit includes interactive modules on resume and cover letter writing, employer expectations, and industry standards.";"An informal quality assurance questionnaire of the hybrid pre-clinical WIL program completed during 2023 and 2024, elicited 123 responses across three campus locations.  The majority of comments were positive and included the following insights:

•	The most valuable learning experiences were in-person workshops, including dispensary and administration activities. Industry guest speakers, appointment at the student clinic and WIL resources were also of value.  
•	Over 80% of students felt confident to implement learning in the future.  
•	Over 90% rated the WIL program as valuable to their professional development.

Students undertaking observation and shadowing placements in year 3 complete a reflective assessment.  Open-ended comments indicate satisfaction with the program, with students expressing confidence in transitioning to the student practitioner role.  Sample reflections include:
-	The clinic (observation) experience was great. 
-	Really prepared me for what I am to be doing when I do my clinic placement 
-	I loved the in-clinic observation period

Of students exiting, 100% felt confident to practice within a clinical setting or find employment within the profession.  Three quarters of them intended to establish private practice.  

Regarding the Nepal WIL program, 103 complementary health students participated between 2022 to 2025.  In the program, students engage with various health and education organisations to expand cultural understanding and foster global perspectives.  Students consistently describe the experience as transformational, inspiring and motivational.  They report increased awareness of equity in access to healthcare, community health problem-solving, and their role as future change-makers.";"This report documents the evolving nature of WIL which has developed from a final clinical component to an immersive inquiry-based experience.  Interpersonal skills, professional attributes and capabilities are scaffolded throughout the program to support employability and practice readiness.  

The program will continue to evolve with a suggested expansion of clinical placement opportunities and live briefs from industry stakeholders.  Incorporating herbal manufacturing training into the pre-clinic WIL program may further strengthen student preparedness for employment and career success.

The initial objectives of the WIL program were modified to include a much more diverse program of activities than originally anticipated.  Feedback indicates WIL experiences are well received and a valuable part of the overall student learning experience.";"work integrated learning; naturopathy; Health Education"

The project involves:

Conducting interviews with individuals who maintain these practices.
Recording recipes and preparation methods through audiovisual and written formats.
Analyzing the medicinal plants and their roles in these formulations.
Highlighting the emotional and cultural impact of these practices on health and well-being.

Abstract

Traditional medicine is a cornerstone of Uruguay’s cultural heritage, with family-based knowledge passed down through generations. This project aims to document, preserve, and disseminate recipes for herbal syrups used to alleviate respiratory conditions like coughs and colds, particularly during winter. These remedies often include plants such as Urtica dioica, Micania glomerata, Salvia officinalis y Cecropia adenopus, valued for their effectiveness and cultural significance.


By interviewing practitioners, the study records authentic recipes and their historical contexts. Methodologies include in-person and remote interviews via video, audio, or text, ensuring diverse participation. This work emphasizes the importance of direct familial transmission and excludes sources like books or internet recipes to maintain authenticity.";"1. Progressive loss of traditional knowledge:
The intergenerational transmission of knowledge about the use of medicinal plants is at risk due to urbanization, medicalization, and the lack of appreciation for natural practices, which threatens the continuity of this cultural heritage.

2. Lack of systematization of traditional knowledge:
Despite their widespread use at the family level, homemade cough syrups made with medicinal plants often lack scientific systematization that allows their recipes, uses, and effects to be recorded, compared, and validated.

3. Poor coordination between folk medicine and public health:
Homemade cough syrups represent an accessible and low-cost primary care resource; however, they are not typically considered by formal health systems, which prevents their use as a complementary tool in respiratory prevention and care.";"Preliminary results: 
It was confirmed that there is a family tradition in Uruguay of preparing homemade cough syrups, as well as various herbal remedies, infusions, decoctions, and macerations. These are used as adjuvants in the treatment of coughs, flu, and colds, resulting in great relief from the symptoms of these respiratory conditions. Interviewees describe their preparation, method of administration, and the resulting well-being or improvement. This popular tradition exists in Uruguayan families, which endures and is sustained over time, from generation to generation, thanks to the successful results obtained that demonstrate its effectiveness through practice. More than 30 interviews were conducted to record these valuable ancestral family experiences in health care in Uruguay. The goal was to preserve these experiences, study the medicinal plants used, and finally, publish the research results so that the recipes generously provided in the interviews would be freely accessible and available. This information will be uploaded to the Uruguayan School of Naturopathy website and will be freely accessible.

Twenty-two medicinal plants used in herbal preparations were recorded and botanically identified for further study. A list was compiled with their scientific nomenclature. It was found that some medicinal plants are present in several recipes, such as Guaco (Mikania glomerata), Loquat (Eriobotrya japonicao), Climbing Sage (Lippia alba), Onion (Allium cepa), and Lemon (Citrus limon). We also found that of the total number of plant species recorded, only a third were native to Uruguay, the majority being exotic. It was also observed that native plants are repeated in several recipes. 

The primary methodology used was a face-to-face interview, in which a series of questions were asked, emphasizing that the shared recipes had to be for family use only and used effectively within the family over time. Recipes were requested to be sent via audio recording via WhatsApp message to facilitate submission and registration. A complementary audiovisual presentation was edited with this material, featuring the voices of some of the interviewees as a representative of this experience report. The audio recordings describe the preparation and administration process, as well as the emotional bond with family as an ever-present intangible ingredient. The loving memory of the recipes, the intention to heal, and the pleasant feeling always present in the stories, as well as the well-being achieved with symptom relief, were confirmed.

An important fact is that the ingredients in most of the recipes are easily and inexpensively accessible and can be prepared with items already present in the home. Even the medicinal plants used in these recipes are present in most family gardens and orchards, often not requiring purchase. The practice of sharing the plants needed for these preparations among friends, neighbors, and family is highlighted, highlighting the beautiful community bond that seeks to share popular healing practices.

More than 40 recipes were obtained and recorded on a spreadsheet as an annex. Another spreadsheet also recorded the information of the interviewees and their geographical origins, highlighting that most of the recipes come from rural areas in different departments of Uruguay. Another complementary material is a spreadsheet on the recorded medicinal plants. Among the recipes, we highlight the preparation of ""Quemadillo"" syrup, which is repeated in several recipes and is prepared with burnt or caramelized sugar to which various medicinal plants are added. The sugar is quickly heated in the caramel for a few seconds, and then water is added, thus decocting for a few minutes until the liquid concentrates. This syrup is taken warm by the spoonful to relieve coughs, and it can also be drunk as a cup before bed. The description of this ""Quemadillo"" syrup is only an example; all recipes are recorded on the registration form, along with their quantities, preparation method, and administration.




";"The outcomes will serve to:

Promote the understanding of ethnobotanical practices.
Encourage integration of these methods within contemporary health frameworks.
Highlight the emotional bonds tied to ancestral health practices.


This initiative bridges tradition and modernity, fostering respect for cultural heritage while addressing contemporary health challenges. The project contributes to the global recognition of Uruguay’s rich medicinal legacy and supports its preservation for future generations.";"phytotherapy; Medicinal plants; Ethnobotany; traditional medicine; Traditional herbal syrups"

It also provides a sense of belonging and emotional resilience, while strengthening social skills. Participating in activities in a marine environment is said to be a catalyst for overcoming trauma and developing autonomy.
This report aims to share the experience of the Ondas Arpoador project, which has been running since January 2022 at Arpoador Beach in Rio de Janeiro. The project's primary focus is on surf therapy and inclusive diving, catering to individuals with various disabilities and psychological conditions, including cerebral palsy, autism, schizophrenia, visual impairment, and a history of substance abuse. Since its inception, the project has served approximately 200 people between the ages of seven and seventy, and has become a benchmark in beach-based therapeutic care, combining contact with nature with the strengthening of emotional bonds and the promotion of comprehensive health.
The adopted methodology prioritises sensitive adaptation to the needs of each participant, respecting individuality without imposing pre-established forms of action. This allows participants to experience the sea as a process of self-knowledge and overcoming barriers. Activities are led by surf instructors, psychotherapists and dedicated volunteers and are divided into three stages: welcoming participants and helping them to adapt to the environment; surfing or diving; and finally, therapeutic listening.";"In general, we observed remarkable improvements in self-confidence, autonomy, self-esteem, socialisation and communication, as reported by participants. Participants also described improved sleep, reduced anxiety and stress, and an increased sense of pleasure and joy. Many participants reported that they had overcome barriers.
Those with autism spectrum disorder showed improvement in emotional regulation and socialisation. Routine predictability and the natural environment act as emotional support elements, reducing sensory overload episodes and promoting calmness. For people with schizophrenia, surfing has proven to be a therapeutic activity that helps them to regain their sense of presence and connection with reality, alleviating negative symptoms such as apathy and isolation. Subjects with a history of substance abuse often report that the adrenaline rush of surfing replaces their craving for substances, providing a healthy source of pleasure. Recidivism is reduced while self-esteem and identity are strengthened with each session. For people with cerebral palsy, the physical benefits are clear: improved posture, stronger muscles, increased mobility and greater stamina. Additionally, the emotional and symbolic aspects of the experience, such as overcoming fear, experiencing pleasure and feeling a sense of equality, emerge as central components of subjective transformation. For people with visual impairments, increased self-esteem, a sense of belonging, autonomy, body awareness, and improved orientation and mobility are observed.";;"The project is conducted exclusively with its own funding and is not tied to any institutions. Consequently, it has limited resources. This poses a significant challenge to its maintenance and continuity, given that the majority of participants lack the socioeconomic means to pay for the service. Scarce resources make it unfeasible to expand to a larger number of participants, despite the deep social mobilisation based on empathy and acceptance.
The Ondas Arpoador project has proven to be a powerful tool for care and inclusion, offering an effective and sensitive alternative to conventional therapeutic practices. By combining surf therapy with psychotherapeutic listening and community interaction, the initiative reimagines approaches to treating psychological distress and physical limitations, reframing the body and the sea as domains of strength and dignity. Direct involvement with participants, attentive monitoring by professionals and the commitment of volunteers reveal the power of experiences based on affection and presence. In this context, the sea ceases to be merely a landscape and becomes a welcoming, transformative space.";"Surf Therapy; Integrative Practices; people with disabilities"

São Luiz's UBSs;"Introduction : Mental health is intrinsically linked to an individual's social, cultural, and economic context. Factors like work overload, exposure to distressing situations, and pressure for results can compromise the mental health of healthcare professionals. Therefore, this research aims to investigate the impact of an innovative initiative, ""Caring for the Caregiver,"" on promoting the well-being and mental health of employees in Basic Health Units (UBSs). This initiative utilizes Integrative and Complementary Practices (ICPs) to offer a space for support and care to professionals, thereby strengthening the team and, consequently, the quality of care provided to the population. 

Objective: The objective was to promote the well-being and mental health of staff members before or after their assessment for accreditation by ONA (National Accreditation Organization), a non-governmental entity that certifies the quality of healthcare services in Brazil. The ""Caring for the Caregiver"" initiative used Integrative and Complementary Health Practices (ICPs) to provide a space for support and care to professionals, aiming to strengthen the team and improve the quality of care and support.  ";"Methodology : The ""Caring for the Caregiver"" initiative took place on March 21, 2024, May 15, 2024, May 16, 2024, June 6, 2024, June 14, 2024, May 13, 2025, and May 19, 2025, across seven Basic Health Units (UBSs) in Jardim São Luiz. Participants included staff members (doctors, nurses, nursing technicians, community health agents, and others, aged between 18 and 60) who were participating or would participate in the ONA accreditation process.

The practices offered included meditation, auriculotherapy, aromatherapy, self-massage, reflexology, conversation circles, and breathing techniques. These were conducted at various times to accommodate the largest possible number of employees. At the end of the activities, a questionnaire was administered via Google Forms to evaluate participant satisfaction, addressing aspects such as well-being, stress reduction, and perceived usefulness of the practices performed.";"Results
This analysis was based on data collected from 93 participants through online questionnaires. The study aimed to investigate the acceptance, impact, and availability of Integrative and Complementary Practices (ICPs) in workplaces. The results offer a detailed perspective on the relevance of these interventions for professionals' health and well-being.

Adoption and Satisfaction Levels with ICPs
A strong preference and high satisfaction rate for the incorporation of ICPs were observed among participants. Meditation and breathing techniques emerged as the most sought-after modalities, accounting for 74.2% of participation. This substantial percentage indicates significant interest and acceptance of these approaches, solidifying their position as preferred options among the evaluated professionals. To a lesser extent, reflexology and auriculotherapy were also accessed, both with 12.9% participation.

The overall perception of satisfaction regarding the implemented interventions was notably high. On a scale of 1 (unsatisfactory) to 5 (excellent) for the proposed actions, the average rating attributed by employees reached 4.87. This value, very close to the theoretical maximum, corroborates the effectiveness and positive impact of ICPs on participants' experiences.

Physiological and Psychological Responses Post-Intervention
The sensations reported by participants after engaging in ICPs demonstrated consistent positive outcomes, though with variations depending on the modality:

For auriculotherapy, 100% of participants reported feeling ""Very relaxed with physical and mental well-being,"" highlighting the potent anxiolytic and holistic effect of this practice.
For meditation, the majority of individuals (81.2%) experienced a state of ""Very relaxed,"" while 17.4% reported feeling ""Calmer and with reduced stress""; a small fraction (1.4%) indicated mixed sensations.
Regarding reflexology, the perceived benefits were more heterogeneous: 41.7% of participants reported stress reduction, 33.3% achieved a state of deep relaxation, and 16.7% indicated increased physical disposition. Mixed sensations were cited by 8.3% of participants.
These findings not only underscore the popularity of meditation and breathing techniques but also emphasize the intrinsic ability of ICPs in general to induce states of well-being, relaxation, and stress mitigation, significantly contributing to the improvement of individuals' quality of life.

Prevalence and Characterization of ICP Initiatives in the Workplace
The investigation into the existence of groups, spaces, or initiatives supporting holistic health with a focus on ICPs in workplaces revealed a diverse landscape, predominantly characterized by informal actions.

Specifically, 55.38% of respondents indicated the presence of informal or ad-hoc initiatives aimed at professional well-being, reflecting spontaneous engagement among teams in promoting health, even without a predefined formal structure. In contrast, 21.54% of participants reported the existence of formal and well-structured initiatives for this purpose, suggesting that these units have already integrated ICPs into their institutional well-being policies. However, 15.38% of respondents stated the absence of specific groups or spaces dedicated to this purpose in their units, indicating a gap in the provision of structured ICPs. Additionally, 7.69% of participants expressed unfamiliarity with the existence of any such initiatives in their respective units, which could point to either the actual absence of such programs or deficiencies in internal communication and dissemination of available resources.

Implications and Relevance in the Context of Occupational Health
The analyzed activities contributed to strengthening interpersonal bonds and fostering a healthier and more welcoming work environment. The relevance of these results is amplified when considering that contemporary studies on the health of professionals, particularly in the healthcare field, consistently point to a high prevalence of conditions such as emotional exhaustion, chronic stress, and Burnout Syndrome. The implementation and continuous promotion of ICPs can, therefore, represent effective strategies to mitigate such challenges, promoting greater resilience and psychophysical well-being among professionals. ";"Conclusion
The ""Caring for the Caregiver"" experience highlights the importance of investing in the well-being of healthcare professionals, as healthy employees are capable of providing higher quality care to the population. Integrative and Complementary Practices (ICPs) proved to be an effective tool for promoting the mental health and well-being of professionals, contributing to an improved quality of life at work and the optimization of healthcare services.

It is recommended to expand and continue these health-promoting initiatives for professionals, offering regular activities and establishing support groups. Furthermore, it is crucial that healthcare institutions invest in training and empowering professionals so they can identify and address the mental health needs of their colleagues.

In the international scenario, these practices are known as Traditional, Complementary and Integrative Medicine (TCIM). They were included in the National Policy for Integrative and Complementary Practices (PNPIC), instituted in 2006, through Ministerial Order No. 849 of March 27, 2017. Also known as Peoples' Dance, Circular Dances are performed in a circle, with music that supports body movements led by the facilitator. During this practice, rhythm, body expression and awareness, motor coordination and memory are worked, providing an environment for socializing, exchanging knowledge and experiences, integration, cooperation and respect for differences. Recognizing its benefits for the integral health of the population, this practice was incorporated into the PICS UFF Extension Project, created in 2019 at the Faculty of Pharmacy of the Fluminense Federal University (UFF, located in Niteroi, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil). The project is dedicated to disseminating scientific evidence about the effectiveness of PICS/TCIM through posts in accessible language, which summarize scientific articles that have already been published. These posts are shared on the blog (PAULINO et al., 2019) and on the project's social networks: Instagram (@uffpics) and Facebook (PICS UFF), with Instagram currently being the most used platform. In addition to producing content, the project participates in academic and scientific events, both internal and external to UFF, as well as initiatives carried out by partner institutions, such as the Niteroi Health Department. 
";"The experiences related to this report make it possible to solve two important issues related to Traditional, Complementary and Integrative Medicines (TCIM): (1) access to scientific evidence in this area, promoting scientific dissemination and also health education; and (2) access to PICS/TCIM experiences in different environments, both academic and public places that are easily accessible to the local population.
";"In these spaces, the project is presented and offers some PICS/TCIM, including experiences in Circular Dances. During the Covid-19 pandemic, the activities were maintained remotely, through transmissions via Instagram, YouTube, Google Meet and Zoom, ensuring the continuity of the experiences even in a challenging context. In view of the fruitful production and satisfactory feedback from the experiences carried out by PICS UFF, this practice was integrated into the research and extension project “Integrative and Complementary Health Practices in the municipality of Niterói: health promotion and awareness of self-care”, which aims to expand the offer of actions and care in PICS/TCIM to Niteroi’s population. This project was approved in 2020 by the call for proposals of the Applied Project Development Program (PDPA) - a partnership between the Niteroi City Hall, the Euclides da Cunha Foundation and the university (UFF). The work was expanded in 2024 with the Circular Dances Workshop, with weekly meetings, by the project “Social Work with Elderly People: Participatory Processes in the Construction of Citizenship”, which offers workshops, cultural and leisure activities to elderly people, and is held at the university's Advanced Space, linked to the School of Social Work at the Fluminense Federal University. This practice was also part of research projects conducted by two post-doctoral fellows, involving undergraduate students from the Faculty of Pharmacy and the School of Nursing at UFF. As a result, a scientific article (PAULINO et al., 2025a) and an e-book (BARBOSA et al., 2021) were produced, in which the practice of Circular Dances was contemplated, as well as presentations of papers at congresses (PAULINO et al., 2024a; PAULINO et al., 2024b), including expanded abstracts (PAULINO et al., 2025b), oral presentations, poster presentations and dance practices. Other contributions include the training of public health workers in Niteroi (through the PDPA Project), the production of videos and educational materials on EduCapes (PAULINO et al., 2024c; PAULINO et al., 2024d), as well as teaching classes on Introduction to Integrative and Complementary Health Practices and Introduction to Natural Health Therapies, respectively, at the Faculty of Pharmacy and the School of Nursing at UFF. Experiences and workshops with Circular Dances were held in internal and external programs at UFF, including: Student Welcome and UFF's Academic Agenda, PICS Events (organized by NEPIC - Center for Studies in Integrative and Complementary Practices/UFF), event celebrating 15 years of the MPEA (Professional Master's Degree in Nursing Care/UFF), Yellow September Seminar/UFF, UFF in the Squares, Server's Week and National Health Day (promoted by the Health Promotion and Surveillance Division, linked to UFF's Coordination of Integral Health Care and Quality of Life). Some actions that included the practice of Circular Dances were carried out in partnership with the PICS/TCIM Coordination of the Niteroi Municipal Health Foundation, including some awareness-raising meetings for managers and professionals in Niteroi's public health network (through the PDPA Project), the celebration of Pediatrician's Day at the Getúlio Vargas Filho Municipal Hospital - “Getulinho” (IGEDES, 2023) and the Nursing Week program at the Niteroi Health Foundation's Permanent Education Center.
";"The aforementioned projects have brought important contributions to the fields of research, teaching and extension, with regard to PICS/TCIM, including work with Circular Dances, benefiting the academic community, health professionals and the population. This practice has proved to be an important tool for education, prevention and the promotion of integral health, in line with the principles established by the PNPIC.

This course aimed to train professionals with a transdisciplinary profile in Integrative Health, fostering the development of competencies such as: effective communication with the interacting agent (patient) to provide welcoming care; critical analysis of clinical cases, seeking therapeutic balance and integrative practices best suited to the situations presented; and empathetic and decisive interaction with individuals of diverse backgrounds in various social and professional contexts, adopting a facilitative approach to identify the most appropriate/beneficial integrative practice for the interacting agent (patient). This approach promotes health, taking into account conventional care in conjunction with comprehensive care, incorporating the complexity of each individual in individualized, humanized treatment, and reclaiming the concept of health in its totality. The specialization sought to train professionals capable of understanding the biopsychosocial-cultural factors of interacting agents, encouraging collaboration across different areas of knowledge for more humanized and effective care. The initiative reflected a global trend of valuing integrative health, aligning with the contemporary needs of a more comprehensive health system centered on the person, family, society, and planet.";"This study aimed to evaluate the impact of the training, and the applicability of the practices presented during the specialization in the personal and professional lives of the students.
The study included eleven students who completed the Specialization Course in Integrative Health. A structured questionnaire was administered to all participants, developed by the course coordinators to assess the incorporation, applicability, and impact of integrative practices in their daily lives.";The study identified the adherence, changes, and challenges of integrative practices in areas such as self-care, learning and applicability in personal and professional life, stress management, and quality of life. Adherence to the multidimensional conception, considering the physical, metabolic, vital, mental, and supra-mental dimensions, was also observed. Greater incorporation was verified in daily self-care practices, including meditative practices, increased awareness in nutrition, use of floral remedies, yoga practice, and more frequent physical exercise.;The primary lesson learned was the integration of these practices into daily routines. Despite the constant influx of health information, the specialization fostered awareness of self-care and its importance. Small daily actions and movements were recognized as essential for creating changes in habits and behaviors, often ingrained. It is these small changes that will corroborate for a consistency in personal, professional, social, and planetary life, thereby setting examples for others and contributing to collective well-being. Despite the challenges encountered, the study demonstrated that with knowledge, persistence, and application of integrative practices, these practices have become increasingly present, contributing to humanized care and improvements in health promotion and maintenance, as well as in disease prevention. This study confirmed the importance of self-care in the context of caregiving. Initiatives such as the Specialization Courses in Integrative Health are fundamental for shifting paradigms in the field of health, based on a holistic view that integrates the human being, society, and the planet. The inclusion of disciplines with this perspective in the university environment not only broadens collective awareness of individual and environmental responsibilities but also prepares future professionals to act with a multidimensional approach – essential for contemporary challenges.;"Integrative Medicine; Academic Training; Professional Development; Health Education; Self Care"

This work describes the experience of an indigenous university student at UFPB, a Biomedicine major and daughter of a Potiguara Majé (an indigenous healer and spirituality guide), regarding the traditional use of embaúba water (Cecropia sp.) in her community. The tree, known for its medicinal properties, has its sap collected in a ritual during the full moon, when it releases the highest amount of liquid. The ritual, led by Majé Amanacy, involves requesting permission from the plant’s spirit and carefully collecting the sap at night. The gathered water is distributed and primarily used to treat kidney ailments.  

Description

Since ancient times, ancestral knowledge has provided physical and spiritual healing through the forces of nature and the power of medicinal plants. The embaúba (Cecropia sp.) is a medicinal plant with various therapeutic properties distributed across its parts, and it grows abundantly throughout Brazil. Its use as an herbal remedy has been widely popularized by indigenous peoples, who consider it sacred. The Potiguara people refer to its sap as ""água da embaúba"" (embaúba water). Its name originates from the Tupi language, meaning ""hollow tree."" Ants often nest inside its trunk, and it is also known as the ""sloth tree"" because these animals feed on its leaves and fruits.  This work recounts the experience of an indigenous Biomedicine student at the Federal University of Paraíba, a teaching assistant in Phytotherapy, and the daughter of a Potiguara Majé from Rio Tinto, Paraíba. It aims to portray her experiences with collecting embaúba water in her community. Majé refers to an indigenous healer who works with care and spirituality.";The Potiguara people in Paraíba are located on the northern coast, with their population distributed across urban areas and 33 villages. Majé Amanacy, a Potiguara healer, resides in the rural zone of Rio Tinto, performing healing practices and rituals with medicinal plants. The use of embaúba water in this community is an ancestral practice, preserved and conducted by Pajés (shamans) and Majés (shamans/healers), who guide and care for both physical and spiritual health. This knowledge is passed down through generations, from childhood to adulthood, as part of identity formation and cultural belonging. ;The collection of this water takes place in a ritual involving community members, beginning at 6 PM on the first night of the full moon. The Majé identifies a female tree (recognizable by its fruits), and together, they ask permission from the plant’s spirit before touching it. This request is made with respect and concentration, in silence or through chants. In this dialogue, the Majé explains the need to make an incision in the tree to collect its water and help a sick person in need.  After this spiritual connection, the embaúba’s root is carefully cleaned, removing excess soil, and a precise cut is made. A one-liter bottle is attached to collect the slowly dripping sap. This process is carried out with great care to ensure proper collection, as not a single drop should be wasted—according to elders, each drop is precious. The dripping continues throughout the night, ending around 6 AM. During this time, participants sing to the spirits of Mother Nature, maintaining a firm intention to receive the tree’s permission, which is signaled by the first drops of the precious liquid.  This ritual occurs during the first three nights of the full moon, collecting an average of 200 ml of embaúba water per night. At the end, all collected sap is combined into a single one-liter bottle, labeled, and stored in a refrigerator. It is distributed to people with kidney ailments for oral use—50 ml three times a day for adults, and one tablespoon three times a day for children, alternating with mineral water.  Many in the community attest to its efficacy, especially in cases of kidney stones, which users claim have dissolved without surgical intervention. According to Majé Amanacy, embaúba water is most abundant during the full moon, with the clearest and most watery sap released on the third night. In a review study describing the main characteristics of the Cecropia genus, Daga et al. (2020) note that this genus belongs to the Urticaceae family, with a wide diversity of species across South America. In folk medicine, it has various uses, including as a hypoglycemic, antihypertensive, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and sedative agent. The authors highlight that Cecropia species have been studied for their phytochemical properties, with key compounds including orientin, isoorientin, isovitexin, vitexin, and C-glycosyl flavonoids.;For the student, participating in these rituals has deeply influenced her personal and academic journey, allowing her to experience the spiritual strength involved in the ceremonies and to deeply understand the connection between nature, ancestry, and healing. These experiences enable her to integrate her people’s traditional knowledge with academic learning in Biomedicine, applying pharmacological insights while respecting practices of hygiene, labeling, and storage.  These experiences have been enriching, strengthening her identity as an indigenous woman and future healthcare professional. She has learned the importance of listening, respect, spirituality, and connection with nature as guiding principles in the healing process. She sees it as her mission to continue this legacy, sharing the knowledge of embaúba water and ensuring that indigenous ancestral medicine remains alive, respected, and valued.;"Embaúba; indigenous medicine; Cecropia"

Expanding ICT into Europe presents unique challenges and opportunities, particularly in countries with varying cultural contexts, healthcare structures, and mental health needs. ICT has expressed itself into many contexts beyond the material needs, but also emotional concerns that are linked with how to live in amplified diversity with so much austerity, autonomy but without losing connection, respect and good ambience. 
";"The open door to ICT in Europe was through francophones, in some workshops, conferences by the professor Adalberto Barreto and other main characters as Jean Pierre Boyer, Nicole Hugon, Christine Hertig, Christiane Feneon in France and Switzerland, that visualized in the 90’s a based brazilian methodology of mutual hosting care.

Today in Paris in two neighborhoods, at the Mairie of the arrondissement 15eme and 19eme, on saturdays mornings it has an open room that anyone who wants to take care of you mental health is welcome too, but mostly of the people who arrive are migrants from different roots. In this safe space they found good ambience that hosted them as people, with kind, warm arms and freedom to share your histories and feelings.
Therefore in Brussels since 2014 many associations have opened their doors to the facilitators and instructors of ICT to provide and promote rounds of solidarity care. This city is known by its own plurality and divergences but also wherever takes place in critical moments ICT has shown itself a complementary tool to deal with emotional and social concerns, to families, friends and neighborhoods. Talking out about the ones who are nearby, Netherlands also approached to Belgium in 2019 and other hubs that integrate this network of ICT like TCI Rhone Alpes-FR, MISC Portugal and MISMEC 4 Varas-BR; those different places collaborate to spread this methodology and provide training to a group of people to start hosting rounds of ICT in their villages.

In Portugal, the Division for Youth of the Cascais City Council developed a health project targeting people aged 12 to 30. Participants have access to Clinical Psychology and Nutrition consultations, as well as ICT circles. These circles take place once a week and typically include an average of five participants, mostly young women. Common concerns raised include exam and test anxiety, difficulties in socializing, resistance to parental authority, frustration related to struggles with anorexia, and dependency on mobile phones. The participants identified several key coping strategies they found helpful, such as practicing acceptance, developing negotiation skills, valuing parents as a source of comfort and security, trusting their intuition when making decisions, reinterpreting problems and allowing them to pass, stargazing, and engaging in ICT activities.
Later on Belgium, Italy, Ukraine, etc. this systemic integrative approach that gathers people around a circle in the period of 60’’ to 90’’ minutes to share life with respect, talking in “I” statements, its own life history with joy and sorrows, that explorate an active listening with no judgments or advices and rather expressing owns selves with poems, songs, smiles, hugs and tears. It's an open space to learn about its struggles and even share coping strategies.

In England, we are looking to open up space to host ICT in England through implementing both in academic settings with Clinical Psychology trainees and in the community with carers of brain injury survivors. With Clinical Psychology trainees, ICT sessions are integrated into the training curriculum, aiming to enhance the trainees' understanding of community mental health and their ability to facilitate group therapy sessions and to engage with diverse populations. This setting provides a space for trainees to learn and reflect on the therapeutic process while enhancing their clinical skills. In the community, ICT is implemented with carers of brain injury survivors, addressing the psychosocial challenges these carers face in supporting their loved ones. The community-based approach fosters mutual support, emotional expression, and resilience-building among carers, who often experience high levels of stress and isolation.
";ICT has been present to 46 countries since it began in Brazil, into the community of 4 Varas, that are localised into the Pirambu’s Favela, that's a vulnerable neighborhood of the city of Fortaleza, Ceará. ;"In both contexts, ICT offers a potential solution to address current mental health struggles and the strain on public health systems, particularly in light of long waiting times and the lack of qualified professionals. However, limitations include the need for cultural adaptation and potential challenges in maintaining engagement across diverse groups. Despite these challenges, ICT provides a promising approach to community mental health, offering new possibilities for promoting biopsychossocial health in Europe.

ICT is a structured, culturally sensitive therapeutic practice that draws on community strengths and dialogue. It is grounded in five key pillars: systemic thinking, cultural anthropology, communication theory, Paulo Freire’s emancipatory pedagogy, and resilience theory.
In Malawi’s Dzaleka Refugee Camp—home to approximately 60,000 African refugees displaced by war—ICT was introduced to address acute psychosocial stress. This distress arose not only from the long-term impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, which disrupted communal bonds and caused personal losses, but also from the anticipated withdrawal of humanitarian aid. In 2025, international policy changes led to the closure of the UNHCR office, suspension of health services, and school shutdowns due to halted staff salaries. ICT aimed to offer a safe, culturally grounded space for emotional expression, support, and resilience-building within existing community structures.
In the Ivory Coast (2022–2024), ICT was integrated into the Trust Fund for the Victims programme to support the regeneration of communities affected by the 2011 genocide. Training was delivered to three local NGOs, empowering participants as peer facilitators. Communities previously dependent on material aid began reclaiming ownership of their healing.";"In Malawi, 11 ICT sessions were facilitated in 2024 and 9 in 2025, involving 43 local educators, healthcare and psychosocial workers, and 35 community leaders and youth. Sessions were conducted in English, with interpretation into French and Swahili, and adapted to local narratives. In Ivory Coast, ICT training enabled trained facilitators to conduct circles that responded to the community’s grief, economic hardship, and historical trauma. This approach aimed to reduce psychological distress, strengthen collective coping mechanisms, amplify local voices, and foster resilience among those most affected by trauma and systemic instability.

A complete training on ICT has been offered to three different local ONGs, empowering participants to become peer facilitators and agents of change. Participants reported suffering collective grief, economic problems, and the destruction of their homes. The ICT has fostered resilience at individual, family and community levels. After the genocide in many cities of the Ivory Coast, the communities had to organize themselves with their own ressources and help from ONGs and other humanitarian organizations that developed projects mostly focused on material assistance. On one hand, this has led to dependence and expectations that solutions would come from abroad. On the other hand, the communities have organized themselves around their own religious beliefs, women's movements and other associations that were enoughly prepared to receive new models of projects. 
";"Outcomes included strengthened community ties, reduced stigma, emotional healing, and enhanced local leadership. ICT offered an inclusive “brave space,” or espace d'écoute, parole et lien (space for listening, speaking, and connection). In both countries, participants found solidarity and empowerment through shared experience. The framework resonated strongly with traditional African values of collectivity and Ubuntu, which views knowledge as rooted in interconnectedness and reciprocity, regardless of age or status.

In Ivory Coast, the Trust Fund for the Victim´s program which the ICT training, among other actions directed to regenerating the communities. In the words of a young participant in the training who was already in the field, in other actions, “the ICT changed completely my relation with the community. I used to come here and develop projects for them, now I feel summoned to be in a horizontal relationship. When I´m in the circle, I feel I need to share my own experiences too, not just be there as someone from outside who comes to help. In the circle, we´re all together.”  ";"Key challenges included logistical issues (e.g., translation, transportation) and cultural adaptation of ICT materials. Practical recommendations for future implementation include: employing a “train-the-trainer” model to build local capacity; partnering with trusted community leaders and organisations, embedding ICT in existing health or educational frameworks, ensuring sustainability beyond initial project funding.  This South-South collaboration highlights ICT’s relevance and adaptability in LMIC contexts. It reinforces the potential of community-led mental health practices to democratise care, foster resilience, and honour indigenous approaches to healing. 

ICT is also known as a brave space to be, to share, to learn, and between the francophones mostly called as espace de ecoute, parole et lien, space of listening, talking and bounding, or even circle space. That's probably one of the good lines that align to ICT and facilitate contact with people, who are often precariously looking for strategies to solve its injuries or even to take out the pebble in the shoes, that whoever is using the shoes, causing suffering, hurting, but doesn't impeach the walk of a journey, in the other hand need to be solved with strategies and good coping, nor just “rid jagged” and put aside.";"ICT; Community-base-care; biopsychossocial health; integrative care"

I also aim to share the applicability of some oils as per example the Citrus Oils - known for relieving stress, anxiety, depression and nervousness. It is clinically proven in studies that the citrus oils normalize endocrine hormone levels and immune function. In the wards, it helps to improve the physical, mental and emotional health of patients.";highly complex mental disorders (example: borderline, bipolar disorder, depression, severe cases of depression, schizofrenia, eating disorders and etc) and its symptoms.;"Aromatherapy applied to mental health has been highlighted as an important therapeutic tool in the maintenance/recovery of health, well-being and quality of life, with a positive and special impact on the treatment of patients with Mental Disorders, from the mildest to the most severe, of greater complexity.

 - minimize side effects of traditional medication
 - greater adherence to the treatment
 - balance emotions
 - support to socialization

With 10,520 inhabitants, the city gradually adopted integrative and complementary practices (PICs), reflecting a commitment to expanded care and health system comprehensiveness as a counterpoint to biomedical dominance. 

Yoga, originating from the Indian tradition, engages practitioners at physical, mental, emotional, energetic, and spiritual levels, aiming toward holistic self-integration. Hatha Yoga—one of its branches—strengthens both body and mind through the practice of postures (?sanas), breathing techniques (pr???y?mas), concentration, and relaxation. Its benefits include stress reduction, regulation of the nervous and respiratory systems, sleep stabilization, enhancement of psychophysical vitality, hormonal balance, immune system strengthening, improved concentration and creativity, and mental re-education—all positively impacting mood and quality of life. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends Yoga for integration into national health systems. 

Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), an ancient medical system, emphasizes harmonious interrelationships among the body’s components. It is grounded in the Yin–Yang theory, which categorizes the world into two complementary yet opposing principles, aiming to harmonize this duality (Brasil, 2006). 
This experience aimed to promote self-care among SUS users through the systematic introduction of Yoga, Acupuncture, Auriculotherapy, Reiki, and Aromatherapy. The goals included strengthening user–professional bonds, enhancing shared responsibility, and reducing excessive medicalization. 

The implementation of PICs in Benedito Novo began in 2016 with Yoga offered in primary care groups, expanding to include auriculotherapy, acupuncture, Reiki, and aromatherapy from 2017 to the present, guided by both professional training and community demand. Activities took place in community and health center settings, following specific protocols: weekly 60-minute Yoga sessions; individual acupuncture and auriculotherapy consultations with prior assessments; Reiki sessions; and essential-oil use and art therapy in workshop settings—each conducted by trained professionals. 

 



 

 ";"The initiative involved primary care nurses trained in PICs and SUS users experiencing chronic conditions or mild-to-moderate psychological distress. Municipal administration provided infrastructure and institutional approval. All practices were voluntary and conducted ethically, adhering to the SUS principles of beneficence, autonomy, and non-maleficence, with activities recorded internally. 

Key challenges included the absence of clear local operational guidelines and insufficient specialized human resources. Traditional professional training hindered PIC acceptance, causing discontinuities and limited reach due to staff turnover and reliance on individual initiatives. Resistance from some healthcare professionals—particularly physicians favoring purely pharmaceutical interventions—was observed. Financial sustainability presented a barrier, with no earmarked funding, reliance on volunteer labor, and difficulties sourcing supplies. ";Despite these challenges, PIC implementation led to subjective health improvements: decreased chronic pain, reduced anxiety and depression, improved sleep, and enhanced vitality. Strengthened bonds between professionals and users were observed, and the practices functioned as educational tools promoting autonomy and redefined care perspectives. Internal records noted fewer consultations for non-specific complaints and reduced use of anxiolytics and analgesics. Group testimonials indicated boosted self-esteem, well-being, and coping ability for chronic conditions. The objectives of promoting self-care, reinforcing user–professional connection, and integrating PICs into primary care were largely fulfilled. ;"In high-income countries where biomedical models predominate, integrative practices are gradually increasing, paralleled by growing scientific research. This scientific and institutional surge is driven by mass public demand, attributable to several factors: accessibility, dissatisfaction with impersonal, invasive, and iatrogenic biomedicine, appreciation for traditional medicines, and cultural movements advocating their validation (Tesser; Sousa; Nascimento, 2018). 

There is global consensus that Primary Health Care is the most appropriate setting for PICs, owing to several factors: 1) stimulation of self-healing potential, and 2) active patient participation in healing processes, enhanced by practitioner sensitivity to cultural and social contexts (WHO, 2002). 

The effective implementation of PICs requires institutional embedding in municipal policy frameworks, ongoing professional training, establishment of funded technical centers, and mixed-method impact evaluations. It is advisable to replicate the model elsewhere, build regional support networks, and conduct longitudinal studies assessing PICs’ impacts within SUS. This experience underscores the relevance of PICs as integral care tools, validating popular knowledge and individual agency and contributing to redefining healthcare practices in SUS.

Motivation: The main motivation came from the patients suffering who found no answer in conventional medicine. 
Objective: The purpose of our endeavour was to restore the sick to health which is called healing. In circumstances when no clear guidelines were given from the international community. 
Chronological secrets: Patients started flocking into our clinic as soon as ten days after receiving the first or second dose of the epigenetic treatment recommended by most governments. After attending international online conferences, we started in our team of 10 integrative medicine doctors to attend patients who’s live had been one before the epigenetic treatment and another (and sicker) after the epigenetic treatment.  To this date we still see minimum 1 patient per week affected by the intervention. 
Materials and procedures: After taking each and individual case after however receiving the same impact we proceeding to develop a protocol for detoxifying intra- and extracellular agents with Zeolith and Solarvital (Solaris) over a period of 2-3 month. The greatest impact however was achieved by administering the potentized epigenetic material (Isopathy) versus the homeopathic preparation of Hottentotus tameles 30C, 200C, MK.
Participants: we run a busy outpatient clinic in the centre of Barcelona with more or less 6000 patients attended by doctors, physiotherapists, midwifes, dietitians, body consciousness workers, kinesiologist etc. attending people from all ages and races. 
Theoretical framework: Hahnemann described in his writings that in each and every epidemy we have to search for the one agent for the genius epidemicus (Organon of homeopathic medicine). 
Ethical aspects: The patients who received our treatment had either not looked for or not found any other treatment available for the partly severe consequences of their treatment. 
";"Since there were no official guidelines and only few international forums for sharing the results for obvious reasons. 
Results limitations: Integrative medicine and homeopathy in Spain is unfortunately not fully integrated into the public health system. Only few private insurances companies cover for the expenses to be paid by the patients a) for the medicines and b) for the consultation. ";"More than 150 patients could be helped to improve or cure their problems. 
Preliminary analysis: The homeopathic adjuvant was found to be more effected than the isopathic approach. 
";"Objective assessment: Even today (June 2025) the combination of this treatment seems to be effective for the short- and long-term consequences of the epigenetic treatment. 
	Practical recommendations: After narrowing down the diagnosis of the many times surprising clinical features of patients that find no other explanations and have certain alterations in their blood analysis our protocol can be applied following the law of similar (Samuel Hahnemann) and the law of healing (C.Hering). 
Future directions: Sharing the findings on an international level with a group of doctors working with this protocol. 
Contribution to field: The experience of many of us shared after 2021, has not yet found a clear and international guideline for understanding the pathophysiological consequences of the epigenetic treatment.

The sociologist Madel Luz critiques this hegemonic model as one specific ""medical rationality"" among many, which historically overshadowed other comprehensive systems of knowledge and practice (LUZ, 2005). The institutionalization of Traditional, Complementary, and Integrative Medicine (TCIM) — known as PICS in Brazil — through the National Policy (PNPIC, 2006) represents a profound political and epistemological challenge to this hegemony. It advocates for the integration of different medical rationalities to achieve ""integralidade"" (comprehensiveness), a core principle of the Brazilian Unified Health System (SUS). This report details the author's experience, first as a student and then as a tutor, within the TCIM discipline at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ), a journey of transition from a purely biomedical viewpoint to an integrative and critical perspective on health, as discussed by Tesser and Sousa (2018).
";"This experience report aims to: 1) analyze the dual role of student-tutor as a pedagogical locus of reflection; 2) deepen the analysis of the TCIM-Primary Health Care (PHC) interface as a site of practice and resistance; and 3) discuss the pedagogical strategies and epistemological challenges in decolonizing the medical curriculum.
Methods: This report is based on a qualitative analysis of the author's experience and observations during remote weekly debates held throughout 2023. The methodology involved a critical, multidisciplinary exegesis of scientific articles, public policies, and theoretical texts on TCIM. This process fostered a reflective analysis of the tensions between different knowledge systems within medical training.
";"Results and Discussion: Three interconnected analytical axes emerged, revealing the discipline's transformative potential.
Decolonization and the Ecology of Knowledges: The course functions as a laboratory for what the sociologist Boaventura de Sousa Santos calls an ""ecology of knowledges."" This concept proposes moving beyond ""abyssal thinking""—the Western tendency to relegate non-scientific knowledge to a space of non-existence. Instead, it fosters a dialogue where ancestral wisdom (e.g., herbalism, Amazonian shamanism) and other medical rationalities are recognized as legitimate, promoting ""cognitive justice"" (SANTOS, 2007). This directly confronts the colonial legacy within medicine, which systematically discredited and suppressed traditional healing practices.


Strengthening Integrality in Primary Health Care: The synergy between TCIM and PHC is profound. While the biomedical model provides essential tools for acute conditions, TCIM offers technologies of care that enhance the core attributes of PHC. Practices like acupuncture, meditation, and therapeutic touch provide new avenues for managing chronic pain, mental health, and stress-related conditions. As argued by Tesser (2009), they enrich the therapeutic encounter, improve the clinician-patient relationship, and strengthen longitudinality and comprehensiveness (integralidade), responding to dimensions of human suffering that often elude a purely biological diagnosis.


Curricular Resistance and the Hidden Curriculum: The explicit curriculum of the discipline was often met with resistance from some students, a phenomenon that can be understood through the concept of the ""hidden curriculum."" Medical training implicitly socializes students to value high-tech, hospital-based, and specialist-driven medicine, while often devaluing PHC, generalist practice, and low-cost care technologies (LUZ, 2015). This ingrained value system creates resistance to TCIM, which is often misperceived as ""unscientific"" or ""soft."" Overcoming this requires not just presenting evidence, but creating pedagogical spaces for students to critically reflect on the historical and political construction of medical ""truth.""";"The TCIM discipline at UFRJ is far more than an add-on; it is a critical space for curricular decolonization and for training physicians who are more reflective, critical, and aligned with the founding principles of the SUS. The dual experience as a student and tutor underscores that integrating these practices is an ongoing epistemological struggle that challenges the very foundations of medical colonialism. To truly advance integrative care, it is imperative to expand such initiatives and create structural changes in the medical curriculum that normalize and value a true ecology of health knowledges.

Integrated into cancer care, Restorative Yoga alleviates muscular and joint tension, improves breathing, and supports restoration. This report describes the free, volunteer-based Restorative Yoga program at ZENCancer Institute over seven years, aimed at enhancing well-being in oncology patients via accessible integrative care.
The ZENCancer Institute (IZC) is a nonprofit organization that emerged after its founder experienced breast cancer and sought Traditional, Complementary and Integrative Medicine (TCIM) together with chemotherapy treatment, with the aim of reducing stress, strengthening the immune system and improving quality of life. Currently, IZC supports over 400 cancer patients across 11 Brazilian states and internationally, including participants from Portugal. 


Originally offered in person in a space provided by its founder in Rio de Janeiro (year 2018), the Restorative Yoga program expanded considerably when it shifted to an online model during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, when it was necessary the adapt due to social distancing. In 2021 Restorative Yoga was offered online four times a week. And in June 2022, in person practices were resumed and online practices were maintained. Currently, Restorative Yoga sessions run regularly in person at two Rio de Janeiro locations and one in Jundiaí (SP), lasting 90 minutes, and online twice weekly for 60 minutes.";Restorative Yoga at the ZENCancer Institute was originally designed to support cancer patients in coping with common side effects of treatment, including fatigue, anxiety, muscle and joint pain, and sleep disturbances. By encouraging deep rest through supported postures and conscious stillness, the practice helps regulate the nervous system, ease physical discomfort, and foster emotional resilience. As the program expanded, it began to include individuals experiencing chronic stress, emotional exhaustion, and persistent pain unrelated to cancer. Today, the practice addresses a broad spectrum of biopsychosocial challenges, offering a therapeutic resource for those navigating illness, caregiving, or the cumulative pressures of everyday life.;From March 2022 to August 2023, and in October 2024, a participant survey were carried out in order to assess their experience of practicing Restorative Yoga at the IZC, with guiding questions about the type of practice, the perceived benefits, positive points, discomfort, among others, and their suggestions and comments demonstrate that we are on the right track and that the model developed by the IZC is capable of providing socialization and a sense of belonging to a community, both in person and online, helping participants to experience the challenges present at any stage of cancer treatment in a lighter and calmer way, feeling welcomed and welcoming to each other.;"During the period of social distancing, in which the transition from the in-person to the online modality took place, important challenges were presented for offering the practice of Restorative Yoga, highlighting the need to enhance the instructors' skills in giving the verbal commands of the advanced postures, due to the impossibility of hands-on adjustments, as occurs in the in-person format, which was solved by instructor training. Another difficult was patients’ limited access to standard yoga props at home. To maintain continuity, the institute’s founder assembled and distributed restorative kits — including eye pillows and lavender spray — to previous in-person participants. Instructors encouraged use of common household items such as pillows, blankets, towels, and books, revealing that minimal resources still yield meaningful benefits. The shift also increased engagement, attracting new volunteers and participants from diverse regions and treatment stages. Postures were adapted for bed-based practice to ensure accessibility. Importantly, a virtual support network spontaneously formed between volunteers and patients, fostering emotional connection and solidarity during social isolation.
Key recommendations include adaptable protocols for both online and in-person formats, instructor training in verbal cueing, and encouraging use of accessible household props. Expanding access to caregivers and those with chronic stress has strengthened the program’s impact.";"Restorative yoga; well-being; welcoming; Integrative Oncology"

Tuina has multiple demonstrated benefits in modulating blood flow, improving recovery after sports injuries, decreasing inflammation, improving joint mobility, and mitigating chronic pain. As a central component of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), Tuina has been demonstrated to be a safe and effective alternative to physiotherapy in management of chronic nonspecific low back pain, and potentially superior in other conditions including knee osteoarthritis.;Despite these benefits, Tuina faces multiple barriers to widespread adoption in mainstream healthcare, including poor awareness of Tuina’s benefits and a deficit of available practitioners. To address these barriers, Expert Manipulative Massage Automation (EMMA) robotic massagers are being used to improve access to Tuina services. EMMA is a robotic massage device that uses Artificial Intelligence to identify areas of muscular stiffness to deliver Tuina therapy and may represent a safe and effective modality to extend the availability of Tuina massage beyond its current capabilities. Previous work at Mayo Clinic has demonstrated that use of EMMA is safe, effective, acceptable, and well tolerated, and we believe that it may be a valuable tool for widespread dissemination of Tuina as a treatment modality.;We are currently conducting a randomized controlled trial comparing the feasibility and efficacy of robotically administered Tuina therapy via EMMA to massage received from a certified massage therapist.  Study outcomes will include patient satisfaction, pain intensity and pain interference with daily activities as measured through Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) scales.;"Previous studies have demonstrated patient satisfaction with robot-administered Tuina massage and we believe that EMMA is a safe and effective modality to expand access to Tuina therapy. By conducting this randomized controlled trial, we hope to gain further insights into the efficacy and tolerability of EMMA as compared to certified massage therapy. We hope that this continues to enhance the popularity of Tuina as an effective treatment modality for the treatment of lower back pain.  

EMMA, an AI-enabled, adaptive robotic massage therapeutic device, provides a safe and feasible option to extend the capabilities of Tuina providers, thereby improving access to an effective Traditional Chinese Medicine modality.

Learning from the beginning the importance of dialogue between traditional and scientific knowledge, and the development of both, the Phytotherapy monitors were able to experience one of the greatest examples of traditional knowledge in the region: buying herbs from a herbalist. Thus, this work is an experience report by monitors from the Federal University of Paraíba about this experience.

Description

Phytotherapy is a therapeutic resource that uses medicinal plants in various pharmaceutical preparations. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), herbal medicine, as part of traditional medicine, is widely used worldwide. Although it faces challenges, particularly regarding regulation, the WHO is committed to overcoming them by integrating these traditional medicines into the national health systems of member countries, establishing quality standards, and promoting research and the training of specialized professionals.  In Brazil, although the use of herbal medicine is strongly linked to traditional knowledge, scientific interest in this practice continues to grow. The diversity of plants and low cost make this therapy highly attractive for healthcare programs and professionals, contributing to its strengthening within the Unified Health System (SUS). Moreover, the success of this therapeutic approach among the population is largely due to the cultural roots of this practice, guided by healers, midwives, and herbalists.";Public markets and street fairs are common settings in many Brazilian cities. They not only provide a space for purchasing food and generating income but also preserve a variety of traditions that develop through interpersonal interactions. Herbalists, as they are known, typically make a living by selling medicinal plants and spices and are quite popular in these places. These individuals often possess practical knowledge about the identification, harvesting, preparation, and use of plants to treat illnesses. Some have inherited this knowledge from their ancestors and are involved in the entire process, from cultivation to commercialization (Araujo et al., 2014).  Phytotherapy is a treatment modality where the therapeutic active constituents come from plants or plant derivatives. In Brazil, it is included in the Unified Health System under the scope of Integrative and Complementary Health Practices (Brazil, 2006). This allows, for example, a reduction in the use of allopathic medicines, offering a better cost-benefit ratio for users, in addition to being a deeply rooted practice due to sociocultural, economic, and historical development.  At the Federal University of Paraíba (UFPB), the Herbal Medicine course is offered to various health-related programs (Nursing, Physical Therapy, Speech Therapy, Nutrition, Dentistry, Biomedicine, Medicine, and Occupational Therapy). The Herbal Medicine monitoring program has some unique aspects, as the monitor is constantly in contact with both scientific and academic knowledge as well as traditional knowledge. Thus, they learn to bridge the gap between these two forms of knowledge, which is the core of this work. The monitor has access to various opportunities, ranging from deepening expertise in a specific field to assisting other students and experiencing everyday teaching situations. This work reports the experience of Herbal Medicine monitors from the Federal University of Paraíba during 2025, when they visited the Central Public Market of João Pessoa/PB. The purpose of the visit was to purchase medicinal plants from a herbalist to supply the Herbal Medicine laboratory.   The visit took place on February, 2025, with the participation of a professor and two monitors.;For one of the monitors, the initial impression was of an environment filled with different aromas and a variety of stimuli, leaving her momentarily disoriented. Although she knew herbalists offered various plants, she also noticed the presence of spices and fruits. The herbs were organized in large sacks or stacked, tied with plastic strips. While an employee assisted the professor, she observed the interactions between people and the herbalist. Customers reporting their symptoms showed a high degree of trust in the seller’s recommendations, recognizing him as a true holder of knowledge. For the other monitor, what stood out most was how the herbs were separated into portions without labels. The herbalist could identify the plants at a glance, naming them and describing their properties. This made the monitor realize that she was used to recognizing herbs only by labels on laboratory bottles and that she could also use aspects like smell, color, and texture, just as the herbalist did. This experience led her to value the organoleptic and botanical aspects of herbs in her practice, a lesson she intends to share with other students during her monitoring.;Monitoring, as an educational practice in higher education, seeks to facilitate the teaching-learning process, allowing students to deepen their knowledge and experience teaching, both at the university and in real-life situations. The monitors realized that the guidance of herbalists aligns with scientific knowledge, demonstrating that traditional knowledge, has its foundations and serves as a basis for scientific research.;"phytotherapy; Medicinal plants; Students"

This practice is based on the premise that individuals are intrinsically connected to their family systems, and that unresolved conflicts within these systems may manifest in various forms, such as relational difficulties, physical illness, emotional blockages, and psychosocial traumas. In the field of healthcare, FC is understood as a light technology, as it emphasizes care centered on listening, subjectivity, and expanding relational awareness.
Recently recognized as an Integrative and Complementary Health Practice (PICS) by Brazil's Unified Health System (SUS), FC has officially been included within the scope of nursing practice, as stipulated by COFEN Resolution No. 739/2024. This institutional recognition opens space for its inclusion in both care and educational practices within the context of comprehensive health care. However, there remains significant lack of awareness about FC among healthcare professionals, as well as resistance related to its legitimacy and clinical applicability.
In light of this scenario, an educational initiative was conducted during the Nursing Week promoted by the Regional Nursing Council of Rio Grande do Sul (COREN-RS), with the aim of demystifying Family Constellation among nursing professionals, broadening their understanding of its application, and encouraging qualification in the field of integrative practices. The activity consisted of an introductory lecture followed by a practical workshop, engaging approximately 50 participants.
";The objective was to demystify the topic of CF belonging to PICS, which is still not widely known as a mediator of problems and facilitator of self-contemplation, reaching a specific audience of professionals with the potential to become replicators and enthusiasts of the topic.;"During the activity, several challenges were identified. The main obstacle was prejudice toward FC, often associated with esoteric or unscientific practices. This perception generated initial resistance among some participants, reinforcing the need for educational strategies to legitimize it as a valid care practice. Additionally, the absence of a fully adequate environment—in terms of silence and privacy—partially compromised the quality of the experience. A lack of specific training on the topic among participants was also noted, along with a shortage of accessible educational materials and scientific references in Portuguese, which hindered the deepening of the content presented.
Despite these challenges, the results were significantly positive. The experience elicited a variety of emotional responses from participants, including the desire for physical contact (hugging), feelings of bitterness, empathy, sadness, and joy. The testimonials highlighted the impact of the dynamic in sensitizing professionals and demonstrated FC's capacity to provoke deep self-reflection and interpersonal awareness. By the end of the activity, many participants expressed interest in pursuing further training in PICS, particularly in Family Constellation, as a strategy to broaden their therapeutic repertoire and implement more integrative care practices.
The experience demonstrated that FC can be understood as a powerful light technology, fostering self-care, sensitive listening, and the re-signification of emotional suffering. Its application in continuing education spaces, dialogue circles, and therapeutic workshops proved feasible and effective, both for strengthening professional practice and for humanizing healthcare delivery. Based on the outcomes obtained, it is recommended that similar educational activities be expanded within healthcare and educational institutions, and that FC-related content be included in nursing education curricula.
";"It is also suggested to encourage national scientific production on the topic to generate robust evidence supporting its legitimacy within the health field. Developing accessible educational materials and adaptable clinical protocols for health service contexts is also essential for its practical implementation. Furthermore, raising awareness among managers and multidisciplinary teams is crucial to strengthen the institutional recognition of FC as an integrative and humanized care strategy. Additionally, it is recommended to promote the training of nurses as qualified facilitators, capable of conducting FC practices with ethics, technical rigor, and responsibility.
In conclusion, the reported experience contributes to advancing knowledge about integrative practices in nursing and reinforces the role of health professionals in delivering care that is sensitive to the emotional and relational dimensions of human experience. In this context, Family Constellation emerges as a promising tool for promoting health, valuing subjectivity, and fostering more balanced and healthier relationships in both care delivery and health management.

Possibilities were developed for the creation of a new course at the Faculty of Medicine of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro that addresses Integrative and Complementary Health Practices using active methodologies. The course ran from March 2020 to January 2025. The course began with a challenge that none of us had ever experienced before: the new Coronavirus pandemic. This report aims to describe the process of creating the elective course “Introduction to Traditional Medicines and PICS” and to reflect on the experiences of students and teachers involving the protagonism that was necessary in this teaching-learning process.
In Brazil, PICS was marked by the publication of the National Policy in 2006, which emphasizes their inclusion in Primary Health Care, contributing to the increased resolvability of the system with continuous, humanized, and comprehensive care (BRAZIL, 2006). In this sense, with regard to the university, the premise of the PICS approach in undergraduate health courses arises, in order to create learning opportunities related to this field of knowledge for students. The reforms of the Pedagogical Political Projects of Medical Schools, based on the 2014 National Curriculum Guidelines (DCNs), became urgent in order to enable the necessary transformations. At that time, there was already recognition of the need to mobilize different areas of knowledge and health care technologies, since there are different types of complexity regarding health problems (BRASIL, 2014).
Undergraduate studies are a privileged moment for exposing students to experiences and knowledge about the health-disease process and the doctor-patient relationship, as well as social and cultural dimensions. 
In this context, it was important to promote coordination and integration among medical students at different stages of the course, starting in the third semester, since this could contribute to the training of professionals capable of ensuring quality health actions and services for the population (VIEIRA, 2016). Twenty-five places were made available for undergraduate students in the Medicine course at UFRJ. As a theoretical framework, the novelty of knowledge of Complementary and Integrative Traditional Medicines and their different Medical Rationalities that support them emerges. The presentation of Integrative and Complementary Health Practices, its current legislation with an emphasis on transdisciplinarity and the humanization of care, allowed for an expansion of scientific knowledge.
The challenging moment of the COVID-19 pandemic brought reflections on social isolation and student demands. In this context, teachers identified the urgency of new perspectives to deal with an uncertain future and the need to choose tools that promote self-knowledge and a way of being in health care. The theoretical framework and selected experiences contributed to the intention to mitigate anxiety and raise awareness during this period. For immersion in the PICS theme, emergency activities were initially carried out remotely during this period of the pandemic, addressing topics such as Mindfulness, Music Therapy, and Yoga.
In a second phase, starting in August 2021, practical PICS workshops were held in person with interactive roundtables, enabling student participation and motivation, thus allowing them to learn about and experience PICS in different types of care. The visit to the Thematic Collection of Medicinal Plants at the Rio de Janeiro Botanical Garden provided successful experiences with the possibility of learning about certified medicinal plant species, culminating in a collective Tai Chi Chuan practice and group social gathering.";"The challenges that motivated the creation of the course included the recognition of the institution's traditional medical training and the need to fill this gap, ensuring access to the scientific knowledge and evidence of MTCI/PICS.
";"During the Covid-19 pandemic, the experience allowed for a teaching-learning process that valued lightness, self-care, and self-knowledge. The content presented in an interactive way provided students with information about tools in this regard. They emphasized that the practices were adopted in their daily routine, increasing their well-being and self-knowledge and reducing anxiety, allowing for a comprehensive and sensitive approach. 
The novelty of the creation of the elective course “Introduction to Traditional Medicines and PICS” at the UFRJ School of Medicine allowed future medical professionals access to scientific knowledge and evidence of MTCI/PICS, providing a more comprehensive and holistic education.";The UFRJ School of Medicine is an institution that presents gaps and resistance in the use of medical rationalities that differ from biomedical logic. There is an urgent need to expand teaching, care, and research spaces for medicines based on different traditions. It is possible for them to participate in a common institutional field. The experience of introducing the elective course on PICS into the UFRJ Medicine Course has proven successful and promising in this expansion, considering the relevance of a compulsory course in the course curriculum.;": Primary Health Care; Integrative and complementary health practices; Health teaching and learning; Medical education; Undergraduate students"

The objective was to describe experiences related to the practice of medicinal gardening at a Family Clinic. Educational activities were carried out in Primary Health Care (PHC) in the municipality of Rio de Janeiro between 2013 and 2025.
               The setting for the experience was the Assis Valente Family Clinic located in the Ilha do Governador neighbourhood in the municipality of Rio de Janeiro, which had seven Family Health (SF) teams, three Oral Health teams, a Senior Citizens' Centre and a Carioca Health Academy.  The territory consisted of the Vila Joaniza and Barbante communities, with a total of 24,000 residents. It should be noted that this clinic is certified as a Medicinal Plant Friendly Unit. 
          In 2013, medical students were introduced to Integrative and Complementary Practices (PICS) at the clinic, where there was a medicinal garden. 
         The subjects of the experiment were third-year students and interns from the UFRJ School of Medicine and three teachers (a phytotherapist, a homeopath and a public health nurse), the Family Health team, the Family Health Support Centre (NASF), users and professionals, including an agricultural technician.
The decision to expose students to pedagogical experiences with the Family Health teams was based on the understanding that primary health care should be a training ground for SUS professionals and a differentiator in terms of ensuring relevant experiences for the training of competent doctors with skills to care for the populations of the territories. 
         In 2017, the immersion of third-year students in the Family Clinic enabled their inclusion in PICS activities. At that time, the unit was already a practice field for the Integrated Internship in Family and Community Medicine at the UFRJ medical school.
         In partnership with the health team and NASF, the activities of the elderly group in managing the medicinal plant garden were intensified. The students actively participated in the practices: workshops with the participation of users; botanical identification; production of seedlings from seeds and cuttings; preparation of seasonings with fresh herbs, aromatic vinegar, homemade syrup, and handmade medicinal soap. The themes were: medicinal plants in pain management, respiratory symptoms, sleep, therapeutic teas, and involved festivities such as Easter and June festivals.

     The botanical identification workshop promoted the appreciation of the participants' affective memory and experience through the exchange of knowledge. The workshops allowed for reflection on the experiences, strengthening the bonds and connections between the parties. The users' knowledge and the sharing of the students' experiences, resulting from the scientific knowledge described in scientific publications, became a reality. 

          Through the portfolio, it was possible to follow the reports and reflections of the third-year students in relation to their experiences.  At the boarding school, the Field Diary, Final Report and Thematic Work were used to record the activities.
          The visit to the Thematic Collection of Medicinal Plants at the Rio de Janeiro Botanical Garden was the highlight of the shared experiences, with the opportunity to learn about certified medicinal plant species and participate in a collective Tai Chi Chuan practice led by a PICS teacher. There was a group get-together. 

";The main difficulties encountered were resistance to mobilising staff, students and users for continuous action, facing the fragility of PICS insertion in Family Health.;"The main lessons learned were the enhancement of dialogue between teachers, students, NASF professionals and users, enabling the strengthening of PICS in PHC; the expansion of the insertion of medical students. in the ESF, enabling the construction of teaching-learning experiences within the scope of PICS and promoting contact between students and users' narratives about medicinal plants, with a view to learning about local culture. 

";Pathways are suggested for replicating and improving the internship through the creation of disciplines and curricular arrangements capable of enabling practices that produce future doctors capable of perceiving the needs of users, with a less reductionist and fragmented view. ;"Primary Health Care; Integrative and Complementary Practices; Complementary Therapies"

During classes, they develop a broad understanding of healthcare, recognizing the importance of individuals' physical, emotional, and socioeconomic aspects. Adopting this new perspective mirrors the core idea of integrative medicine: moving past the conventional framework to foster a more holistic, person-centered way of caring. This approach promotes dialogue between different knowledge and practices, prioritizing person-centered care. During the course, students are introduced to various complementary and alternative therapies, including Traditional Chinese Medicine, Meditation, and Homeopathy, among others formally recognized by the Sistema Único de Saúde (Brazilian Unified Health System). This exposure encourages students to critically examine the relevance and efficiency of these therapies in the current health landscape.;"Students frequently reflected on the importance of self-knowledge and different approaches to care, highlighting their impact on professional practice. Many of them report that this knowledge enhanced their professional outlook, providing a distinct advantage in the job market, where this aspect is often lacking. Reflection on personal limitations, self-care, and active, humanized listening emerge as valuable tools for developing more empathetic and welcoming professionals. Among the key reflections shared by students is the critical importance of both interdisciplinarity and multidisciplinarity, considered essential for effective integrative health practices. Sharing learning experiences with peers from diverse fields — including medicine, biomedicine, psychology, nursing, dentistry, nutrition, engineering, law, and administration — enriches the understanding of care, fostering a more collaborative and comprehensive approach. Interaction across different areas expands and strengthens relationships and perceptions, directly impacting the quality of professional practice. 
Despite extensive discussion of holistic approaches and multidisciplinary care concepts, a gap exists in implementing these principles in direct patient care. This disconnection hinders the effective integration of conventional practices with complementary therapies, creating a hierarchical structure related to the quality of integrative and conventional practices. To bridge this gap, fostering stronger partnerships between educational institutions and health services is crucial. Implementing specific collaboration guidelines tailored to the context can facilitate the integration of theory and practice, offering students opportunities to apply theoretical knowledge in real clinical settings. This approach reinforces student comprehension and improves care quality, promoting a more cohesive and effective professional practice. Including practical activities, such as internships and extension projects focused on integrative health, significantly contributes to student training, allowing theory to be applied in real scenarios and contextualized with the reality of health units.";;In summary, the Integrative Health discipline is crucial for developing technical and human skills. Health education becomes more comprehensive when it integrates different dimensions of care, including integrative practices, enabling professionals to work effectively in increasingly complex contexts. This increasingly highlights the need for the discipline to be included in professional training.;"Postgraduate Education; Unified Health System; Integrative Medicine; Academic Training; Health Education"

Based on the work of Dr. Edward Bach, this therapy aims to promote emotional balance and quality of life through the individualized selection of flower essences. These essences are highly diluted natural liquid extracts, typically derived from flowers, plants, or shrubs, and are used to support self-care by restoring mental and emotional equilibrium.This report describes the implementation and evolution of online Floral Therapy at the ZENCancer Institute (IZC) since 2020.
The ZENCancer Institute (IZC) was founded in 2018, inspired by the personal journey of its founder, who experienced the benefits of Traditional, Complementary and Integrative Medicine (TCIM) during cancer treatment. Since then, the institute has expanded its offerings both in-person and online, providing a range of practices including Floral Therapy, meditation, Reiki, art therapy, and yoga. Floral Therapy sessions were initially conducted in person in Rio de Janeiro and transitioned to an online format via video calls in May 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The program is supported by a team of 14 volunteer therapists and consists of 12 sessions, with the option to extend for an additional 6 sessions when needed. Up to three family members or caregivers per patient may also receive therapy. After each session, personalized essence recommendations are sent via WhatsApp, and the essences are purchased by the participant from a compounding pharmacy of their choice, and this cost is borne by the participant.";Floral Therapy at the IZC has primarily been used to support individuals experiencing emotional challenges such as fear, anxiety, and insecurity — common among those undergoing cancer treatment. These states often arise in response to illness-related stress and emotional vulnerability.;At IZC, Floral Therapy has been integrated into care pathways as a supportive strategy for emotional well-being. The continued demand for and engagement with the practice points to its perceived relevance and resonance among participants. The digitalization of various health and wellness services offers some advantages such as convenience, cost-effectiveness, availability and, above all, accessibility, which allows IZC to serve participants in 16 states in Brazil, even in other countries such as Portugal and the United States.;A relevant challenge to highlight is the fact that not all participants have  easy access to flower essences, either for financial reasons or because the essences indicated for their treatment are not available in their locality. Therefore, the group has been seeking successful partnerships with pharmacies, suppliers and flower system creators in order to minimize this challenge. In addition, other possibilities have been evaluated, such as the manipulation of florals by volunteer therapists, but the logistics of delivering the formulas must be considered. All these factors are being considered in the IZC's and the flower therapy center's tireless quest to enable oncology patients to access the benefits of TCIM which, in the context of floral therapy, can be used in a integrative and complementary way to the medical treatment received by the participant, and does not replace the conventional treatment, and helping to improve the quality of life of these patients.;"Flower Therapy; well-being; Self-Care; Quality of Life"

It connects conventional pharmaceutical care with traditional and popular knowledge based on scientific evidence that brings efficacy and safety to people.
This action promotes a powerful space for community articulation, health care and the appreciation of popular knowledge. In a territory marked by social vulnerabilities, educational actions of this magnitude carried out in a network enable the recovery of autonomy in care and promote the strengthening of territorial ties. It is also important to note that the Brazilian universal care system (SUS) recognizes the use of the traditional uses of medicinal plants as one of its recognized and accepted by the national Integrative Health Policy (BRASIL, 2006). 
From the first half of 2024 onwards, several activities were carried out in the territory, such as: 
Community medicinal garden maintenance - actions carried out at the Farol Educational Medicinal Garden, aimed at the cultivation and management of medicinal plants, providing information on basic concepts for care at home or in other spaces, addressing topics on soil preparation, planting methods, harvesting and different therapeutic uses.
Technical support for the vegetables garden Horta Cores e Sabores and revitalization at the medicinal garden at the local public heath center UBS Jardim Lídia - aiming to expand, recover and renew the existing planting on site, highlighting the importance of biodiversity, species identification, maintenance and improvement of soil quality for the healthy development of plants. 
Tea Circles - educational gatherings focusing on medicinal plants which provided information on the medicinal properties of plants, parts used, interactions with medications, adverse effects, indications for use and the different ways of preparing teas, according to the resolutions of the National Pharmaceutical Council (CFF, 2007) in addition to thematic workshops integrated with SUS monitoring groups, such as: smoking, diabetes and mental health.";Medicinal plants have always been widely used by the Capão Redondo community, being in many cases the first or only therapeutic alternative available, especially for the most vulnerable populations. However, in some cases, the frequent use of certain species, improper forms of use, associations of many species in homemade preparations that compromised people's therapeutic safety were observed.;"Through interactions with the community, it was possible to raise awareness among more and more people about the importance of nature in all aspects of health.
The approach to the rational use of plants promoted greater awareness about their use, expanding the population's knowledge about how to manage their self-care safely.
It was observed that the educational process minimizes anxiety attacks in groups from the Psychosocial Care Center, as it reduced the number of cigarettes smoked during the activity, in addition to promoting focus, concentration and collective integration in the spaces.";One of the main challenges of Integrative Pharmacy is the limitations present in many professional training courses, which still do not include a broader view of health care. This hinders the development of integrated and interprofessional practices. In addition, there is resistance to the appreciation of traditional knowledge, which compromises the integration between popular and scientific knowledge. The articulation between different health professionals is also a challenge, requiring more consolidated spaces for collective construction. Added to this are the cultural and social barriers related to trust in therapy with medicinal plants, as well as the need for greater dissemination of positive experiences already carried out in the territories.;"Integrative Pharmacy; Community medicinal Garden; Medicinal plants"

Historically, the community has relied on collective organizing — such as mothers’ clubs and housing movements — to address structural challenges. The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated mental health struggles, highlighting the need for accessible, non-stigmatizing interventions.
Farol Saúde Integrativa, a social enterprise, introduced integrative community therapy (ICT) circles —a Brazilian-origin complementary health practice (PICS) (BARRETO, 2018) — to provide emotional support and foster mutual aid considering that ICT is one of the Complementary and Integrative Health Practices (PICS) recognized and accepted by the national Integrative Health Policy (BRASIL, 2006). Sessions were held at Farol’s headquarters and two public primary healthcare units (UBS Jardim Lídia and UBS Maracá), chosen for their accessibility and community trust.
The project engaged low-income adults, predominantly women of Northeastern Brazilian migrant descent, many of whom were caregivers experiencing chronic stress, grief, and socio economic hardships.";The therapy circles aimed to address several critical challenges faced by the Capão Redondo community. Many participants had never sought mental health support due to enduring cultural stigma, which often discourages open discussions about emotional struggles. Social isolation was another key issue, particularly among women caregivers, who reported feeling overwhelmed by their responsibilities while having few opportunities for self-care. Systemic vulnerabilities—such as limited access to stable housing, education, and employment—further compounded stress and health disparities. Additionally, grief and trauma emerged as recurring themes, with participants sharing experiences of loss tied to community violence and the struggles of aging.;"The community therapy circles fostered a welcoming environment that reduced mental health stigma, encouraging participants—primarily women caregivers—to openly share their struggles. Despite low male attendance, the sessions promoted growing awareness of mental health’s importance. Most participants were new to this practice, yet all described the experience as deeply impactful, with no resistance observed during sessions. Many expressed interest in returning, underscoring the community’s need for emotional support. The circles strengthened social bonds, cultivating solidarity and a sense of belonging. Participants reported reduced anxiety and depression symptoms, improved emotional resilience, and the adoption of collective self-care practices. Key concerns raised included caregiver burnout (particularly among women with limited autonomy) and grief related to local violence or aging. By integrating with the local public health system (SUS), the initiative also contributed to more humanized healthcare approaches. Overall, the circles enhanced community awareness of mental health and integrative practices, empowering individuals to address challenges collectively.
";"Only about 25% of the vacancies offered were occupied by the participants due to challenges posed by the cultural stigma regarding mental health. The participants were also overwhelmingly women, which also demonstrates that men are also less likely to seek mental health care.
To sustain and expand the initiative’s impact, targeted outreach efforts should engage more men through community leaders and tailored messaging, while stronger institutional support could ensure long-term viability. Training additional facilitators and documenting the program’s long-term outcomes through research would further legitimize the practice, attract funding, and enable replication in other vulnerable communities.";"Integrative Community Therapy; mental health; Community Health; Integrative Health"

This type of study describes an innovative experience involving training that is widespread in the context of Brazilian nursing but still rare in Portugal. The focus of the experience is research, given that the training is part of a thesis project that aims to develop guidelines for training in auriculotherapy, based on WHO benchmarks. It should be noted that there are no guidelines with recommendations for writing experience reports; however, we chose to follow the assumptions for the preparation of experience reports as scientific knowledge proposed by Mussi, Flores, and Almeida. The experience took place at the Order of Nurses (OE) in Coimbra, Portugal, in January and February 2025, during academic mobility at the Coimbra Higher School of Nursing (ESEnfC). Informative and dialogical description was the type of analysis used, considering that this was an unprecedented training linked to a research stage.";The main document guiding acupuncture training is the WHO Benchmarks for the Training of Acupuncture, developed by the World Health Organization (WHO) with the collaboration of more than 50 global experts. This document defines training categories, content complexity levels, and a curriculum that integrates the fundamentals of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) with basic health disciplines. Of particular note is the recognition of the multidisciplinary nature of acupuncture, evidenced by the proposed curricular differentiation for biomedical professionals, practitioners of traditional medicine, and individuals without biomedical training. Auriculotherapy, a practice within the scope of acupuncture, can be learned independently through open courses, reinforcing its multidisciplinary nature. Nursing, whose practice is centered on care, can benefit from auriculotherapy as a tool that promotes professional autonomy. In Brazil, COFEN Resolution No. 739/2024 recognizes auriculotherapy as training via free courses, recommending a minimum of 80 hours, while defining acupuncture as a specialization with at least 360 hours of training. Auriculotherapy is performed by nurses in a significant way. Portugal does not develop training for nurses in auriculotherapy, but there is interest in this type of training, considering the trend toward a more complex care model. Thus, the experience of developing training in auriculotherapy for nurses working in Portugal was fundamental in fostering discussions that are still incipient in the country.;"The project received financial support from the Rio Grande do Sul State Research Support Foundation (FAPERGS) under grant number 04/2024, grant agreement number 24/2551-0001824-7, enabling the proposed training program to go ahead. This is a collective training program developed with nurses working in Portugal who have no previous training in auriculotherapy, these being the inclusion criteria. The class was composed of 19 nurses, intentionally invited by a professor from ESEnfC to participate in the training. Considering the learning objectives, the course was divided into six modules (five theoretical and one practical). The teaching materials used were adapted from the extension course promoted by the Extension Program #SUStentaPICS (School of Nursing and Collective Health - UFRGS); State Department of Health of RS (Technical Area of PICS) entitled “Professional qualification in PICS: auriculotherapy.” The course was adapted following the proposed guidelines for training nurses in auriculotherapy/auricular acupuncture. The course had an online theoretical stage, via UFRGS Moodle, and a practical stage in person at the OE in Coimbra, Portugal. The course was taught by two nurses with training in free auriculotherapy courses. The materials for the practical class were donated and delivered to the 19 nurses participating in the course. In the practical stage, the OE auditorium space was used. The tables and chairs were arranged in a circle to encourage constant dialogue among the nurses. Four days of practical classes were organized, according to the academic mobility period, on January 30, February 13, 20, and 27, from 1:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m., totaling 20 hours of practice. Due to health service availability, not all nurses were present on all days of practical classes, with a minimum of 5 hours required for certification. Thus, with the nurses who participated on February 13 and 20 (10 hours of practice), the training was based on biomedicine, reflexology, and TCM. For the group that participated only on February 27 (5 hours of practice), the approach focused on biomedicine and reflexology. As a teaching strategy for locating auricular points, a silicone ear model and pins were used, with location on the colleague's ear and through the use of an ear drawing and auricular map. Afterwards, a clinical case was presented to simulate auriculotherapy treatment, in which they had to locate the auricular points according to the school and branch studied and apply the points using seeds on their colleagues. The WhatsApp group was maintained, and discussions of cases, questions, and feedback frequently occur. Among the 19 students who completed the training, 13 reported applying auriculotherapy to friends, family members, and/or patients. The number of nurses using auriculotherapy can be understood as a positive aspect of the training. Patient safety, the adoption of evidence-based practices, and effectiveness in nursing care are expected results with improved professional training.";The experience has had an impact on the spread of auriculotherapy in Portugal, thus fostering new classes and new horizons with regard to its use as an intervention in nursing care.;"Complementary Therapies; Nursing; Integrative Medicine; Teaching; Education"

This practice was institutionalized by the National Policy on Integrative and Complementary Practices in Health (PICS) at the Brazil Ministry of Health (MS) in 2017. The Health Promotion and Social Cooperation Advisory (APSCS) of the Oswaldo Cruz Institute (IOC)/Fiocruz _Rio de Janeiro_RJ _Brazil, trains workers and students at levels (I, II, IIIA, and IIIB) in Reiki. After completing level IIIA training, the Reiki practitioner is capable of developing various practices relevant to this level, one of which is the sending of Reiki Energy to Planet Earth. Within this context, there exists a ""Gaia Theory,"" proposed by scientist and environmentalist James Lovelock and biologist Lynn Margulis, which posits that Earth functions as a living organism that self-regulates (https://www.sciencedirect.com/topic/earth-and-planetary-sciences/gaia-hypothesis). Thus, a group of Reiki practitioners was formed in alignment with this theory, considering our Planet Earth as a large living being to whom they send Reiki. This initiative arose during the COVID-19 pandemic with the aim of sending Universal Reiki Energies to assist in the balance of all living beings.
Objective: To send Universal Reiki Energy to Planet Earth.
Methodology: From August 2, 2021, to June 14, 2025, Reiki was sent to the planet with the participation of 15 practitioners at level IIIA. The sending frequency is daily, lasting 5 to 10 minutes, and its record is maintained on an internet platform (messaging application) and transcribed into a database (electronic spreadsheet). The sending occurs at non-specific times, at the discretion of the participant.
From the perspective of the Reiki participants, the practice of sending Universal Energies (Reiki) to Planet Earth contributes to the expansion of individual co-responsibility in a therapeutic approach aimed at the well-being of practitioners. Although our planet is considered a living being according to the ""Gaia Theory,"" which possesses favorable conditions for the emergence and maintenance of life, as well as the interconnection of all living beings, this study could not quantify the effect of transmitting Reiki Energy to Planet Earth due to the absence of appropriate technology for such measurement. In this regard, further research is necessary to elucidate these practices. However, reports from Reiki participants indicated activation of feelings of belonging, wholeness with Planet Earth, promoting strengthening and cohesion among living beings, the environment, and society. These effects align with literature highlighting Reiki as an integrative practice that promotes holistic health, reinforcing the personal development of practitioners. It also raises profound questions regarding resilience, revisiting important values for a more physically, emotionally, mentally, and spiritually balanced life, and primarily an integral perspective towards inhabitants and Gaia.
";This initiative originated during the COVID-19 pandemic to transmit Universal Reiki Energies to support the stabilization and harmony of all living entities on Earth. This practice is currently being implemented due to ongoing global crises, including conflicts, famine, and socio-political instability.;To date, a total of 3,820 participant engagements have been recorded, representing responses to 1,214 of the 1,414 scheduled transmissions, equating to approximately 85.85% of the days annually executed by Reiki practitioners. The remote transmission to Earth has elicited predominantly positive effects among participants, including enhanced well-being, increased sense of connection, stress reduction, and improved emotional and mental stability.The act of distant sending to Planet Earth has positively reverberated for the majority of participants, resulting in a sense of well-being and connection, reduced stress, and feelings of emotional and mental balance.;Reiki practitioners authorized to transmit this energy operate at varied times and locations, reflecting their diverse professional commitments within Fiocruz. The primary challenge is to quantitatively assess their activities and evaluate the impact of Reiki energy on environmental or planetary parameters with sufficient accuracy. Consequently, the development or adoption of more precise and suitable measurement instruments is necessary to reliably evaluate the intervention outcomes.;"Reiki; Integrative therapy; Spiritual; therapy; integrality"

As a municipal public servant, nursing technician, Usui Reiki therapist, humanized massage therapist, and undergraduate student in Integrative and Complementary Therapies.

The ""Seeds of Peace"" project grew from a careful and sensitive observation: the challenging and often exhausting routine of healthcare professionals in Vacaria. In our beloved city, in the heart of the Serra Gaúcha, the public health system pulsates intensely, and our colleagues, with their tireless dedication, daily face challenges that can weigh on both soul and body. The workload, dealing with the suffering of others, and the constant demand for excellence create a highly demanding scenario.

""Seeds of Peace"" served as a bridge: an invitation to self-care. News of the project spread like a gentle breeze, and participation was a testament to the latent need for a kinder self-regard.

The ""Seeds of Peace"" project was met with enthusiasm and gratitude. Sessions were held in a welcoming and peaceful environment within the health units themselves, offering a respite in participants' daily routines. To enhance relaxation, the atmosphere was enriched with aromatherapy , soft music therapy with relaxing melodies and tea therapy. The professionals served included administrative assistants, hygienists, oral health assistants, dentists, community health agents, nursing technicians, nurses, and doctors. Each session was conducted exclusively by me, allowing for a genuine and personalized connection with each colleague.";"""Seeds of Peace"" gently sought to touch the invisible wounds that the daily healthcare routine can leave. Our focus was to soften the burden of occupational stress, alleviate the fatigue that insists on settling in, and calm the exhaustion that consumes the bodies and souls of our professionals. Anxiety, sleepless nights, aches that lodge in the shoulders, and the dreaded burnout syndrome are realities that afflict those who give so much. The project extended an embrace of light, offering a tool for the release of these tensions, contributing to the flourishing of each employee's mental and physical health. It was a silent recognition, a gentle reminder that those who care also deserve to be cared for.";"With the implementation of the ""Seeds of Peace"" project, I observed in each session a decrease in anxiety, relief from physical pain, and, notably, a look of serenity and renewal after completion. At the end of each session, to further embrace and incorporate care, a chamomile or peppermint tea was served. These expected results were enhanced by combining complementary therapies, chosen for their recognized holistic benefits to physical and mental well-being:

Aromatherapy: Using a humidifier with essential oils, aromatherapy impacts the limbic system, influencing emotions and memories.

Lavender: Known for its calming properties, it helps reduce anxiety and promotes sleep.
Rosemary: Stimulating, it aids in relieving muscle aches, mental fatigue, and improves focus.
Lemongrass: With a fresh, citrusy aroma, it's energizing and contributes to stress reduction and mental clarity.
Music Therapy: Soft, relaxing melodies create an environment conducive to meditation and relaxation, calming both mind and body.

Chatherapy: The ritual of drinking a warm tea offers a moment of comfort and reinforces self-care.

Chamomile: Famous for its sedative and anti-inflammatory properties, ideal for reducing anxiety and inducing restorative sleep.
Peppermint: Refreshing and digestive, it contributes to mental clarity, aids in relieving nausea, and provides a sensation of lightness and overall well-being.
Together, these practices offer integrated care, promote self-care, and significantly contribute to the quality of life of healthcare professionals.";"In light of this deeply enriching experience, I wholeheartedly recommend that programs promoting well-being, with the sweetness and effectiveness of integrative therapies like Reiki, be embraced and cultivated in our healthcare environments. It is vital that municipal administrations open their eyes and hearts to the immense value of these practices in the occupational health of those on the front lines, dedicating resources and a space of affection for their continuous implementation. I dream of creating permanent peaceful corners in the units, where self-care can freely flourish. Furthermore, encouraging the training of more healthcare professionals in these therapies would be like planting more seeds, creating an internal network of mutual care and support. Documenting every small miracle of well-being, even the most subtle, is essential for this light to continue guiding new paths of care.

The ""Seeds of Peace"" project was received with enthusiasm and gratitude. The sessions were held in a welcoming and peaceful environment within the health units themselves, providing a respite in the daily routine of the participants. Each session was conducted exclusively by me, allowing for a genuine and personalized connection with each colleague. I could observe with each session a decrease in anxiety, relief from physical pain, and, most importantly, a look of serenity and renewal after completion.

Seeing the positive impact of Reiki on the lives of my colleagues, even if for a few minutes of relaxation, was extremely gratifying. Receiving their testimonials about improved sleep quality, reduced stress, and an overall sense of well-being reinforced the importance and effectiveness of integrative and complementary therapies in the workplace, especially in demanding areas like healthcare.

""Seeds of Peace"" was more than a project; it was an act of caring and recognition for these professionals who give so much of themselves. It proved that sowing small seeds of well-being can yield fruits of peace and balance in an environment that greatly needs it. I hope this initiative serves as an inspiration for more spaces and opportunities for self-care to be created in various sectors, because caring for those who care is fundamental for a healthier and happier society.

This practice was implemented in the public health system in the city of São João del-Rei in 2002, being expanded in 2008 with the creation of the Reference Center for Anthroposophic Medicine, in line with the guidelines of the National Policy for Integrative and Complementary Practices of the Ministry of Health ( Vieira, 2018).
";"We present anthroposophical-based group work and body care methods, based on anthroposophical principles. We emphasize the importance of care dedicated to people with severe psychic suffering, through fairy tale groups that supports individuals
stigmatized by psychiatric diagnoses (Vieira; Melo, 2024). In addition, we highlight physical activities for the elderly, applying the Neurofunctional Reorganization Method (Pereira, 2024), Cantotherapy groups (Rocha et al., 2022), therapeutic felting and an
expanded approach to anthroposophical medical care, including the production of anthroposophical medicinal formulas and external therapies, such as Threefoldness Therapy and geotherapy (Mühlenpfordt et al., 2022; Vieira, 2004; Vieira et al., 2022; Pugliesi; Guelman, 2017). The Anthroposophical Medicine Reference Center also hosts complementary practices such as Reiki, auriculotherapy and the Bioexpression group (Pereira, 2011). This space also serves as an training site for undergraduate medical students from the Federal University of São João del-Rei, as well as for extension and residency programs in Family and Community Medicine (Oliveira et al.,
2022; Vieira et al., 2022).
";In 2024, we provided a total of 6,371 consultations in the various services offered, as well as producing 9,362 anthroposophical medicines. Our work aims to achieve effective integration with the assisted community, recognizing the essential role of collaboration between families, the community and the environment. The support of volunteers is fundamental to strengthening and guaranteeing the quality and scope of our services, leading to a more participatory and responsible approach.;"
Although preliminary research has been carried out, there is still a significant gap in understanding of the care provided. Therefore, expanding the scope and depth of this research is essential to improve existing practices, guide public policies, and guarantee more humanized, effective care that addresses the actual needs of the population.

The practice was implemented in a primary care clinic that offers multidisciplinary care, including integrative and complementary practices (MTCIs). The initiative responds to the demand for expanding therapeutic options in the management of tobacco dependence, aligned with national health policies that recognize MTCIs. ;The experience was developed at Policlinic of Duque de Caxias, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. This region faces a high demand for services related to chronic diseases, including tobacco dependence, which remains a significant public health issue. In response to this demand, the healthcare unit offers a smoking cessation program that includes counseling, pharmacological support, and integrative practices, aligning with the Brazilian National Policy on Integrative and Complementary Practices (PNPIC). The integrative approach described in this report involved the introduction of homeopathy as a supportive therapy for individuals engaged in the smoking cessation program. The homeopathic treatment followed the principles of heteroisotherapy, utilizing individualized preparations based on the patient's own tobacco exposure. The intervention aimed to assist with reducing the desire to smoke, improving emotional well-being, and supporting the overall cessation process. This initiative was carried out by a multidisciplinary team, including pharmacists and other healthcare professionals trained in homeopathy and smoking cessation care. Throughout the process, participants received counseling sessions and guidance on the use of homeopathic medicines, contributing to a comprehensive, patient-centered approach.;The practical implementation demonstrated that the homeopathic intervention was well accepted by participants.  Many reported improvements in managing the desire to smoke, emotional regulation, and motivation to quit smoking. There were no reports of adverse effects related to the homeopathic treatment. Additionally, the incorporation of homeopathy was perceived by the healthcare team as an important enhancement to the quality of care, fostering a more holistic approach that aligns with the principles of integrative health. The Isomaker® device was used to extract smoke from each participant's cigarette of dependency as part of the individualised homeopathic intervention. Lactose tablets were made with the 6cH potency, and the extracted smoke solutions were dynamized in accordance with the Brazilian Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia. Patients who participate in the National Tobacco Control Program (PNCT) at Polyclinic received the medicines prepared by University of Pharmacy (Federal University of Rio de Janeiro) during the weekly meeting.;"The integration of homeopathy in public smoking cessation programs offers some lessons and recommendations: (a) Strengthening professional training in integrative practices is essential for successful implementation; (b) The need for service regarding the production and dispensing of homeopathic medicine at public primary healthcare unit. Further studies and systematic evaluations are recommended to better assess the effectiveness and sustainability of such interventions within public health.

These practices empower individuals and promote their protagonism in the healing process, working in conjunction with conventional treatments and offering an integrative approach to health.
Duque de Caxias, located 16 km from the capital of Rio de Janeiro, has a population of 808,161 inhabitants, according to the latest IBGE Census of 2022. The city is the second largest in the state of Rio de Janeiro in terms of economy and the third most populous (IBGE Census-2022)
The city continues to advance with investments in integrative practices, especially in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), such as the creation of the “Reference Center for Traditional Chinese Medicine and Integrative Practices”. This center not only provides access to therapies that were previously restricted to the elite, but also fosters a welcoming and caring environment where everyone can seek relief from their afflictions and improve their quality of life. A relevant aspect of this care is acupuncture, which has proven effective in providing emotional support to cancer patients. Studies indicate that acupuncture can reduce anxiety, improve emotional well-being and assist in pain management, offering a space for emotional support that complements conventional treatments.
We will also soon be opening the “Casa do Autista”, expanding our services to different segments of society and ensuring that more citizens have access to quality health services, where we will also be implementing the use of PICS.

Discussion: It is essential to recognize the importance of having managers who have a human and futuristic vision, valuing and understanding the relevance of PICS. Leadership that prioritizes the comprehensive health of the population not only transforms the way care is provided, but also establishes a management model that promotes inclusion and access to treatments that benefit everyone. Managers with this perspective understand that health is not limited to the absence of disease, but should encompass a state of physical, mental and social well-being, investing in practices that promote quality of life and prevention.
Conclusion: The inclusion of PICS in Duque de Caxias has proven to be essential to promote relief and well-being for the entire population of the municipality, contributing to a better quality of life for the population. This perspective of growth and continuous investment in integrative practices reflects the city's commitment to offering more humane, accessible and effective care to its population.

It is characterized by a set of health actions, at the individual and collective levels, which encompass health promotion and protection, disease prevention, diagnosis, treatment, rehabilitation, harm reduction and health maintenance, seeking to develop comprehensive health care (1).
Integrative and Complementary Health Practices (ICHP) in Primary Care were integrated to complement the care already provided, with the purpose of improving the quality and provision of health services, promoting alternatives for the sustainable development of communities and encouraging social participation and collaborative practices. By considering the individual in a holistic way, respecting their uniqueness, ICHP contribute to comprehensive health care, requiring interaction between actions and services in the SUS. Studies indicate that ICHP approaches promote greater co-responsibility of individuals for their health, favoring a broader exercise of citizenship(2). ICHP can be performed both individually and collectively, depending on the practice performed. It should be noted that ICHP is the term used in Brazil to refer to the practices of integrative and complementary medicine.
This paper aims to report the experience of implementing and maintaining a body practice group, Lian Gong, in a basic health unit in a city in the interior of São Paulo";"As a nurse in primary care, I provided care to people in all stages of the life cycle and with various health conditions, from acute cases to several chronic diseases. For users with chronic diseases, the unit offered some group follow-up, shared care and individual care options. In addition to medical and nursing consultations, there was also the offer of participation in body practice groups, Lian Gong, and in some cases, Auriculotherapy. Both practices were used to aid health treatment. In Primary Care, some groups are promoted for social, therapeutic and support purposes, with the aim of composing and improving the health care of the user. Some ICHP can be carried out in groups, which favors the dissemination of the practice, knowledge by the users and sharing of experiences with more people. As a nurse in a Family Health Strategy team, one way of contributing to the promotion, prevention and rehabilitation of the health of the users was to carry out the practice of Lian Gong in 18 therapies. This body practice of Chinese medicine promotes the prevention and treatment of musculoskeletal diseases and strengthens heart and lung functions. Carrying out this practice in a group allows the participants to take care of their health, as well as establish bonds and support networks, which help in the promotion and recovery of health. Lian Gong was offered twice a week, with a frequency of 12 to 25 participants, most of them women, with some chronic disease, such as high blood pressure, diabetes mellitus, depression, anxiety, osteoarthritis of the knees and spine, among other chronic diseases. 
Over the course of 19 years, the practice was offered continuously, maintaining the frequency of participants. It was noted that by attending these groups, people established a more effective and lasting bond with the team, as well as tended to practice their self-care.";;Some difficulties encountered were that not all of the team was familiar with the practice and could safely and confidently recommend this activity. In the unit, for many years, only one professional had the training to perform Lian Gong, so during vacation periods or leave, the group was suspended. As a nurse, there were also times when another nurse was absent, so I had to leave the group to prioritize individual care for the population, according to the demands of the day. We were able to minimize interruptions in the groups after training other professionals, who helped to maintain the activity. Another strategy to improve the team's dissemination and knowledge about the practice was to talk about the group in team meeting spaces and general meetings, when new professionals arrived, and to publicize the groups in other collective spaces for the team and the community.;"Primary Health Care; Complementary Therapies; Nursing"

This context contributes to high levels of stress, anxiety, and other mental health complaints, which compromise both the professionals’ quality of life and the quality of care provided (3), highlighting the urgent need for interventions that address both individual and collective well-being (2). Integrative and Complementary Health Practices (PICS) have proven effective in reducing these symptoms and promoting well-being (1,4). They support physical and emotional balance and are recommended by the Ministry of Health, despite their still incipient implementation in the SUS (1,5,6). The Therapeutic Moment project was developed in this context, aiming to promote health and emotional support for professionals in the “Better at Home” home care program, focusing on illness prevention and strengthening holistic care. ;"The project was launched in May 2023 and is still ongoing in a city in the interior of São Paulo. It was developed by health professionals from the “Better at Home” team, with institutional support, and scheduled during working hours to respect the team’s workload and service demands. Weekly 40-minute sessions included auriculotherapy, laser acupuncture, systemic laser therapy, and cupping therapy, conducted by two trained public servants. On average, 10 to 15 professionals participated per session, including nursing technicians, nurses, speech therapists, and physicians. Demographic data and main complaints were collected through spontaneous reports during the sessions and notes by the practitioners. Results:
Most participants were female (94%), aged between 28 and 58 years. Regarding race, 57% self-identified as White, 36% as Brown, and 7% as Black. The most frequent complaints included stress, anxiety, muscle pain, emotional exhaustion, and anguish. Post-session reports indicated significant improvements in relaxation, sleep quality, muscle tension relief, and work-related motivation.";The experience demonstrated that incorporating PICS into the institutional routine benefits both individual health and collective well-being, fostering a sense of belonging, bonding, and active listening among professionals. A relevant impact indicator was participants’ enthusiasm and active anticipation for the sessions. ;The experience demonstrated that incorporating PICS into the institutional routine benefits both individual health and collective well-being, fostering a sense of belonging, bonding, and active listening among professionals. A relevant impact indicator was participants’ enthusiasm and active anticipation for the sessions. Despite the positive outcomes, the project faced major challenges for its maintenance and expansion, such as limited financial and material resources, lack of time in professionals' schedules, and a shortage of trained practitioners. These barriers reveal the fragile structure of PICS within the SUS and the lack of prioritization for worker care. Therefore, the creation of public policies and institutional strategies is recommended to recognize and integrate these practices permanently in health services, as outlined by the National Policy on Integrative and Complementary Practices. Investing in the care of caregivers is essential for the sustainability of the health system and the quality of care delivered to the population.;"Worker health; Integrative Practices; Home care; health promotion"

Therefore, PHC plays an important role in the prevention of some Chronic Non-Communicable Diseases (CNCD) prevalent in the population, such as Diabetes Mellitus (DM).
We know that the Brazilian population values ??popular culture, especially knowledge of Medicinal Plants, and uses them to treat and prevent some diseases and illnesses, including DM. Medicinal plants have great pharmacological potential and are allies of the population. However, their incorrect use can cause health problems, drug interactions and even more serious toxic reactions.
The use of medicinal plants focused on healing is one of the oldest forms of treatment known to mankind. It is related to the beginning of medicine and pharmacy and is based on the accumulation of information passed down and improved from generation to generation. Over the centuries, medicinal plants have been the basis for the treatment of various diseases and prevention (1). Culture, the appreciation of popular knowledge, and the vast biodiversity justify the great demand and demand for medicinal plants in Brazil, where approximately 82% of the population uses preparations and products based on medicinal plants (2). Public policies and legislation related to medicinal plants and phytotherapeutics have advanced after the publication of Ordinance No. 971 of May 3, 2006 by the Ministry of Health, which instituted the  Decree No. 5,813 of June 22, 2006, which established the Medicinal Plants and Phytotherapeutics Policy (3,4). The objective of this work was to prepare educational material in the form of a folder on the safe use of medicinal plants in DM to be given to users with this chronic condition in individual and group care.
Three medicinal plants widely used for the treatment of DM were listed: garlic (Allium sativum), bitter melon (Momordica charantia) and pata de vaca (Bauhinia forficata or variegata). These three plants were chosen because they are easily accessible and widely known.";"
The decision to create a folder on medicinal plants was made after approaching the population of the Health Center, in individual and group care for users undergoing treatment for diabetes. Many of them associated some medicinal plant in addition to the prescribed medication and after concomitant use, they discontinued the allopathic medication because they believed it was “doing them harm”. Conventional treatment for DM is offered free of charge by the Unified Health System throughout the country. However, it is not always easy to manage pharmacotherapy and control, as this depends on numerous factors, such as: medication adherence (whether oral and/or subcutaneous, in the case of insulin), the availability of medications in the network and even the level of understanding of the patient and their family regarding ongoing treatment. However, we know that many patients seek other treatment options, including the elderly population.
We know that Brazil is a country with numerous cultures and traditions, and among them the use of Medicinal Plants stands out, and it is important to welcome and value this knowledge and practices, as it was often they that led science to discover new treatments and even cures through chemical compounds found in plants.";;"It is currently a great challenge to offer qualified care to the population, especially to DM sufferers who require multiple actions to control it, since it is a costly disease for the individual, the family and the SUS. The impacts on their lives are not only financial. However, the more decompensated the DM, the higher the direct costs of its treatment due to complications related to the disease, which can often be reduced, delayed and even avoided with proper treatment, giving sufferers better living conditions.
There are studies and scientific evidence that prove the efficacy and safety of using medicinal plants, including for DM. Therefore, we also know that potential interactions between allopathic medicines and plants can occur. It is important to highlight the importance of professionals being trained and familiar with the medicinal plants most used by the population in order to provide guidance on their safe use and also their risks, seeking to minimize drug interactions and contribute to the rational use of both plants and allopathic medicines, and contribute to adherence to DM treatment and the quality of life of these people.
The use of medicinal plants for therapeutic purposes without the supervision of a health professional results in a potential danger to the population. It is important that services offer their professionals training and guidance on the subject through ongoing education and health education for users. Perhaps our greatest challenge as health professionals today regarding the use of Medicinal Plants is this: to know, understand and not judge and distance patients from their traditions and beliefs.";"Primary Health Care; Medicinal plants; Diabetes Mellitus"

Homeopathic volunteers, qualified by their Professional Councils, provided homeopathic assistance and guidance to interested parties classified into four groups: Non-COVID, During COVID, Post-COVID and Vaccination. Homeopathic pharmacies supported the project by donating medicines or reducing costs. The main objective of this prospective study is to examine the administrative management and operational procedures, identifying successes and difficulties. The specific objectives are: (i) to analyze the profile of the project participants, considering data such as gender, age, occupation and region of residence; (ii) to identify the regions with the greatest number of homeopathic professionals; (iii) to identify the most accessible digital technologies; (iv) to develop a proposal for remote telecommunication in Homeopathy.";The lack of specific medications for the prevention or treatment of COVID-19 symptoms, the need for social distancing, as recommended by the World Health Organization, and the urgency of actions in the pandemic, motivated homeopathic professionals in the city of São Paulo to create a solidarity action, with the aim of minimizing illness and the worsening of symptoms due to COVID-19, through Homeopathy and enabling access to homeopathic medicine.;"Most of the participants in the Action were from the state of São Paulo. The project was managed by five pharmacists and one physiotherapist. Most of the patients treated were female, aged between 40 and 49, working in the health sector. The prescribing team was made up mostly of pharmacists, with qualifications and experience in Homeopathy. In just two months, the team managed to structure an action that reached 18 Federation Units, recruiting homeopathic volunteers, establishing partnerships with pharmacies to donate medicines or reduce costs, publicizing the social action, creating forms and operational procedures, and gathering support material. The use of smartphones and computers, and internet access proved efficient in serving those interested, through video or audio communication, using Whatsapp and Google Meet, and at low cost.

Based on a strong political will, and under the leadership of the Ministry of Public Health, one of the prioritized areas of work was the development of capacity building and training programs in the healthcare sector. During those years, a cross-curricular strategy was implemented for all undergraduate curricular programs of medical science careers. Also various postgraduate, diploma courses and master's degrees were developed. The Natural and Traditional Medicine specialty for medical doctors was introduced in 1995. Professionals from several countries supported Cuba in the initial stages of this process, drawing on their experiences and development in different areas such as acupuncture, homeopathy, and Bach flower therapy.;The Natural and Traditional Medicine curricular strategy is currently maintained at the undergraduate programs, but for the medical undergraduate students, it is also incorporated as an independent subject linked to the discipline of Family Medicine. Specialist training takes place at 12 medical science universities, eight of which have been certified of excellency by the national accreditation board. The country currently has 397 specialists and 198 residents. In addition, four universities offer master's programs in Natural and Traditional Medicine. Other medical specialties (Family Medicine, Gastroenterology, Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Pediatrics, etc.) integrate Natural and Traditional Medicine contents into their academic programs, and various postgraduate course options are maintained for continuous medical education.;"An analysis of the work developed in the past thirty years allows us to identify as the main lessons learned (1) the importance of political will for the development of Natural and Traditional Medicine; (2) the strength of having extended a national training strategy aimed at undergraduate and graduate students to facilitate learning of these therapeutic approaches; (3) the importance of international collaboration on relevant topics such as acupuncture (China, Vietnam, North Korea), homeopathy (Brazil, Argentina, Mexico), etc.; (4) the significance of the specialization program for doctors, its generalization to the majority of medical universities in the country and its academic strengthening; and (5) the link between medical education and medical care in the health services network for practical learning of Natural and Traditional Medicine. The main challenges currently from an educational point of view are related to (1) to continue strenghtening  the integration of Natural and Traditional Medicine in the different careers of medical sciences and postgraduate specialties; (2) to extend the specialization program for doctors to other medical universities and ensure its continuous improvement; (3) to expand master's programs at medical universities; (4) to develop a Cuban textbook that covers all thematic areas of the specialization program; and finally, (5) to strengthen international exchange with other universities and institues for the continuing medical education of our professionals.";In this way, the integration of Natural and Traditional Medicine within the Cuban National Health System is ensured through guaranteeing the ‘know’ and the ‘know how to do’ of its professionals.;"Natural and Traditional Medicine; Medical education; National Health System"

According to the World Health Organization (1) “autism often has an impact on education and employment opportunities. In addition, the demands on families providing care and support can be significant”. This is particularly critical in many low- and middle-income countries as Brazil, where the big social unbalance and the lack of public policies able to offer proper treatment and support, impose a sad reality to less fortunate atypical families. The 2013 version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5)(2), by the American Psychiatric Association, defines Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) as a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by “persistent deficits in social communication and interaction, as well as restricted, repetitive patterns of behaviour, interests, or activities”. Depending on their severity, these symptoms may affect people´s ability to function in school, work, and other areas of life. 
There isn’t a single medication that treats autism. Medications usually address comorbidities or other symptoms. Other interventions may include the use of cannabidiol, a massive number of hours per week of Behavioural Management Therapies, as ABA (Applied Behaviour Analysis) besides specific therapies according to the person needs which, generally, are not affordable for poor atypical families.
Therefore, having had a successful case with flower essence therapy of an autistic young man in the past, the author has started promoting the use of flower essences for this public until having the chance to evaluate this therapeutic modality with a larger sample.
Floral therapy has been developed by an English physician, Dr Edward Bach, in the earlier thirties of last century. It’s a person-centred therapeutic approach based on the use of natural products know as flower essences to balance negative emotional and/or mental estates, considered as the real causes of disease (3). Their unique concept, free of active chemical principles (4), allows their safe use by all ages as well as different administration possibilities. Since March 2018, floral therapy has been included in the Brazilian National Policy on Integrative and Complementary Practices (PNPIC) (5), which has prompted their offer at public health units and hospitals of different Brazilian cities. However, their use as a complementary intervention for people in the autism spectrum is still little available.";Floral Therapy doesn’t address what the person has but how the person reacts to what he/she has (3). Therefore, it can be useful to every area affected by autism spectrum disorder and/or other side symptoms. In addition, each flower essence may act in more than one affected area in a person with autism. As a consequence, in order to evaluate the service, questionnaires featuring common complains presented in people with autism have been developed.;Overall data of the evaluated items show a not at all percentage always smaller than or absent in relation to other options (very much, quite a bit, just a little). In other words, flower essences have helped to improve the items evaluated, albeit in different percentages and customized individual formulas. Some other issues tracked individually as: sleep disorders, food selectivity and urinary issues, have also shown significant improvements. In addition, parents report positive changes in one to less than a month period.;AAMPARA ´s public big rotativity per semester and/or year, poor instruction of most mothers and difficulty in adhering to the treatment are some of the factors that prevent us from having a more precise portrait of the service. However, data collected from the follow up questionnaire feature, at least, one return.;"Autism Spectrum Disorder; Autistic disorder; Flower Essences; Floral Therapy"

Based on the vitalist conception of health and illness also present in other therapeutic systems, it considers the existence of a channeled universal energy that acts on the balance of vital energy with the purpose of harmonizing the general conditions of the body and mind in an integral way. The therapy aims to strengthen the places where blockages are found - ""energy knots"" - eliminating toxins, balancing full cellular functioning, in order to reestablish the flow of vital energy. The practice promotes harmonization between the physical, mental and spiritual dimensions. It stimulates the energization of organs and energy centers. The practice of Reiki takes into account dimensions of consciousness, body and emotions, activates glands, organs, nervous, cardiac and immune systems, helps with stress, depression and anxiety, promotes the balance of vital energy and can be applied in person or remotely. This work presents the work of Sending Usui Reiki at a distance done by the Vijaya Rei Reiki Group through weekly online Meditation and Reiki sessions at a distance done by Reikians of the Vijaya Rei Group dedicated to education, awareness and integrative care aimed at Humans, Animals and the Planet that is part of the work of the Jarita Vijaya Institute (IJV). IJV is an organization that works as a social and popular clinic, providing education, assistance, support and shelter to all those in need. It arose from the personal journey of its founder, who delved into studies in Floral Therapy, Usui Reiki, Acupuncture and Integrative Practices and understood that it could help all those who are suffering, sick, afflicted, lost and without vitality. 9 years ago, she founded the Vijaya Rei Reiki Group, which meets weekly on Tuesdays, and since 2020 has promoted more than 230 open lectures addressing everyday topics with meditation and collective sending of reiki at a distance, reaching more than 62,000 people and animals who send their names and actively participate by being receptive to the sending.";Among the main complaints mentioned by those assisted by the program we have: Anxiety, Depression, Grief, Pain, Cancer, Surgical Process, Ageism, Relationship Breakups, Unemployment, Feeling of Emptiness, Loneliness, Suicidal Tendencies, Diseases and discomforts mentioned in Humans, Animals and expanding to the Planet addressing the concept of One Health where Humans, Animals and the Environment are interrelated. The open lectures aim to inform, provoke and encourage proactivity in their life processes, meditation leads to relaxation and Reiki aims to harmonize the physical, mental, emotional and spiritual, leading to self-awareness and the invitation to live Just for Today.;By promoting more than 230 different lectures on a variety of topics, our program has benefited more than 62,000 people and continues to be available on social media so that everyone can access the lecture content, guided meditation and remote Reiki. Participants mention relaxation, calmness, improved sleep, pain relief and clarity of thought, returning weekly to the proposed treatment and combining it with conventional treatment. Therefore, Reiki has been a positive intervention that helps promote well-being by fostering care, happiness and understanding of life cycles.;Reiki is a subtle, non-invasive integrative practice that can be applied to humans, animals and the environment in conjunction with conventional treatments.

It is a public service, completely free of charge, and is a comprehensive health support centre for young people aged 12 to 30 who live, study or work in the municipality of Cascais. This safe, accessible space dedicated exclusively to young people focuses on their emotional, psychological and physical well-being.
The S Space offers a welcoming, confidential and anonymous environment, and is recognised in the municipality as a ‘youth house’. The young people enrolled can benefit from interdisciplinary intervention in the areas of Psychology (in the form of individual psychotherapeutic support, pregnancy and maternity psychology and parenting support) and Nutrition (with a focus on food education and eating disorders).
At the time of writing, the technical team consists of 8 psychologists and 2 nutritionists. Given the significant need to complement its work, the S Space established a protocol with ‘A Barragem - Fundação Portuguesa para o Estudo, Prevenção e Tratamento das Dependências’ (The Dam - Portuguese Foundation for the Study, Prevention and Treatment of Addictions) for supervision in Clinical Psychology and for referrals to Psychiatry, Family and Couple Therapy and Addiction consultations. Referrals made to the Foundation are discussed monthly in intervision meetings with the technical teams from both services.
The fundamental importance of investing in promoting mental health in young people was also noted, which is why the Integration and Self-Discovery Programmes axis has been created. This programme includes conversation circles, known to young people as ‘Vitamin S’, and other modalities that are still being developed, such as life coaching, yoga, mindfulness and meditation.
Vitamin S is developed according to the methodology of Integrative Community Therapy, a group device born in the north-east of Brazil that aims to strengthen inter-community bonds and restore self-esteem. ICT follows rules of communication that establish a safe basis for sharing everyday concerns and coping strategies that empower and build resilience in the participants.
Currently, Integrative Community Therapy (ICT) is present in more than 40 countries across the Americas, Europe, and Africa. It is recognized by the World Health Organization (WHO) as one of the most promising social technologies for mental health care, the promotion of self-care, and the strengthening of community support networks.
The circles at the S Space take place every week on the same day and at the same time. Attendance at Vitamin S ranged from 3 to 9 participants, mostly female, in the 19 circles held up to the submission of this abstract. 
The TCI methodology is based on Paulo Freire's Pedagogy, which prioritises that problematisation must come from the participants themselves. For this reason, each circle asks who would like to bring their concerns, which gives the meeting a collective construction character. Once a month, however, a themed circle is held, in which Vitamin S's team of therapists suggests a theme that serves as an umbrella for the group's concerns. In February, for example, in celebration of Valentine's Day, there was a nurse specialising in community intervention who worked on the subject of sexuality, STD prevention and family planning.";Among the concerns shared in the open discussions were: anxiety about exams and school tests, difficulties socialising, inability to accept parental authority, frustration at not being able to overcome anorexia and mobile phone addiction. x;Among the concerns shared in the open discussions were: anxiety about exams and school tests, difficulties socialising, inability to accept parental authority, frustration at not being able to overcome anorexia and mobile phone addiction. Among the coping strategies, those considered most relevant by the girls include: acceptance, the ability to negotiate, the importance of parents as a source of tranquillity and security, recognising intuition as a resource for making decisions, reframing problems and letting them pass, looking at the stars and attending Vitamin S.;After 25 weeks of experience, the team decided to invest in artistic ressources to facilitate the emergency of the concerns. This is a path we recommend to projects directed to promoting mental health for youth.;"Youth; mental health promotion; Integrative Community Therapy"

Based on the holistic vision that integrates body, mind and spirit, the ZENCancer Institute recognizes that self-knowledge and awareness of life impermanence promote serenity and reinforce proactive coping with adversity.;"The Psychotherapy Center began in May 2020, motivated by the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and the growing need for therapeutic support for cancer patients. Social isolation, the interruption of in-person consultations, and uncertainty about treatment prognosis highlighted the increase of anxiety and depressive symptoms in this group. In response, the Center's coordinator Deborah Guimarães structured a 100% online model of individual and group psychotherapy, which could reach patients from different regions, without geographical barriers.
The project started offering weekly, individual Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) sessions, lasting 50 minutes, to each participant. Later, psychologist Elaine joined as a volunteer, and her experience in integrative oncology was fundamental to the development and coordination of the Cognitive-Behavioral Group Therapy (CBGT). Then, psychologist Soraia also joined the team and, together, we began to lead groups of 8 to 12 patients, with weekly 90-minute meetings for eight-week cycles. The approach is based on the principles of CBT, as postulated by Aaron T. Beck and Albert Ellis, which support the interrelationship between thoughts, emotions and behaviors. From this perspective, we work on identifying and restructuring dysfunctional automatic thoughts, emotional regulation through diaphragmatic breathing techniques and progressive relaxation exercises, as well as the practice of mindfulness to promote body and mental awareness. CBGT adds the collective support factor, allowing participants to validate their experiences and build a mutual support network. The adhesion process began with an initial screening, carried out through an electronic form and prior presentation, to assess the indication for individual or group care. Then, each patient participated in a standard psychological evaluation, which included the Anxiety Scale (BAI) and Depression Scale (BDI). These instruments allowed us to quantitatively monitor symptoms before the  therapeutic cycle, in the middle of the process and at the end of the eight weeks. During each CBGT session, the structure followed a script based on content presentation, discussion of home exercises, application of cognitive restructuring techniques and training of coping skills. Additionally, we incorporated psychoeducation on the neurobiological basis of stress and its impact on the immune response, which reinforced the participants' engagement and understanding of the importance of therapeutic practices. 
";"Preliminary results demonstrated an average reduction of 40% in anxiety scores and 35% in depression scores at the end of the cycle, in addition to a 30% improvement in reported fatigue. A significant reduction in sleep latency time and an increase in overall efficiency were also observed, indicating direct benefits in the physical and emotional dimensions.  
In addition to quantitative metrics, we captured the subjective experience. The reports emphasized three central dimensions: the value of the space for listening and sharing, strengthening the perception of belonging to a welcoming community, and increasing self-compassion. Many participants reported that group interaction was a decisive factor in overcoming stigma and emotional isolation, promoting bonding and empathy.
";"The challenges encountered included logistical issues, such as connection instability and adaptations of materials to the digital format. The diversity of technological familiarity among patients required individualized technical support in the first sessions. To overcome these barriers, we implemented individualized videoconferencing platform support.
The success of the Psychotherapy Center in the virtual environment reinforces the relevance of online modalities as a complementary strategy to in-person care, especially in contexts with restricted access. The model proposed by the ZENCancer Institute amplifies the reach of TCIM in a multidisciplinary context, and shows that, with good professional training and adequate infrastructure, it is possible to offer effective psychological support, even remotely, concurrently to TCIM.
Due to the positive results, we organized a collaborative project to produce a book that brings together the team's practical and scientific experience, including intervention protocols, illustrative cases, and implementation guidelines. This initiative aims to disseminate the knowledge acquired and encourage replicability in other health institutions.
In conclusion, this report demonstrates that the integration of TCIM with online CBT and TCIM constitutes a viable and effective approach for the comprehensive care of cancer patients. The findings indicate that evidence-based practices can promote well-being, acceptance, and resilience, contributing substantially to the mental health and quality of life of these individuals. Future longitudinal studies and randomized controlled trials may deepen the understanding and optimize intervention protocols.

Following the physical practices, participants engage in dialogue circles on various topics—suggested by the group members themselves—as well as meditation sessions. The group meets weekly, with each session lasting approximately two hours. At the end of each meeting, participant satisfaction is assessed using the Net Promoter Score (NPS), and self-reported perceptions of the practices’ impact on physical and mental health are also evaluated.;There has been a growing demand among SUS users for Integrative and Complementary Health Practices, as well as an increasing interest from Family Health Team professionals in adopting such practices to address common complaints encountered in individual consultations—such as insomnia, stress, anxiety, and chronic pain. This highlights the need for accessible, holistic care strategies that support physical and emotional well-being within the primary health care setting.;"The NPS score indicates that 95% of participants rated their satisfaction level as ""excellent"" regarding the practices offered. When evaluating mental health outcomes, 61% of participants reported perceived reductions in stress and anxiety, relief from mental tension, and an increased sense of relaxation. Regarding physical health, 32% reported perceived relief from chronic pain, greater energy levels, and improved body awareness.
Additionally, 100% of participants associated the impact on overall well-being with the fact that the group takes place in an open space, which facilitates contact with nature.";"Yoga and Tai Chi are low-cost, well-accepted tools for promoting physical and mental well-being. Offered in group settings through public health services, these practices democratize access to integrative care while also fostering social interaction and engagement with community spaces.
The findings demonstrate that offering Yoga, Tai Chi Pai Lin, and dialogue circles contributes to improved user well-being and effectively addresses the needs identified by Family Health Teams. This underscores the importance of integration with Multidisciplinary Teams. Expanding the availability of Integrative and Complementary Health Practices to other health care facilities within the SUS is recommended, considering their positive impact on users' quality of life.";"yoga; Thai Chi Pai Lin; Primary Healthcare ; Brazilian Unified Health System (SUS)"

Nurses and doctors are at high risk of professional burnout, which refers to the symptoms caused by chronic stress at work and include emotional exhaustion, depersonalization and decreased personal achievement at work. Mindfulness reduces symptoms of stress, depression and anxiety. In addition, mindfulness interventions have also been effective in reducing burnout symptoms, improving subjective health and resilience. Thus, mindfulness-based interventions for healthcare professionals, developed in the workplace, could contribute to promoting the health and well-being of these professionals. The aim is to report on the experience of developing a mindfulness implementation project for Portuguese health professionals. Eight mindfulness-based interventions were carried out for seven primary care health professionals in Portugal, in the city of Coimbra. The meetings took place once a week, collectively, led by a doctor of nursing who is trained in the practice. A team of researchers prepared a manual entitled “Promoting socio-emotional well-being based on the principles of mindfulness”, containing the collective and individual activities for the eight weeks. Every week, the participants experienced different mindfulness-based practices collectively, as well as receiving guidance on individual activities to be carried out on a daily basis. The meetings lasted an average of one hour a week and were held in a room available at the participants' workplace. The room was spacious and had air conditioning, mattresses, pillows and blankets for the participants' comfort. The interventions were carried out during the months of January and February 2025. In the first week before the intervention, questionnaires were administered on perceived stress and psychological well-being, which were reapplied after the eighth intervention. The perceived stress scale contains 13 items, each asking how the person felt in the month preceding the response. It is a 5-point Likert-type scale, ranging from 1 (never) to 5 (often). The overall score is the sum of the scores assigned to each item, with the highest score representing the greatest stress in the past month, and the maximum score is 52 points. The Psychological Well-Being Scale contains 18 items and reflects psychological functioning based on the following dimensions: self-control, personal development, life goals, positive relationships with others, environmental control, and autonomy. Each of the six scales/dimensions consists of three items specific to a specific measurement. It is a Likert scale with a 6-point response attribute. Scores range from 3 to 18, and the result for each scale is obtained by summing the items, after shifting the inverse items. Higher scores indicate higher levels of psychological well-being. The project was approved by the Health Ethics Committee No. 41/2023 and the participants signed a consent form.;The program developed for health professionals showed good adherence and all the participants took part in the collective activities proposed (only one participant's data was excluded because he was absent from three meetings due to family issues).;The results include the development of the program to guide the implementation of mindfulness-based interventions, the implementation of the eight weekly interventions and the results of the stress perception and psychological well-being scales applied before and after the eight meetings. Seven health professionals took part in the program, with an average age of 58. Five participants were female and two were male. The majority (n=5) were nurses, but psychologist (n=1) and social worker (n=1) took part. The participants had an average of 22.51 years' experience in their current area of work. All had a specialization degree and three had a master's degree. In relation to the perception of stress before and after the program, there was an average of 21.43 (SD=4.75) and 21.43 (SD=5.28) at both times, showing that there were no differences in this scale during the period investigated. With regard to the pre-program psychological well-being scale, there was an average total well-being of 82.71 (SD=14.47) rising to 84.86 (SD=13.29) post-program. For each dimension of the scale, the following values were observed, pre and post, respectively: Autonomy (13.86 with SD=3.38 maintaining 13.86 with SD=3.43), Environmental mastery (12.43 with SD=3.78 to 12.71 with SD=2.56), Personal growth (14 with SD=3.16 to 14.71 with SD=2.69), Positive relationships with others (13 with SD=2.94 to 13.86 with SD=2.26), Life goals (15 with SD=2.76 to 14.86 with SD=3.84) and Self-acceptance (14.57 with SD=3.86 to 14.88 with SD=3.38). There was no change in the perception of stress, but there was an increase in the average total well-being of the participants, indicating the possibility of a low-cost intervention for the care of health professionals in their workplace.;"The objective of the study was achieved. The implementation project was found to be feasible and could be implemented in other healthcare units in Coimbra. With qualified personnel to manage the project and a physical space for activities, it is considered a low-cost project that can contribute to improving the overall well-being of healthcare professionals in their work environment. One of the limitations of the study was the total number of participants; however, the program will be implemented in other health units and more data can be analyzed in the future.";"Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction; Health Personnel; mental health"

Within the spectrum of these practices, with the growing appreciation of comprehensive care and emotional well-being for health, flower therapy emerges as a gentle, deep, non-invasive therapeutic approach, with no known side effects and easy to apply, becoming an attractive alternative as a complementary therapy in health promotion.

This experience report describes the implementation of floral therapy at the Mandaqui Hospital Complex, located in the North Zone of São Paulo. Floral therapy was implemented at the CEPICS Clinic and School of Integrative and Complementary Health Practices, which is a space dedicated to welcoming and comprehensive care, acting as an environment focused on health and humanization amidst the busy routine of a large hospital. 

This report describes the obstacles, achievements and lessons learned during the process, with the aim of recording and evaluating the implementation experience and understanding its impact on the hospital environment.

Implementation began in April 2019 at CEPICS, a space provided by the hospital to the “Mandaqui Hospital Volunteers Association”.
This space is managed by a team of volunteers dedicated to promoting health through integrative and complementary practices.
Activities such as Reiki and Chromotherapy were already available, and the inclusion of floral therapy has further expanded the care options.

Services with Integrative and Complementary Health Practices (PICS) only occur when there is a medical referral.
Floral therapy has been harmoniously integrated with other practices already established at CEPICS, helping to strengthen a culture of care at the Mandaqui Hospital Complex.

The implementation is supported by a public-private partnership between CEPICS and the company Florais de Saint Germain, which is responsible for the therapeutic training of volunteers and the supply of floral essences.

IMPLEMENTATION OF FLOWER THERAPY OCCURRED IN FIVE MAIN PHASES

- Training and qualification of volunteers to work as floral therapists
- Promotion of floral therapy among teams of health professionals
- Raising awareness among hospital employees about self-care
- Structure for the storage and handling of floral essences
- Preparation of environments for floral therapy services

";"Initially, there was a lack of interest in the new therapy, mainly because health professionals were not familiar with the mechanism of action of flower therapy.

A publicity campaign was needed to inform the different sectors of health workers in the hospital about flower therapy.
After the announcement, we noticed a slight increase in the interest of health professionals in self-care, as they realized the opportunity to use flower therapy as a natural approach to promote health and well-being.

In March 2020, shortly before completing one year since the introduction of flower therapy at the Mandaqui Hospital Complex, the unexpected happened: the COVID-19 pandemic, which triggered an unprecedented crisis in the global health system.
Faced with this new reality, CEPICS volunteers had to completely modify their activities.

The care strategy focused on offering emotional support to health professionals, who were extremely overworked, making them the main beneficiaries of the PICS.

This change involved the creation of a proactive care model, taking support into the work sectors, with the delivery of bottles of flower essences based on the emotional vulnerability presented.

";"In a context of high vulnerability and stress caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, CEPICS has become a reference point for offering emotional and mental support to healthcare professionals, who, out of necessity, began to use flower therapy and become familiar with it.

With the increased use of flower therapy and the favorable perception of its results, the recommendation of this therapy and the request for care by healthcare professionals grew exponentially.

In 2019, the average number of flower essences delivered to patients was 1.164 bottles per year.

Since the beginning of the pandemic in 2020, a special formula was developed to meet the demands of healthcare professionals, which resulted in a considerable increase in demand. 2.535 bottles of flower essences were distributed to employees this year.

The growth trend continued, and until 2024, the annual average of flower essences delivered reached 5,000 bottles, consolidating the positive impact of this therapy in the hospital environment.
";"For new PICS implementations in any health complex or structure, it is recommended that in the first four months the focus of care be directed to health professionals who work in that location and who are interested or curious about the therapies offered, so that they can try the therapies and, mainly, recommend them to patients based on their personal experience.

Healthcare professionals often experience considerable psychological distress and burnout, leading to higher rates of absenteeism compared to other professions, highlighting the critical need for interventions that promote their well-being (Cohen et al., 2023).
This report is based on the growing demand for integrative strategies that aim to improve the mental and emotional well-being of patients and health professionals.

Interventions that aim to reduce burnout and improve mental health are crucial investments in the health workforce, which is the greatest asset of any health system (Hallam et al., 2024).

One of its main objectives is to provide free and voluntary care to cancer patients through Traditional, Complementary, and Integrative Medicine (TCIM). The Body&Art project emerged from the interaction between two of the Institute's Activity Centers — Art Therapy and Restorative Yoga — in order to contribute to the well-being of the cancer community by promoting activities primarily outdoors and in contact with nature. The first meeting took place in May 2023, and 10 meetings were held in Rio de Janeiro until July 2025.
Activities are developed in annual thematic cycles, with the guiding themes being ""Cycles and Seasons"" in 2023, ""The Meanings of Life"" in 2024, and ""The Goddesses of the Soul"" in 2025. Meetings are bimonthly, taking place on Saturday mornings and lasting approximately three hours. Twelve places are available per meeting, and registrations are accepted in the  event week. During this period, 34 people registered with ZENcancer have already participated in the project, which has had an average of nine participants per meeting, all women who have undergone or are currently undergoing cancer treatment. Participants are welcomed to the event with a communal snack, followed by a theme presentation, a body-based approach, an art therapy activity, and a closing discussion and integration circle. Various therapeutic tools, such as movement, meditation, relaxation, yoga, dance and other expressive and playful activities through the body and the plastic language of Art Therapy are used as mediators in the process of self-knowledge and well-being.
";"Stress, anxiety, fear, isolation, low self-esteem, and difficulty expressing their emotions are challenges reported by patients during cancer treatment. Participants frequently highlight issues related to communication and acceptance in their family, social, and professional relationships.
Throughout the Body&Art program, the proposed activities provide a space for free expression where emotions, the organization of thoughts, and diverse sensations are welcomed and expressed during the sessions. In a group, each participant, within their capabilities, has the opportunity to perceive their body and emotions, process their pain, and express their creative potential in a playful way, giving flow to the meaning of existence and strengthening their awareness and self-esteem, which aids in the treatment as a whole.
“We know the importance of restoring perception and awareness of vital aspects in life's journey, such as breathing, heartbeat, body movements associated with physical well-being, the quality of thoughts, emotions, spirituality and human creativity in achieving its fullness” (ALVES, 1995).
";"Analyzing the registrations and attendance lists for the Body&Art project in 2023, we noted that 7 of the 10 women who participated in the first meeting remain regulars, having attended at least 6 meetings. We also noted that of a total of 34 participants, 14 attended at least 2 meetings. We realized that this data demonstrates excellent engagement with the project, especially given the highly diverse group, with a wide range of ages and treatment stages. We observed that a group of women naturally formed who embraced the project and strived to attend the meetings whenever possible, which became increasingly enriching and profound.
Based on the verbal testimonies at the end of the meetings, we understand that the activities foster moments of positive emotions, generating enthusiasm, clarity, relief, and the unblocking of denser energies, allowing emotions to be expressed and reinterpreted. These accounts, as well as the visual recordings, portray feelings of unity, complicity, quality listening, harmony, and hope. The integration of artistic activity with body awareness enhances the therapeutic sensation and enriches quality of life, helping participants experience the challenges present in any phase of cancer treatment more easily and calmly, feeling welcomed and welcoming to one another.
";"Ensuring that all available spaces are filled and that more people can participate in the project is a major challenge, as we observe many cancellations due to scheduling conflicts or absences due to treatment side effects, which is perfectly understandable in the oncology context. Creating a waiting list and confirming the day before was a solution we found to realign vacancies and activities. Other challenges we currently encounter are related to the desire to implement systematic and ongoing work with regular participants, as well as the systematization of testimonial records.
For similar projects, we recommend expanding the choice of location, considering that the quality of the experience surrounded by nature is always more enriching and that the collective has its own unique characteristics. We also emphasize that these listening and sharing spaces need to be protected, qualified, and also need to be continuously monitored, encouraged, and strengthened.

In the context of Integrative and Complementary Health Practices (PICS), both medicinal plants and Ayurveda share similarities and key points that contribute to health care. The objective of this work is to encourage autonomy and the exchange of knowledge about PICS, with a focus on health promotion. The aim is to integrate the ancient Indian tradition with Brazilian popular knowledge, training therapists in a reflective and comprehensive manner. The initiative also seeks to simplify access to these practices and expand cultural exchange between Brazil and India. Two editions of the project have already been carried out, with exchanges of knowledge between Ayurveda and Brazilian medicinal plants. The first took place at Horto e Terrapia, and the second at Fórum Itaboraí – Fiocruz Petrópolis, where workshops on preparing health products were held: the workshop on medicated ginger oil through Ayurveda and the workshop on mulungu tincture through the popular culture of medicinal plants. These experiences strengthened the internal collaboration between Horto Fiocruz, Terrapia, Horto-Escola Fiocruz Petrópolis and Rede Fito, in addition to intensifying relations with Ayurveda, facilitated by Escola Yoga Brahma Vidyalaya. This institution contributed to the cooperation with Ayurveda doctors, who visit Brazil to share their knowledge, enriching the training of therapists from Fiocruz and its partners. The experience led to the production of a video and other materials under development.";The motivation stemmed from understanding the use of medicinal plants, aligning the PICS through knowledge of different practices that enabled the exchange of knowledge on some new aspects established and used within the countries' cultures and in Ayurveda research, enhancing the training of therapists. Some discrepancies arose in the understanding of herbs with popular names due to their pronunciation in Portuguese, but the species names resolved these issues. Interestingly, the biggest issue was the case of a type of herb considered invasive in Brazil and in Ayurveda, widely used for the treatment of liver diseases, spleen malfunction, skin conditions including cancer, kidney stones, and arthritis, causing surprise among experts and participants.;"The first edition had 22 participants, reinforced by another 20 in the second, including PICS therapists from various Fiocruz units, professionals and therapists from the Yoga Brahma Vidyalaya School, and health agents from the Três Rios Municipal Health System. They described it as a crucial moment to better understand the plants, their uses, and the therapeutic potential of these practices, facilitated by the experiences and exchange of knowledge in the Horto and the Sensitive Garden. They considered the proposed activities in the workshops on preparing Mulungu tincture and preparing medicated ginger oil to be innovative, enabling them to be applied in the practices of the participants, therapists in training, generating great interest and future partnerships. These meetings aim to broaden and diversify the perspectives on care and Health Promotion in Complementary and Integrative Health Practices (PICS), reverberating the scientific knowledge of the practices of medical rationality originating in India and the paths of traditional medicine of medicinal plants from indigenous, quilombola, farmer, and native peoples of Brazil.
Strengthening International Collaboration, production of educational materials, article (in progress) and video produced are significant results.";Experience shows that an interesting topic can convey meaning, evolving into constructive and collaborative learning. Regarding organization, each stage should involve those responsible for its tasks and demands. Communication tools (visitor registration form, invitation and presentation of the purpose of the activities, attendance lists, etc.) were used to request infrastructure resources and schedules from participants, guests, and institutions involved. Venue reservations, transportation, food, and logistical support must be met, without losing the common purpose of advancing and building intra- and inter-institutional bridges, in this specific case, bringing together international cooperation and scientific and cultural knowledge on medicinal plants of native species of Brazilian flora. The greatest lesson learned is identifying opportunities and partnerships with shared interests and, thus, organizing as a thematic network, which are crucial for success.;"ayurveda; Plantas medicinais; Ensino; PICS"

The use of culinary practices in therapeutic contexts has been recognized in the literature as an effective complementary tool in managing chronic diseases, including obesity. Strategies such as cooking workshops, teaching kitchen programs, and meal preparation practices have shown benefits in modifying eating behavior and strengthening the relationship with food.
This report aims to describe the experience of using an Experimental Kitchen as a complementary tool in the treatment of obesity during hospitalization in a specialized hospital, highlighting its potential to promote food autonomy, sustainability, and engagement in the self-care process.
This is an experience report, approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the State University of Bahia (UNEB), CAAE: 65578822.1.0000.0057, describing the use of an Experimental Kitchen as an integrative approach in the hospital treatment of obesity. The intervention was carried out between 2020 and 2022 in a hospital unit specialized in the multidisciplinary care of severe obesity.
The sessions were held weekly, lasting 60 minutes, led by nutritionists, psychologists, and occupational therapists, with active participation from the patients. The practical classes took place in an experimental kitchen, using recipes based on functional foods, regional ingredients, and low-cost, easy-to-prepare dishes. The sessions also served as spaces for sharing experiences, encouraging reflection on eating habits, meal planning, and self-care strategies for the post-hospitalization period.
Some of the recipes taught included pumpkin vatapá, functional granola, green banana biomass and cocoa dessert, gluten-free nut bread, regional fruit sorbet, and healthy preparations for São João festivities.";"The integration of the Experimental Kitchen into the hospital setting aimed to address several challenges in the care of patients with obesity:
Development of healthy recipes aligned with the therapeutic goals of a hypocaloric diet, while respecting cultural, regional, and emotional food traditions. The preparations used everyday ingredients with functional properties and encouraged mindful consumption by teaching about local agriculture.
Encouragement of the consumption of foods not typically present in the patients' routines, focusing on lifestyle changes.
Support in overcoming behavioral and emotional resistance related to adopting new eating patterns, including the incorporation of healthy habits within the family environment.";"Hospitalized patients undergoing obesity treatment participated in the activity, organized according to their hospitalization period. The sessions were thematic and covered a range of topics, from the use of kitchen utensils and household measurements to culinary techniques and recipe development, including food tasting. Concepts of mindful eating were also introduced, and the applicability of the techniques learned to the patients’ dietary routines after hospital discharge was discussed.
The involvement of the multidisciplinary team enriched the exchange of experiences and fostered a broader approach to healthy eating in the context of obesity care.

";"The implementation of an Experimental Kitchen in hospital settings focused on obesity treatment can be recommended as a relevant integrative tool. The interdisciplinary nature of the sessions proved essential for enhancing learning and expanding the perspective on lifestyle change among patients.
Challenges included providing support to overcome behavioral and emotional resistance to new dietary patterns and incorporating regional and sustainable foods that resonate with the patients’ cultural background during and after hospitalization.
This experience reinforces the potential of the Experimental Kitchen as a complementary integrative practice in the treatment of obesity and in promoting food autonomy.";"obesity; hospitalization; culinary education"

The “Integrated Health Experience” is an educational workshop designed in 2022 by naturologist Fernanda Scheffer Augusto da Rocha. It aims to approach health from a broadened, accessible, and experiential perspective, strengthening health, preventing disease, and fostering health education through a simple and effective theory-practice activity, based on accessible self-care practices. The workshop was held in community spaces, health centers, and schools in the territory, and it expands the concept of health across physical, metabolic, vital, emotional, mental, and supramental dimensions. Aligned with Farol’s model — founded on Salutogenic, Vitalistic, Integrative Health, and Social Production of Health perspectives — it stimulates community empowerment, autonomy in care, and a positive social impact. Between 2024 and 2025, 15 workshops were held with 249 participants and a 99.5% satisfaction rate, reflecting impacts on the participants’ well-being, network strengthening, and adherence to self-care. The experience highlights the importance of integrating integrative practices into the health system and community spaces, demonstrating high replicability and potential for social transformation.
Contextualization:
 The “Integrated Health Experience” is an educational workshop offered by Farol to promote health and community strengthening in peripheral neighborhoods of São Paulo. It was implemented in spaces such as SASF Capão Redondo, UBS Lídia, UBS Maracá, Vida Corrida, Tia Edna’s Association, and EMEF José Lins do Rego. The methodology derives from the “Workshop for Multidimensional Self-Care for Teachers” designed by Fernanda Scheffer in 2022, aiming at an accessible, broadened, and experiential view of health.
 The proposal aims to activate health in people, promote well-being, prevent disease, and strengthen education in integrative health, using a simple and effective theoretical-practical methodology. It expands understanding and practices of self-care based on physical, vital, metabolic, emotional, mental, and supramental dimensions, through a participatory approach.
The workshop was designed in a sequence that combines vivencial, transdisciplinary, and popular education methods, anchored in Naturology, Integrative Health, community practices, and the Quantum Model of Health (Bignardi, UNIFESP), and popular health education. The procedure includes: (1) reception and sensorineural ambiance; (2) Farol’s presentation; (3) string dynamic to introduce health as a social network; (4) exploration of health dimensions through practices (self-massage, tasting, breathing, meditation, and gratitude); (5) closing and sharing. Activities were simple, applicable to daily life, and meant to empower participants and their communities.
Theoretical Framework:
 The Integrated Health Experience, designed by naturologist Fernanda Scheffer Augusto da Rocha in 2022, was conceived to address health from a broadened, accessible, and experiential perspective. The proposal aims to activate health, promote well-being, prevent disease, and strengthen education in integrative health through a simple and effective theory-practice activity, based on accessible self-care practices. It is founded on a combination of knowledge that collectively promote a broadened understanding of health as a state of balance across physical, vital, mental, emotional, supramental, and spiritual dimensions. The theoretical bases include Amit Goswami’s Quantum Model, which sees consciousness as the basis of reality; the Transdisciplinary Medicine Protocol (Bignardi & Ramos, UNIFESP), which guides care from a multidimensional and integral view; Freire’s pedagogy, which values protagonism, knowledge exchange, and collective development; Ayurvedic Medicine’s biotypology and view of the five elements; and Rudolf Steiner’s Anthroposophy, which considers physical, etheric, astral, and spiritual bodies and utilizes practices like meditation (Tratak) to promote balance, vitality, and clarity of mind.";The “Integrated Health Experience” was developed to address the limited access to health promotion and integrative care in peripheral territories of São Paulo, particularly in communities like Capão Redondo and Campo Limpo. These areas face significant social vulnerabilities, including reduced access to quality healthcare, low availability of educational initiatives focused on self-care, and weakened community networks. The conventional health model often overlooks multidimensional health approaches and fails to promote autonomy and empowerment among individuals. Additionally, the gap between the formal healthcare system and integrative practices creates barriers to accessing affordable and preventive care. This experience seeks to bridge this gap by offering a low-cost, replicable, and community-centered approach that strengthens social bonds, promotes multidimensional health, and empowers individuals to become active participants in their own care.;" Between 2024 and 2025, 15 workshops were held, offering 308 seats; 249 people participated, and 261 evaluations were collected. The average NPS was 92.3% and satisfaction 99.5%. Participants valued the welcoming approach, applicability, and effects, noting well-being, relaxation, self-awareness, and strengthening of social networks. The most preferred practices were self-massage, breathing, meditation, the “string dynamic”, and tasting. The methodology demonstrated strong engagement and replicability in community and educational settings.";"The “Integrated Health Experience” workshop achieved a 99.5% satisfaction rate and a 92.3% NPS, demonstrating strong impact on well-being, self-awareness, and social connection. Its accessible, experiential approach empowers participants through simple, multidimensional self-care practices. To scale this impact, the initiative should expand to underserved areas, ensuring sessions of 1.5–2 hours in welcoming spaces. Training local facilitators and providing educational materials will support replication. Integration into public health strategies, particularly within SUS, can broaden access to integrative care. Its low-cost model and alignment with WHO guidelines make it a valuable tool for promoting equity and community health.

Committed to promoting holistic health and social transformation, the Institute developed a pedagogical model that integrates technical training with supervised practice in public and institutional spaces.

In response to the challenges of consolidating Traditional and Complementary Medicine (TCM) in Brazil’s Unified Health System (SUS)—such as the shortage of trained professionals and limited public access to these practices—the Institute created a pathway that connects education, service, and community impact. Its training model is based on three key dimensions: hands-on learning of over 28 techniques; development of human and ethical competencies such as empathy, active listening, and presence; and professional tools including anatomy, entrepreneurship, and communication.

Through strategic partnerships with government bodies such as the Ministry of Health and the Department of Education of the Federal District, as well as through public events and community initiatives, students engage in real-life therapeutic experiences. These include actions like monthly open clinics, wellness programs in schools, and health interventions for civil servants. All sessions are supervised by experienced facilitators to ensure safety, quality, and professional growth.

In 2024 alone, more than 500 free treatments were delivered, generating positive institutional feedback and expanding recognition of integrative care. The experience shows that by embedding practice within education, it is possible to form skilled, ethical, and socially conscious therapists—strengthening the presence of TCM in the public health system and contributing to inclusive, human-centered, and sustainable care.";One of the main challenges faced in integrating Traditional, Complementary, and Integrative Medicine (TCIM) into public healthcare in Brazil is the lack of qualified professionals and public awareness. Many communities, especially those in vulnerable situations, have limited access to TCIM services due to geographic, institutional, or informational barriers. Additionally, educational programs often emphasize technical content without offering real-life application in public contexts. This limits students’ ability to apply their knowledge in diverse social realities and weakens the presence of TCIM in government health policies and practices.;In 2024 alone, over 500 free therapeutic sessions were provided by students in supervised settings. The initiative has reached a wide variety of people—including civil servants, teachers, children, and older adults—with high satisfaction reported by participants. Partner institutions such as the Ministry of Health and the Department of Education in the Federal District have expressed interest in expanding collaboration. Students have shown significant growth not only in practical skills but also in ethical maturity, self-confidence, and community commitment.;"To improve and expand similar initiatives, we recommend:

	•	Strengthening partnerships with public institutions through formal agreements.
	•	Offering continuous pedagogical training for facilitators involved in field supervision.
	•	Establishing clearer policies for logistical support, including transportation and infrastructure for mobile care units.
	•	Creating awareness campaigns about TCIM in public spaces to increase population engagement.
	•	Replicating the model in other regions through aligned educational institutions and public health stakeholders.

Despite logistical and institutional coordination challenges, the model has shown high potential for scalability and policy integration.";"Complementary Therapies; Health Education; Public Health Services; ayurveda; Massage therapy"

This regional context reflects Brazil's urban challenges, where women often face socioeconomic pressures exacerbated by familial and cultural dynamics. The methodology follows Bert Hellinger's systemic-phenomenological approach, using tools like symbolic figures, systemic questions, and metaphorical cards. The focus is on women experiencing recurrent emotional suffering, relationship difficulties, and financial blockages—common issues in this demographic.
The primary objective is to help participants reframe their life narratives within family systems, identifying unconscious loyalties, interrupted bonds, and hidden patterns affecting their emotional health, financial stability, and relationships. Clients reported significant improvements in emotional regulation, decision-making clarity, healthier boundaries, and resolution of long-standing personal/financial challenges.
The online Family Constellation groups began during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, following the systemic–phenomenological model developed by Bert Hellinger. Each group consists of up to 10 participants, with a primary focus on women, and runs for 10 weekly sessions (approximately three months), always on the same day. More than one group runs each week, with each meeting lasting two hours.
Sessions follow a structured sequence: (1) a check-in round for participants to share how they are arriving emotionally, fostering awareness of feelings; (2) a 30-minute workshop on predetermined themes (e.g., “What is Family Constellation,” “Orders of Love/Helping,” “Relationships with Mother/Father,” “Ancestry,” “Inner Child,” “Prosperity”); (3) a short centering exercise; and (4) the constellation itself, using the water field technique and participants as representatives. The constellation begins with the constellated person and the theme, progressively adding family system representatives until the source of tension emerges. This is often revealed by strong emotions such as tears, anger, or rejection. Awareness is facilitated through symbolic repositioning and reframing statements, ending when the field becomes lighter and tension dissipates. A brief systemic exercise closes the session.
Between 2020 and 2024, approximately 60 women participated, each attending between 1 and 10 constellations. Feedback is collected through spontaneous participant reports, follow-up conversations, and qualitative testimonials. Examples include";Many women between 35 and 65 years old sought Family Constellation therapy due to emotional suffering linked to unresolved family conflicts, financial instability, and transgenerational patterns. Among participants, 70% were married, while 30% were single and without children. Women over 55 were predominantly married or divorced mothers, with 80% of divorced participants coming from families where parental divorce had recurred across generations. These women reported feeling overwhelmed by repetitive cycles in relationships (especially romantic and financial ones), low self-esteem, and difficulties breaking free from inherited patterns of abandonment or scarcity. Common challenges included emotional dependence, inability to set boundaries, chronic anxiety, and financial blockages tied to unconscious family loyalties. Older participants (55+) often faced additional struggles with life transitions, such as empty nest syndrome or late divorces, while middle-aged women grappled with identity reconstruction beyond marital roles.;"Participants reported significant improvements in emotional regulation (e.g., reduction in anxiety symptoms), greater clarity in decision-making, and the establishment of healthier interpersonal boundaries (especially in marital relationships). The process facilitated the release of unconscious family loyalties linked to transgenerational patterns (particularly among divorced women from families with a history of divorce), fostering reconnection with inner resilience. Positive outcomes extended to relational dynamics (80% of married participants reported improved conflict resolution) and financial behaviors (a 50% reduction in scarcity mindset, with cases of reentry into the labor market and resolution of financial issues). The intervention consistently promoted empowerment, with clients describing renewed autonomy and a strengthened sense of belonging. Participant feedback is collected through spontaneous reports, follow-up conversations, and qualitative testimonials. Below are some examples that illustrate common results: 
Silvia (2024): ""I had depression and burnout syndrome; I suffered a lot, lost my job, and had to resign, which caused me even more suffering. I used to take medication to sleep and just to be able to get out of bed, and I was always very nervous and irritable. In 2020, a friend introduced me to Family Constellation, which helped me a lot. This allowed me to calm down and see myself more clearly. Today, I no longer take any medication, I sleep very well, and I can do things without fear. I am grateful to my friend who introduced me to Family Constellation and to Edna, who is my constellator and a wonderful person. Gratitude.” 
Anonymous participant (2023): Described releasing repressed emotions, redefining self-worth, and healing deep, long-standing wounds. She now embraces self-care and self-love, feeling lighter, more confident, and happier.
Lilian (2022): Before constellations, suffered from debilitating headaches lasting weeks, unresponsive to medical treatment. Since starting sessions, she reports complete remission of these chronic headaches.

";Family Constellation has proven to be an effective and accessible complementary approach to emotional and mental health care, particularly for women. Although it is officially recognized by the Brazilian Unified Health System (SUS) as part of its Integrative and Complementary Practices (PICS), challenges remain due to limited understanding among health professionals and persistent prejudice in institutional settings.  In December 2024, the Brazilian Academic Consortium on Integrative Health (CABSIN), in collaboration with BIREME/PAHO, published the first Evidence Map on the clinical effectiveness of Family Constellation. This initiative aimed to consolidate available scientific knowledge and guide public policies and professional practices. The analysis included 16 studies, with 40 health outcomes assessed. Of these, 75% showed potentially positive results for mental health, 15% had confirmed positive effects, and only 10% remained inconclusive. These results reinforce the importance of advancing research while acknowledging the existing impact of Family Constellation as a therapeutic resource. Therefore, it is recommended that Family Constellation be further integrated into comprehensive mental health strategies, especially to support women facing emotional overload, affective suffering, relational difficulties, and transgenerational financial blockages. Public institutions and mental health services should encourage evidence-informed training, reducing stigma and expanding access to practices that support self-care, autonomy, and emotional resilience among vulnerable populations.;"Family Constellation; Women’s Health; Emotional Healing; Systemic Therapy; Integrative Health"

Since 2020, weekly sessions of Restorative Yoga, Meditation and guided relaxation have been adapted to hospital routines and delivered in various settings, including auditoriums, chemotherapy rooms, patient bedsides, standard rooms with chairs and spaces prepared with yoga mats. Sessions last between 25 and 60 minutes and integrate gentle joint mobilization, self-massage and deep guided relaxation focused on conscious breathing, mindfulness and emotional self-regulation. A specific protocol, RestauraZEN, developed from years of hospital-based experience, ensures safety and methodological consistency. More than 140 sessions are conducted annually, benefiting an estimated 1,100 to 1,400 participants per year, including healthcare professionals, patients and caregivers. All facilitators undergo comprehensive theoretical and practical training that combines technical skill, ethics and sensitivity to the hospital environment.;Hospital settings, especially in oncology care, expose both professionals and patients to chronic stress, emotional overload and physical exhaustion, often without access to structured, non-pharmacological strategies for self-regulation or relief. Healthcare teams face long shifts with limited opportunities for pause, while patients and caregivers experience anxiety and vulnerability in high-pressure environments. The intervention was designed to fill this gap by integrating safe, accessible and evidence-informed wellness practices into hospital routines, fostering emotional stability and physical recovery. A major challenge in implementation was institutional hesitation to allow external, volunteer-led programs in sensitive clinical contexts. Building trust required the creation of a rigorous protocol aligned with hospital standards, formal training for facilitators, and continuous evaluation to demonstrate safety, efficacy and relevance for the hospital community.;"Over five years of continuous implementation, the initiative has demonstrated consistent and measurable impact. More than 140 annual sessions, averaging 7–10 participants each, provide over 1,000 individuals per year with direct access to guided relaxation and emotional regulation techniques. Post-session evaluations conducted with healthcare workers in 2025 revealed that 100% reported improved well-being and greater emotional balance immediately after practice, with many highlighting better focus and resilience during work. Qualitative feedback underscores these results: “My life is divided into before and after these practices”; “I learned to control a panic attack with the breathing techniques”; “Just a few minutes completely change my day.” Patients frequently report decreased pain, better sleep and a sense of lightness and calm, while caregivers describe moments of presence and reconnection amid ongoing stress. These outcomes indicate that even brief, low-cost interventions can generate significant benefits for physical and emotional health in hospital settings.";The experience highlights the importance of embedding structured wellness practices into public healthcare systems as a means of humanizing care and supporting those who give and receive it. Successful replication requires full alignment with hospital protocols, rigorous facilitator training in both technical and interpersonal skills, and ongoing communication with institutional leadership to maintain trust. Consistent documentation of participation and outcomes strengthens credibility and sustainability, while adapting practices to different hospital spaces ensures accessibility for diverse patients and staff. The key lesson is that intentional moments of guided pause and breath, when offered with sensitivity and clinical awareness, can create profound shifts in emotional regulation and well-being, contributing to healthier work environments and more compassionate care pathways.;"well-being; Worker health; Integrative Practices; Public Hospitals; Healthcare professionals"

Participation was predominantly female initially, becoming exclusively female by 2023. In 2024, the practice was adapted for Capão Redondo through Farol Saúde Integrativa's structured programming. Yogatherapy sessions combined postures (like ""Sphinx"" and ""Warrior""), breathing exercises and final relaxation, using accessible props while allowing space for the instructor's professional adaptations. The approach maintained therapeutic foundations while adapting language and techniques for the local context.";"The project confronted multiple challenges: the Western elitization of yoga (Bernardi et al., 2021) that limits access for vulnerable populations; participants' limiting beliefs about needing an ""ideal body"" to practice; discontinuation due to health issues; notions of belonging; transportation difficulties; and schedule conflicts from work demands (both paid and domestic). These barriers were particularly acute for the female participants. The initiative sought to overcome these through adaptations that maintained yoga's therapeutic integrity (Iyengar, 2016) while making it accessible.
";"In Grajaú, while no systematic data was collected, anecdotal reports indicated benefits including improved mental health among teachers, with one case of a teacher returning to work after burnout. In Capão Redondo (July 2024-March 2025), 29 sessions were held with 54 participants (49 women, 5 men), aged 27-82 (average 51.3). Engagement showed 5 participants attending >4 sessions and 31 attending once. Satisfaction surveys (136 evaluations) showed NPS 93.0 and average rating 9.91/10.
Participants answered written evaluations containing two qualitative questions. The first question asked ""Do you have any criticism, praise or suggestion for future activities?"" with responses showing high satisfaction, particularly noting pain relief (37% of responses), relaxation (45%), and improved mobility (28%). Participants frequently used expressions like ""wonderful,"" ""gratitude,"" and ""left better than I arrived,"" emphasizing the activity's positive impact on self-care, healthy physical challenges, and emotional support.
The second question asked ""What aspect did you enjoy most?"" with participants highlighting: the deep final relaxation (52% of responses), therapeutic movements (especially stretches, twists and poses like ""Sphinx"" and ""Warrior"" - 38%), and the team's affective support (34%). Many reported immediate benefits like pain relief (41% mentioned this, especially lumbar pain), peacefulness, and greater self-connection, with phrases like ""left better than I arrived"" and ""forgetting the outside world."" The combination of breathing and movement was widely praised, as was the instructor's patient methodology and innovative activities (like using balls and reflective cards).
";"To address challenges, several solutions proved effective: anatomical adaptations to improve body literacy; modified language maintaining technical precision; strengthened community bonds; and sessions after 17:00 to accommodate work schedules.

It involves the ability to regulate and harmonize energy through areas that correspond with the known body’s chakras — energy centers aligned along the spine that regulate physical, emotional, and psychological balance. The practice stimulates the parasympathetic nervous system and supports the restoration of energetic homeostasis, contributing to deep relaxation, stress reduction, and overall well-being, as well as eliminating toxins from the body. This report presents the implementation of Reiki sessions at the ZENCancer Institute (IZC), a nonprofit dedicated to supporting cancer patients through integrative care.
The ZENCancer Institute (IZC) is a nonprofit organization that emerged from the personal journey of one of its founders, who turned to Traditional, Complementary and Integrative Medicine (TCIM) as part of her healing process following a breast cancer diagnosis. Deeply moved by the impact of these practices on her well-being, she helped establish the IZC with the goal of expanding access to other cancer patients. The initiative is made possible through the collaboration of volunteers, who both deliver the therapies and participate in the institute’s management.
Upon joining, participants are greeted by the Welcoming Unit, which introduces them to the range of available therapies and guides their initial steps. Those interested in Reiki complete a specific intake form and receive guidance materials. The Reiki Coordination team then assigns a therapist, who initiates contact to schedule sessions. Treatments are conducted online and at a distance, lasting 30–60 minutes weekly over a 12-week period, with the possibility of renewal depending on the participant’s needs. Reiki is also occasionally offered in person, particularly during Restorative Yoga group activities. Over 50 individuals have benefited from Reiki at IZC, with some receiving up to 36 sessions. Transitioning from in-person to online care during the COVID-19 pandemic was a major challenge, but it fostered resilience and innovation. The team adapted through commitment and the creation of structured communication and guidance materials, ensuring continued access.
";Cancer patients frequently experience a range of distressing symptoms, including anxiety, fatigue, pain, sleep disturbances, and emotional imbalance. Reiki sessions at the ZENCancer Institute aim to address these multidimensional challenges by facilitating relaxation, reducing stress, and restoring energetic balance. Evidence suggests that Reiki may be effective in decreasing anxiety and pain, improving sleep quality, and enhancing emotional well-being in oncology settings.;The Reiki program has supported over 50 cancer patients. Participants often report feeling calmer, more centered, and better equipped to cope with the emotional and physical demands of treatment. In addition to promoting well-being, the practice fosters a sense of community, emotional connection, and compassionate, non-invasive care that helps restore patients’ sense of agency and belonging during a vulnerable period.;"To replicate this model, key strategies include: team training; development of a clear and compassionate user guide; and establishing efficient communication channels between coordinators, therapists, and patients.";"Reiki; cancer; usui reiki; cancer therapy"

Each session involved a blend of Mentha spicata L. and Salvia sclarea essential oils inhaled through cotton strips, tactile and visual elements (textured fabrics, colorful objects), music with positive emotional context, storytelling about the plants, and a concluding creative activity painting related allegories. The initiative aimed to provide physical, emotional, and mental balance to the patients while fostering voluntary engagement and social connection.;Patients with severe psychiatric conditions often experience emotional dysregulation, treatment resistance, and limited social interaction. Additionally, health professionals initially expressed skepticism about the clinical effectiveness of integrative practices such as aromatherapy.;Throughout the intervention, increased patient participation, reduced avoidance, and improved affective expression were observed. Team engagement also grew as benefits became evident. Four weeks after the end of the sessions, patients retained memory of the experience and demonstrated ongoing improvements in emotional state and interpersonal communication.;The structured multisensory aromatherapy protocol has proven effective and should be considered a complementary strategy for psychiatric care. Future programs should include standardized evaluation tools, and long-term follow-up to measure lasting impact. Key challenges include training staff and ensuring cultural adaptation of sensory elements. The approach is low-cost, reproducible, and adaptable to diverse health settings.;"aromatherapy; mental health; Integrative Medicine; Psychiatric Rehabilitation"

Qigong is a practice of exercises with the body, mind and spirit, belonging to Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) with at least 8000 years of systematization. One of the most famous Classical Physicians of TCM, Hua Tuo (163 AD), was one of the pioneers in its systematization. In the second half of the 20th century, the Chinese government organized commissions to study and propagate QiGong at the provincial and national levels due to the good results that practitioners had in maintaining their health. After several records and surprising results in curing and preventing diseases, important stimuli began for the practice of this therapy spreading through public parks, also in hospitals. So, we are talking about one of the areas of Medicine Training at the Universities of China, Qi Gong (Chi Kung), which means skill developed through theoretical and practical studies, which results in the control of the flow of internal vital energy known by the Chinese as Qi (Chi). In order to obtain health benefits, medical Qi Gong is used, as it has therapeutic effects of health recovery and healing, which is a practice that emphasizes relaxation that facilitates the circulation of Qi, as well as controlling the respiratory rhythm, the coordination of smooth body movements, and the proper mental attitude. These qualities, put into practice in a conscious and coordinated way, generate the differential of Qi Gong therapy. The objective of this work is to present the Preliminary Results of a research that we started when accompanying elderly people who voluntarily and free of charge participate in a Zhineng Qi Gong Practice Group for the last three years, which is an activity that involves Relaxation (Field Organization), Light Physical Activities, called “Methods” by the creator os this sistem. It also envolves Body Practices of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Meditaciol and Visualization like activities. In this work we present an experience report where knowledge was acquired online about Zhineng Qi Gong, during the pandemic, with teachers from China, and then, it has been shared online, free of charge, with open practices across Brazil, Latin America and Portugal. All these practices are suitable and adaptable to the physical conditions of any person. It was developed and has been disseminated throughout the world since the 1980’s by Doctor Pang Ming, PhD, Doctor trained in Western Medicine and Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), University Professor and Founder of several Study and Research Centers. In China, for example, in Xian. In China there are thousands of practitioners, scholars and researchers who have disseminated these practices that today have benefited from them all over the world.;In Brazil, as we have many elders without adecuated care taken by the government health institutes, this practice has been disseminated in the last five years through Professor Oscar Silva, from Mexico, and Cassiano Takayassu,Dr, from São Paulo. We participated in an International Zhineng Qigong Teather training course in Zhineng Qi Gong, Levels 1, 2 and 3, with Teachers from the Xi’An Zhineng Science Research Center from october 2021 until october 2022. But, In February 2022 we openned a on line, free of charge, Practice Group, and disseminated this informationon internet, through Whatsapp, with activities four times a week (from Monday until Thursday, from 6:30 AM until 7:45 AM. We had several inscriptions, especially from the elderly people. During and after the practices we have seen the development of improvements of physical problems (less pain in the cervical, dorsal and lumbar regions, etc), as well as encreased vitality, more vital energy and joy in the state of mind and in the emotional field. As part of this research, we set up a questionnaire adapted from other research to reports, and part of the results and shared these preliminar results with the scientific community in this abstract / article. We also include in the article part of the integrative, and narrative reviews where we discussed the possibility of taking this Practice On Line, through the SUS structures, to more people, especially the elderly, aiming to bring greater well-being and more longevity with higher life quality.;It appears that the most frequent reactions are WELL BEING, especially after. It is worth mentioning that some practitioners with more experience may report some differentiated benefits, for example, the decrease in the degree of glasses or Special States, deeper Qi Gong state. These processes are expected to occur, as the increasing accumulation of this vital energy allows for the recovery of health and the feeling of youth. During and after the practices, we have followed the development of improvements in physical problems (less pain in the cervical, dorsal and lumbar regions), as well as greater vitality, more energy and joy in the state of mind spetialy in elderly people, as we could see in the answers of this reseach.;We discussed the possibility of taking this Practice On Line, possibly through the SUS (Public Health Care organization in Brazil) structures, to more people, especially the elderly, aiming to bring greater well-being and better quality of life. We aim to get in touch with the official segments that disseminate the Integrative and Complementary Practices in Health (PICS) to take this activity through the Structures of the SUS, as well as through the Public Universities, to the Servers as a way of taking self-care, and through an Extension Project, taking this content to the communities as another opportunity to take care of their Health and Quality of life.;"Zhineng QiGong; Longevity; Tradicional Chineese Medicine; Health of the Elderly; Qi Gong"

Until 2022, the teaching of Integrative and Complementary Health Practices (PICS) occurred sporadically, depending on the individual initiative and prior training of preceptors.
In this context, the PRMFC coordination team partnered with the PICS Management Office of SMS-RJ to create the PICS Task Force (FT-PICS), with the following objectives: (1) systematize the teaching of PICS within the residency’s theoretical curriculum; (2) offer introductory theoretical-practical training to first- and second-year residents (R1 and R2); (3) identify and integrate knowledge already present in the health network; (4) develop materials and strategies applicable to clinical practice in PHC.
Between 2022 and 2024, five in-person seminars were held with theoretical and practical workshops on medical rationalities, foundations of traditional Chinese medicine, auriculotherapy, rational use of medicinal plants, cupping therapy, moxibustion, shantala massage, and self-massage, totaling 551 participants. Educational booklets and instructional videos were also produced and integrated into the residency's virtual learning platform (Moodle), in addition to support for workshops with nurses from the AP 1.0 health district.
The aim of this report is to present the experience of implementing theoretical-practical seminars conducted by FT-PICS at PRMFC/SMS-RJ as a strategy for expanded health education. This experience report follows the SQUIRE guidelines (Standards for Quality Improvement Reporting Excellence) (Ogrinc G, 2016).";"PHC faces increasing demand for comprehensive care due to the high prevalence of chronic conditions such as pain, insomnia, anxiety, and headaches. Conventional responses, centered on medicalization, fail to address the subjective and social dimensions of illness.
PICS offer safe and humanized alternatives (PNPIC, 2006), but their integration into health services is hindered by the lack of structured training and institutional resistance (WHO, 2023). While National Curriculum Guidelines propose comprehensive and humanized training (BRASIL, 2014), PICS remain marginalized in medical education. The integration of systems like Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) still faces obstacles such as lack of robust evidence, regulatory barriers, and cultural resistance (WHO, 2023; Mayo Clinic, 2024).
To broaden access, it is essential to expand PICS training across other health professions, in alignment with each profession’s regulatory frameworks (BRASIL, 2018).";"Since its inception, FT-PICS has conducted five seminars between 2022 and 2024, engaging 551 FCM residents and PHC preceptors. The first edition included 109 participants, followed by sessions with 111, 87, 114, and 120 attendees. Workshops covered PICS with potential for immediate application in PHC and encouraged the development of residency final papers (TCRs), study groups, and local replication by preceptors.
This collaboration strengthened the link between the Residency Program and the Municipal Health Department, fostering technical exchange and joint development of educational materials. Resources produced included an auriculotherapy booklet (SUBPAV, 2024), a medicinal plants guide, and video tutorials on shantala massage (VALDÉS, 2024), cupping, and moxibustion (SOUZA, 2024). These materials were made available on Moodle and institutionalized for use in health facilities.
The experience strengthened teaching autonomy and broadened the residents’ therapeutic repertoire, contributing to a more coherent education aligned with PHC principles. The workshop format, led by preceptors from the program, allowed for adaptations to local realities and offered a practical, experience-based approach to care.";"Among the challenges identified in this report are the limited knowledge of many professionals about PICS, which can generate initial resistance. Additionally, infrastructure limitations and logistical issues—such as restrictions on moxibustion in smoke-detecting environments—were noted. Interprofessional articulation also proved difficult in some units, which compromised the integration of PICS into collective care.
This experience highlights the need to institutionalize PICS training as part of residency curricula, in line with Ordinance GM/MS nº 971, of May 3, 2006, which promotes PICS expansion across all levels of care, with emphasis on primary care. According to Aguiar, Kanan, and Masiero (2019), continuing education is a powerful strategy for consolidating PICS in PHC.
It is recommended to expand training strategies to other professional categories and multiprofessional residency teams, promoting the overcoming of the biomedical paradigm and expanding care and health promotion resources (AGUIAR; KANAN; MASIERO, 2019; SOUZA et al., 2017).
Additionally, the publication of a quick reference PICS guide is suggested, modeled after SUBPAV/SMS-RJ materials and based on FT-PICS content already produced. Strengthening partnerships with networks such as ObservaPICS, CABSIN, and GAIPA-UFC is also recommended to enhance knowledge exchange and consolidate PICS as a structuring axis in SUS-based health education.";"Medical education; Primary Health Care; Residency Training; Traditional Chinese Medicine"

It is not merely about walking or engaging in physical exercise, but about reconnecting with nature through sight, hearing, taste, smell, and touch. Shinrin-yoku serves as a bridge between humans and nature and is the foundation of Forest Medicine, an interdisciplinary science focused on promoting physical and mental health based on evidence.
In the context of the Primary Health Care Unit (UBS), the activity was carried out with adults over the age of 50, presenting diverse health conditions. The idea originated from a team member who was already familiar with the practice and recognized the importance of offering it to users as a form of integrative care. The ecological park, accessible and well-structured, features a sensory trail with natural obstacles such as tree roots, water puddles, and tactile objects that stimulate the senses through barefoot walking and blindfolded experience.
The planning began at the start of the year, with an invitation extended to users to join a care group. A partnership was established with a transportation company to provide a bus with a capacity for 44 people. The group included one nursing assistant, two pharmacists, and three community health agents. Attendance was confirmed via phone calls and home visits.
On March 14, the visit took place and lasted five hours. Upon arrival, participants were welcomed with a body awareness activity. The park team gave an orientation about the experience, explaining guidelines and safety measures. Two guides individually accompanied each user along the trail, which lasted approximately two hours. Blindfolded and barefoot, participants were led through a path where they were stimulated by the sounds of water and wind, the smell of firewood and leaves, the feel of the earth, and the taste of offered fruits.
At the end of the trail, participants removed their blindfolds and faced a mirror, symbolizing a reconnection with themselves. The activity concluded with a group conversation circle, a shared snack, auriculotherapy, and contemplative walking. Reactions ranged from initial anxiety to deep emotional responses, with reports of childhood memories, a sense of peace, and reconnection with nature and one’s own senses.";"•	Disconnection from nature and from oneself;

In this context, Reiki courses at levels I, II, IIIA, and IIIB have been offered to train individuals in the practice and to support outpatient care both in-person and remotely. Additionally, certified Reiki practitioners participate in events across Fiocruz campuses, demonstrating institutional support for the dissemination of PICS. Reiki is a technique that utilizes Universal Energy, and from level I onward, its practice aims to foster physical, emotional, and spiritual balance for practitioners.

This report underscores the importance of qualified Reiki practitioners who can serve as disseminators of the practice, thereby contributing to the promotion of health and well-being within the institution. Since April 2017, the APSCS has developed and progressively expanded access to Reiki training for individuals affiliated with Fiocruz, offering all levels of the course. Course promotion has been conducted via institutional communication channels. The curriculum combines theoretical and practical components rooted in the traditional system established by Mikao Usui, encompassing the philosophy of the five principles and the 125 poems associated with Emperor Meiji. The training duration is 30 hours for levels I, II, and IIIA, and 60 hours for level IIIB. Classes are delivered by an active IOC employee qualified as a Reiki Master in both Brazil and Japan, through online platforms and in-person sessions, ensuring an accessible, low-cost program. Courses are convened biannually, and in 2019, a dedicated class for individuals with hearing impairments (PPDA), supported by sign language interpreters, was conducted.

Between March 2020 and July 2022, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, all activities shifted to online formats to adhere to safety protocols, increasing remote Reiki teaching and care. In-person sessions resumed with the support of alumni volunteers, with records maintained both in physical logs and digital platforms. Starting in 2022, trained Reiki practitioners have also participated in various ceremonial events at different Fiocruz units, providing Reiki practice as part of institutional activities.


";"
The impossibility of providing care, as hospitals were overwhelmed with emergency care during the COVID pandemic, the insufficient public investment in adequate infrastructure and facilities at the institution's headquarters hindered the development and practice of Reiki among employees, students, scholarship recipients, retirees, and outsourced staff involved in management, teaching, and research. To address this, we transitioned the practice to an online format, providing an opportunity for many participants to enhance their well-being. This approach helped alleviate feelings of depression and isolation, fear, sadness, anguish, and anxiety generated by isolation, resulting from the suspension of in-person activities during the COVID-19 pandemic.";"Over the past 8 years, the APSCS has provided training for Reiki practitioners to individuals belonging to the IOC and other units of Fiocruz, such as the Fernandes Figueira Institute for Women, Children and Adolescents (IFF), National Institute of Infectiology (INI), General Coordination of Campus Infrastructure, Farmanguinhos, Biomanguinhos, Atlantic Forest Unit, National School of Public Health, and for other states such as Bahia, Pernambuco, Fortaleza, Minas Gerais, and Manaus within the same institution. Thus, 726 Reiki certificates have been issued, distributed among levels I = 311, II = 205, IIIA = 148, and IIIB = 62, totaling 30 classes, including one class with 8 PPDA. We observed that the majority of Reiki graduates were employees (32.21%) of the IOC (43.43%) and women (88.65%). To date, we have recorded about 5,136 in-person sessions at the IOC unit and 810 in other units, both in Reiki, with the support of Reiki practitioners trained by the institution. Furthermore, this practice has been present at events held at the Fiocruz campuses on commemorative dates such as Nursing Day, International Women's Day, IFF Centenary, Labor Day, anniversaries of Fiocruz and the IOC, Fiocruz for You, as well as other events, totaling 1,086 sessions. Remote sessions were conducted, but their data are not included in this scope.
This report highlights the pivotal role of APSCS in the dissemination of PICS through the ongoing availability of Reiki training and practice sessions, both in-person and remotely. The initiative has achieved significant engagement, with over 6,200 participants in Reiki sessions and 726 individuals trained. The network of Reiki practitioners fosters a culture of self-care and positive interpersonal interactions, including support for groups such as PPDA. During periods of social isolation, remote Reiki played a crucial role in addressing emotional and spiritual needs, contributing to the overall well-being of participants.";"Demonstrate to IOC management the critical significance of expanding and sustaining Reiki programs for institutional personnel to enhance overall health conditions. 
Recognize that the Institutional staff, due to operational workload, have limited access to Reiki practices, which may contribute to burnout in the absence of supportive measures. 
Additionally, investing in specialized professional training presents a logistical and financial challenge within the context of a public institutional framework.";"Reiki; Health; Professional Training"

Officially incorporated into Brazil’s Unified Health System (SUS) through the National Policy on Integrative and Complementary Practices (PNPIC)¹, these practices are currently available in 29 different modalities, offered free of charge to the population.²
In the Amazon, the term ""traditional peoples"" refers to groups who, although not Indigenous, preserve lifestyles, cultural practices, and orally transmitted knowledge deeply rooted in their territories and closely connected to the local ecosystem.³ Among these groups, the *ribeirinhos* (riverine peoples) stand out for maintaining ancestral health practices, such as the use of medicinal teas, oils, prayers, therapeutic baths, and rituals, often associated with the power of the forest, water, and natural cycles.
Recognizing the strength of this traditional knowledge and the importance of valuing it within healthcare, we conducted an integrative health circle with the community, creating a space for listening, sharing, and knowledge exchange. During this gathering, community members shared their experiences and traditional practices, explaining how they use them in daily life. The concept of integrative health was then presented, emphasizing its alignment with local wisdom, and the community was invited to participate, experiment, and co-create with us a broader, dialogical, and culturally respectful model of care.
The Amazone-se project experience, carried out in the community of Anã, aimed to provide comprehensive care by integrating practices such as Reiki, herbal foot baths, phytoenergetics, auriculotherapy, and mindfulness with clinical services in gynecology, ultrasound imaging, nutrition, and physiotherapy. A total of 433 services were provided, bridging clinical care with local knowledge. For this to be effective, active listening and collaborative work with the community were essential in understanding their needs and adapting the practices offered to their specific realities.";"Objectives
To report the experience of the Amazone-se project in Vila Anã, highlighting the integration of integrative practices with clinical care for the riverine population, respecting their traditional knowledge and promoting a broader understanding of health.

Methodology
This is a descriptive study in the form of an experience report, based on the *Amazone-se* project carried out in Vila Anã, Pará. The target population consisted of residents from the riverine community, attended by a multidisciplinary health team. Data were collected through participant observation, field diary notes, and testimonials from community members. Active listening was employed during the consultations, enabling more humanized and respectful care. The integrative practices offered were aligned with the National Policy on Integrative and Complementary Practices (PNPIC)¹, aiming at the co-creation of care together with the community. The analysis was conducted through reflection on the challenges, perceptions, and impacts generated by the intervention.";"Results
The experience developed with the community allowed for an expanded approach to healthcare, going beyond traditional biomedical models by integrating the physical, emotional, social, and cultural dimensions of the therapeutic process. The practices offered provided pain relief, reduced anxiety, induced deep relaxation, and fostered an enhanced sense of well-being among participants.
Reiki and auriculotherapy were particularly well received, frequently reported as effective in reducing symptoms of anxiety and chronic pain. The herbal foot bath, when combined with phytoenergetics, had a significant symbolic and emotional impact, as it directly engaged with ancestral practices already recognized and applied in the community, such as the use of medicinal herbs and therapeutic baths. This integration strengthened the connection between popular knowledge and the health team’s technical expertise, promoting mutual exchange and appreciation.
Before individual consultations began, a group mindfulness session was conducted, inviting participants to connect with the present moment, to perceive the surrounding forest, to listen to its sounds and inhale its aromas, and to pay attention to their breathing and bodily sensations. This moment of pause and full presence fostered emotional readiness for care and created a sensitive, respectful, and welcoming atmosphere.
The integrative approach proved powerful in building therapeutic bonds between professionals and community members, generating a climate of trust, attentive listening, and mutual recognition. Active listening, as both a methodological and ethical practice, proved essential for capturing the uniqueness of each person, enabling more sensitive and context-appropriate care. Many participants reported not only physical relief but also a sense of belonging and reconnection with their beliefs, as if the practices had rekindled dormant knowledge and affections. This symbolic care, combined with the perceived efficacy of the practices, significantly contributed to adherence to the therapies offered.
Thus, the experience reinforces the importance of recognizing and incorporating Integrative and Complementary Practices in healthcare for traditional populations, respecting their ways of life, spirituality, knowledge systems, and healing practices.

Conclusions
The integration between integrative practices and clinical care proved effective in promoting comprehensive health care. Respect for traditional knowledge and the co-creation of care strategies were essential for the success of the initiative. Active listening and collaboration were central to delivering more humanized and effective care. This experience underscores the need for public policies that support the implementation of PICS in traditional territories, expanding access to humanized and holistic care. Future studies may further assess the impact of these practices on the quality of life of the populations served.";"Include popular and community knowledge as an integral part of healthcare, promoting training initiatives that value ancestral knowledge and encourage intercultural dialogue between professionals and communities.

In response to this panorama, complementary and integrative therapies, such as Acupuncture and Moxibustion, emerge, are validated, and reassert themselves as objectively valuable and subjectively effective alternatives for restoring holistic health balance.
Within the framework of the XVIII International Congress of the Hispano-American Acupuncture Association Beijing'84, held in Cuenca, Spain, in October 2022, the necessity of offering an innovative response to the severe chronic deterioration linked to currently adopted lifestyles was raised. It was recognized that human beings, by their natural design, possess within themselves the necessary resources and capacities to re-evaluate, rectify, remodel, rehabilitate, and project themselves as healthy beings.";"This study qualitatively analyzes the perceptions and experiences of therapists applying the ""To Fall Ill in the 21st Century, Lifestyles"" (ESXXIEV) treatment, evaluating its impact on various diseases and the clinical evolution of the patients attended.
3.	Methodology 
Therapeutic Intervention (ESXXIEV): The ESXXIEV treatment is based on a humanistic and energetic vision. It involves the application of indirect moxibustion to specific acupuncture points: 4TM (Mingmen) ""The Gate of Destiny"" and 8RM (Shén Qè), ""Fusion with the Breath"" or ""Gate of the Palace of Emotions"". Additionally, needling is performed at 20TM (Baihui), ""The Hundred Meetings""; 4C (Shenmen), ""Sense of the Spirit"" or ""Path of the Spirit""; 4B (Gong Sung), ""Universal Offering""; and 7TR (Hui Zong), ""	Meeting with Our Ancestors"". This treatment was applied weekly for 3 months.
Data Collection: Data collection focused on exhaustively documenting the experiences, attitudes, and practices of therapists during the application of the ESXXIEV treatment. A dual and complementary strategy was employed to capture patient evolution through the therapists' perceptions:
1.1	 Focal Groups: Two meetings were held with focal groups composed of therapists from the 20 participating countries.
1.2	 Structured Interview (Google Forms): Key perceptions and observations emerging from the focal groups were condensed and tabulated through a structured interview, administered exclusively to therapists via a Google Form.
Data Analysis: Analysis was performed using a qualitative-phenomenological approach:
Qualitative Analysis: Transcriptions from the focal groups and textual responses from the Google Form underwent inductive thematic analysis, influenced by the principles of Grounded Theory.
Participants: The reference population consisted of 100 therapists who attended a total of 4,668 patients across 50 clinical centers of the Neijing Schools, distributed in 20 countries in Europe and America. Participants presented with various chronic pathologies, including oncological, cardiovascular, mental, neurodegenerative diseases, and chronic pain syndromes. All participants signed informed consent forms, ensuring the reliability and confidentiality of the collected data. The study was conducted in accordance with the ethical principles established in the Declaration of Helsinki.
It is important to highlight that the execution of this research proposal represented a significant challenge, as it constituted the first multicenter experience for our Institution across its locations in 20 countries. Furthermore, a primary limitation identified was the absence of a research format that would allow for an in-depth evaluation of the energetic responses of the self, which are not quantifiable by conventional methods. It is worth mentioning that the research was carried out without external funding, relying exclusively on internal resources. Finally, no conflicts of interest of any kind are declared.";"The results revealed a consensus on the remarkable efficacy of the ESXXIEV treatment in improving patients' lifestyle and quality of life. High patient adherence was observed, interpreted as a direct reflection of the relevance and positive outcome of the approach. The versatility and multivalence of the treatment allowed for its adaptation to individual needs, demonstrating consistent improvements across various dimensions.
Therapists highlighted improvements in: Physical Health: sleep quality, eating habits, and vitality.
Mental and Emotional Health: stabilization of mood states and significant reduction in anxiety.
Spiritual and Existential Well-being: increased awareness of lifestyle and the desire and purpose to live.
Affectivity and Sexuality: related to the awareness of experiencing feelings in the realm of intimacy and their degree of enjoyment and fullness.
Social Role: improvement in interrelationship and interdependence bonds through the harmonization of overall well-being.
A particularly positive response was found in women.";"It is recommended to strengthen the work of multidisciplinary teams to implement health prevention and promotion actions, integrating physical activity, conscious eating, meditation, and self-care education. The importance of focusing resources and tools especially on women's well-being is emphasized, thereby promoting the replication and expansion of the treatment from a preventive and integral perspective.
4.	Contribution to the Field 
This experience demonstrates that the ESXXIEV treatment holistically improves health and prevents future ailments, contributing to the advancement of integrative therapies. The holistic approach is highlighted for promoting sustainable well-being and rapid improvement in quality of life, with positive effects at both individual and community levels, regardless of treatment duration.";"Traditional Chinese Medicine; Lifestyles; Integrative Therapies; Prevention and Promotion"

This process also involved selection of the facilitators and the definition of their competencies to deliver PICS effectively.
Launched in March 2025, this initiative aims to promote self-care, health self-management, and the revitalization of ancestral and traditional practices, using PICS to support the management of chronic conditions (Brazil, 2015). Participants of all ages, genders, sexual orientations, races, and ethnic backgrounds, regardless of their affiliation with social movements or collectives, were invited to participate through outreach on social media and recruited via an online registration form.
The services are provided weekly. They are free of charge, and designed to be inclusive, combining both in-person and telemonitoring components. This includes the use of many tools, among others the electronic questionnaires to assess participant’s profiles and clinical characteristics such as, the quality of life and sleep, the levels of pain, stress, anxiety, and depression. These tools also contribute to mapping the prevalence of the  chronic noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), as well as the participants’ living conditions and the functional health status of the same patients.
The PICS offered at the outpatient monitoring clinic included: Yoga and Meditation, which support stress management, improve sleep quality, and reduce inflammation, positively impacting overall well-being (Barros et al., 2014); Anthroposophic Medicine, which fosters an integrative approach by considering the balance between body, mind, and spirit (Dos Santos & Paineiras-Domingos, 2024); Reiki and Manual Therapy, which help relieve chronic pain, reduce anxiety, and improve circulation (Freitag et al., 2014); and  Reflexology, which stimulates energy points on the feet and hands, alleviating symptoms and contributing to the overall balance of the body (Dacal & Silva, 2018).";The outpatient clinic addresses the high prevalence of  chronic noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) among the Black population, particularly in Salvador, Bahia, where this group faces significant social vulnerability. These chronic conditions severely impact quality of life and are closely linked to social, emotional, economic, and environmental determinants (Pasquetti et al., 2021). Compounding this issue is the persistence of the traditional biomedical model in many healthcare settings, which often fails to consider the holistic nature of individuals in their healthcare pathway. In this context, there is a pressing need to broaden access to integrative therapeutic practices, such as Integrative and complementary health practices (PICS), as effective alternatives for the prevention, symptom relief, and management of NCDs. These practices support the physical, mental, and emotional well-being of the population. Another critical issue is the lack of equity in healthcare access. In response, initiatives like this outpatient clinic play a key role in upholding the right to health by offering free, inclusive, and high-quality care, particularly to historically underserved populations.;The outpatient clinic represents a strategic social intervention, providing multidisciplinary, accessible, integrative and inclusive care. One major impact of this initiative is the implementation of weekly telemonitoring, made possible by the fact that all participants have access to basic digital technologies at home. This enables continuous support for the monitoring of self-care and health self-management practices sustained in participants’ daily routines. Another major impact is the generation of academic and scientific output, including peer-reviewed articles and educational materials, aligned with the university’s dual mission to both provide care to the community and produce scientifically grounded knowledge, to support evidence-based clinical decision-making and to contribute to the formulation and improvement of inclusive public health policies.;Integrative and Complementary Health Practices (PICS) are therapeutic approaches that use traditional, ancient, and ancestral techniques as strategies to promote health and well-being. Consequently, they are also used in disease prevention. PICS were incorporated into Brazil's Unified Health System (SUS) through the National Policy for Integrative and Complementary Health Practices (PNPICS), established in 2006 by the Ministry of Health. This policy aims to expand and strengthen therapeutic approaches that complement conventional treatments, allowing for a comprehensive view of individual health and promoting practices grounded in both traditional and scientific knowledge, thereby challenging the conventional biomedical model. The PNPICS recognizes 29 modalities of PICS, including Yoga, Meditation, Anthroposophy, Ayurveda, Reiki, Manual Therapy, and Reflexology. Chronic Noncommunicable Diseases (NCDs) are long-term conditions with a slow progression, such as systemic arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus, obesity, cancer, metabolic syndrome, osteoarthritis, and respiratory diseases like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Additionally, fibromyalgia and systemic lupus erythematosus, which are especially prevalent in the Black population, are also classified as chronic conditions. These diseases can significantly impact an individual's quality of life and are strongly influenced by many factors, such as social, emotional, economic, and environmental factors. The proposed outpatient clinic, an initiative of the Health of the Black Population and Chronic Diseases Research Group, is being implemented at the Federal University of Bahia.;"Integrative and complementary health practices; Outpatient telemonitoring clinic; Chronic Noncommunicable Diseases"

This work aims to report the use of hypnotherapy as a therapeutic tool in the treatment of obesity, promoting emotional self-management and self-care. This experience report describes the use of hypnotherapy as a complementary practice in a hospital specialized in the treatment of obesity. The experience involved individual psychological care using hypnotherapy in patients hospitalized for a period of up to six months, with multidisciplinary support, very low-calorie diets, between January 2020 and November 2022. Hypnotherapy was applied, biweekly, to 120 patients of both sexes, aged ? 18 years, during consultations with psychologists, lasting sixty minutes. Hypnotherapy was used as an auxiliary resource to psychotherapy, focusing on emotional regulation, self-esteem, binge eating and motivation for lifestyle changes. The proposal was approved by the Research Ethics Committee (opinion no. 7,498,693) and aimed to expand therapeutic resources to deal with eating impulses, anxiety, hopelessness and low self-esteem, commonly present in the weight loss process.;The patients in this study reported a history of failure in previous attempts to reduce weight and demonstrated resistance to new lifestyle changes. In this sense, it was necessary to promote emotional self-management and self-care necessary to maintain the healthy clinical weight acquired during hospitalization through behavioral changes. Hypnotic interventions contributed to the redefinition of experiences, access to states of tranquility and the reorganization of beliefs, aspects necessary for lifestyle changes.;Among the patients who received Hypnotherapy, spontaneous reports were observed that evidenced emotional relief (80%), improved sleep (39%), reduced food anxiety (50%) and greater willingness to do physical activities (60%). Half of the patients reported using self-hypnosis exercises in moments of tension, referring to a feeling of stability and security.;The implementation of hypnosis in the treatment of obesity required adaptation of the environment, professional training and continuous monitoring. The space was equipped with a chair adapted to support up to 300 kg, in addition to sound and lighting environments configured for reception and relaxation. It was necessary to carry out a training course in hypnotherapy for the team of psychologists, aiming to guarantee the safety and effectiveness of the care provided. During the entire hospitalization, continuous monitoring was carried out with active listening to the demands and desires of the patients, within a perspective of expanded therapeutic care. It is important to emphasize that obesity treatment institutions have qualified professionals and integrated therapeutic plans, favoring the ethical, safe and qualified use of hypnotherapy. When used with technical and ethical responsibility, hypnotherapy enhances humanized care and can strengthen the subjective experience of change. Thus, hypnotherapy is configured as a relevant resource in the comprehensive and humanized care of patients with obesity.;"hypnotherapy; clinical hypnosis; obesity; Integrative Practices; Self-Care"

The music therapy intervention was inspired by the reflections of Byung-Chul Han (2021) on the societal illness resulting from the Disappearance of Rituals, aiming to explore the music therapeutic resources inherent in the cultural manifestations of Afro-Amerindian-Diasporic rhythmic communities.

This initiative was carried out within the scope of the university community outreach project COMunicaSOM, affiliated with the UFRJ Music Therapy program. Throughout the course dynamics, it was possible to deepen and enrich the understanding of the therapeutic application of symbolic content, based on the concept of Music as Metaphor (BARCELLOS, 2009), as produced during collective drum-based music therapy practice.";"Based on the complexity of Drum Grammars and the music therapy premises of Drum Circles, it was possible to identify contradictions, oppositions, implications, and logical negations resulting from the application of the Semiotic Square—a fundamental component of Greimas’s (1975) Generative Path of Meaning—which revealed valuable meanings for clinical music therapy practice.

Greimassian Semiotics was applied through the identification of dialectical oppositions unveiled in the symbolic dimension of the Drum Grammar, which can be understood as conveying metaphors and meanings associated with the musical gestures (BARCELLOS, 2009) of drumming.";;In order for Discourse Semiotics to be understood as a methodology for signifying the Grammars of Drum Circles, it is first necessary to produce a cartography that deepens and highlights the epistemological complexity of the chosen ethno-cultural rhythmic tradition. This condition is essential for enriching the research from a decolonial perspective, with the aim of revealing new pathways for music therapy grounded in bioethics and cognitive justice.;"Circle Drums; Drumming; Music Therapy"

The beginning of this 29-year journey was as a University Extension project within the hospital, offering services to nursing professionals who worked in the Emergency Room of the Polydoro Ernani de São Thiago University Hospital of the Federal University of Santa Catarina (HU-UFSC). From 2004 onwards, its scope of action was expanded, with its care model adapted to the academic context of UFSC (faculty, students, technical-administrative staff, HU-UFSC employees). In 2012, it started serving civil society communities. The driving force of Amanhecer is the work of social volunteers and professional volunteers who form a multidisciplinary health team, intending to serve the triad: higher education, extension activities, and research.;Over 29 years, 50 individual and collective alternative therapies have been offered. This demonstrates the therapeutic breadth of Amanhecer, which allows it to be a field for countless scientific researches, especially in the areas of health and social sciences. In this context, Course Conclusion Papers, Mandatory and Non-Mandatory Internships were carried out by students of Undergraduate Courses, Multiprofessional Health Residencies and Post-doctoral programs. Amanhecer also collaboratively participated in internal events at UFSC and State and National Congresses (hosted in Florianópolis), making therapies available to the participants of the events. Amanhecer is recognized as an organized health service that offers assistance, education, and work through integrative health, promoting a natural form of disease and injury prevention, enabling health recovery through safe means using natural resources, in which there is a search for care away from medicalization practices and the biologicist model. As Amanhecer does not deal with conventional therapies, there is frequently a search for partnerships by the University Hospital, allowing the medical axis extra contribution, with complementary therapies contributing to the health and well-being of users. Therefore, this pillar is, above all, a return to the origin of Medical Science knowledge, allowing immersion in complementary oriental, western, and psychological health techniques. The purpose of the present work is to report the quantitative evolution of services provided in the period from 2022 to 2024. Thus, we took the years 2020 and 2021 as a reference, because due to the Covid-19 pandemic, there was a reduction in the total number of services. It is worth noting that during this period, only therapies that could be performed asynchronously or remotely were offered. In this scenario, the total sum of services performed in 2020 and 2021 was 2.173.;"With the gradual return to in-person activities, 11 therapies were offered in 2022, totaling 1,275 services. This low number of services can be justified, in part, by the slow return of participants to in-person activities, as well as by the change in physical space. Up until 2019, Amanhecer was entirely based at HU-UFSC, and from 2022 onwards, its activities were distributed among other sectors of UFSC, which generated orientation difficulties for participants regarding the service location8. However, the relevance of Amanhecer as a health service, recognized by the community, led to exceeding expectations in recent years8. In 2023 and 2024, 15 and 17 therapies were offered, respectively. The therapies offered totaled 2.439 services in 2023 and 3.247 services in 2024. When comparing the number of services in 2022 with 2024, we verified that there was a 60% increase in services for the last year. This indicates an increasing demand for TCM practices at Amanhecer, as well as the quality of the services. The therapies offered by Amanhecer in the evaluated period were individual, collective, and in group, cited below. Individual therapies: Quantum Apometry; Hypnotherapy; Homeopathy; Floral Therapy (traditional, Bach flower remedies); Natural Therapy (Floral and Phytotherapy); Quantum Therapy (Caring Hands/Neural Silence/Reiki). Collective therapies: Reiki and Quantum Apometry. Group therapies: Biodanza; Family Constellation; Circular Dance of Peace Meditation in Movement (Ruhaniat International); Meditative Circular Dance of Tärä Dhatu; Hatha Yoga; Kundalini Yoga; Meditation and Deep Relaxation; Tai Chi Chuan. The data on therapies reported in this work point to a consolidated partnership of volunteer professionals in Care, which significantly contributes to community health.";"It is extremely important to monitor results and integrate research projects into the Laboratório Amanhecer, and the provided sources indicate that Amanhecer already fulfills and values these aspects.
The document itself is titled ""Relatório do quantitativo evolucional de atendimentos do Laboratório Amanhecer nos anos de 2022 a 2024"", which demonstrates that quantitative results monitoring is an established practice. This monitoring allowed for the verification of a 60% increase in services between 2022 and 20243, indicating an ""ascending demand for TCM practices at Amanhecer, as well as the quality of services"". This highlights the importance of continuing to track this data to evidence the relevance and impact of the service.
Furthermore, Amanhecer is recognized for intending to serve the ""triad: higher education, extension activities, and research"", meaning that research is a fundamental pillar since its conception. The sources explicitly state that the Laboratory ""allows itself to be a field for numerous scientific researches, especially in the areas of health and social sciences"".
More specifically, the integration of research projects already occurs actively, with the completion of:
Undergraduate Thesis Works (TCC).
Mandatory and Non-Mandatory Internships by undergraduate students.
Multiprofessional Residencies in the Health area.
Post-doctorates.
Therefore, Laboratório Amanhecer already demonstrates a strong commitment to monitoring its results and integrating research projects, which are crucial elements for its continuous academic and social validation. Maintaining and expanding this research integration allows not only to document the impact of the therapies offered but also to generate new knowledge in the field of integrative healt";"• Integrative and Complementary Medicine (ICM); University Extension; Healthcare Services / Patient Care"

Its theoretical foundations include Gestalt Therapy, Integrative Community Therapy, Positive Psychiatry, Vibrational Medicine, Integrative and Complementary Practices, the Philosophy of Care, Neuroscience, and the study of Spirituality.

This approach was developed through the author’s theoretical and clinical experience over the past four decades, through neuropsychiatric and psychotherapeutic care, as well as the facilitation of workshops, training sessions, and therapeutic groups focused on personal and collective self-discovery and transformation. Her engagement with Integrative Community Therapy, both as a therapist and trainer also contributed significantly to the refinement of TTE's principles and practices.

Since 1986, the author has played an active role in introducing alternative therapies into Brazil’s public healthcare system, a term that referred at the time to what is now known as Traditional, Complementary, and Integrative Medicine - TCIM. She was part of the first implementation group within the social health  network, under the former Ministry of Social Welfare (Ministério da Previdência e Assistência Social – MPAS). 

With the creation of Brazil’s Unified Health System (Sistema Único de Saúde - SUS) , she later helped to implement acupuncture, homeopathy, phytotherapy, and natural nutrition at the Mental Health Institute of the Federal District, a public mental health day-hospital. These practices were expanded into the broader mental health policy of the Federal District Government, serving as a reference for similar initiatives in other Brazilian states.


Transessential Therapy is based on three core principles: 1 - Individuals and groups are the agents of their own healing and transformation; 2 - There is no overcoming or healing without self-transformation; 3 - The therapist-individual and therapist-group relationship must be grounded in compassion, generosity, and mutual trust. TTE views both individuals and groups as presenting diverse needs and expressions of suffering. As such, it requires a systemic and contextual assessment that includes all levels of the human essence, forming what is known as the Transessential Spiral. The primary goal of TTE is to enhance clarity regarding the sources of suffering and, based on the imbalances identified, to design a therapeutic sequence tailored to those needs, thereby avoiding fragmented or disjointed care. Each level of that spiral requires a specific form of harmonization or therapeutic approach, with the ultimate aim of restoring overall balance and well-being.
";"With extensive experience in various TCIM methodologies, and to avoid the fragmentation often found in such approaches, the author recognized the need to develop a method capable of integrating the multiple dimensions of human essence: physical-biological, etheric-vibrational, emotional, mental, consciousness-based, and spiritual. She aimed to create a tool to assist in patient or group anamnesis, allowing for an understanding across these dimensions and the identification of any disharmonies, so that an appropriate and individualized therapeutic program could be developed. 
The initial premise was that, given the diversity of integrative approaches, each with distinct principles and methods of action, the therapist must first understand the clinical and experiential dynamics of the individual or group. Only then can they recommend the most suitable treatment to address the dysfunctions identified during the assessment. TTE emerged from this essential need to gain deeper insight into those who suffer and to offer a synergistic, systemic approach to healing. ";"Below is a clinical case illustrating the application of TTE.
MCA, 33 years old, with a history of psychiatric treatment for 10 years. Intense suffering with no prospect of improvement despite numerous psychiatric treatments. Since adolescence, symptoms of discouragement, chronic fatigue, lack of energy for work and life; periods of sadness, hopelessness, and mood instability, distress, and depressive mood; irritability and impatience. Allergies since childhood, occasional diarrhea, and skin lesions. Relatively functional family, caring parents, and good academic development. 
In adulthood, difficulty working and chronic fatigue. In the transessential anamnesis, a detailed map of her health was made, targeting all essential fields, which showed symptoms of depression and a general impairment of the physical body and her emotional state, with a prescription for antidepressants and other guidelines for physical-biological needs in a systemic way. She began physical exercise and dietary guidance (gluten-free and dairy-free diet). During consultations, the patient was always encouraged to understand the importance of the transessential spiral fields as a whole and to adopt a self-aware attitude, including showing scientific evidence (mental field).
She participated in a spiritual retreat (spiritual field) and physical health care (physical-biological field) that included a natural diet and the replacement of micronutrients necessary to activate her metabolism. She was diagnosed with occult inflammation as the systemic source of the problem, being treated by Healthy Longevity and referred for psychotherapy.
After 12 months of treatment, MCA showed significant improvement in her depressive symptoms and physical complaints, with a willingness to work and return to her normal life. The improvement occurred even with the suspension of antidepressants.
MCA says she has gained a lot of enthusiasm for life, recognizing her emotional problems and her commitment to self-transformation (emotional field). She began volunteer work helping women who are victims of abuse, thus investing in the field of consciousness.
This example shows that the various fields of the transessential spiral are connected, even though the main complaint indicated a diagnosis of depression in official medicine, reaffirming that we are an integrated whole. Illness and dysfunction can manifest themselves through any of these fields and in multiple forms. When healthcare professionals are attentive to the whole, they are much more likely to reach the central cause and treat the root of the problem.
";TTE is also intended to dynamically assess individuals or groups, allowing for the construction of a therapeutic path aligned with the needs of each specific moment or situation. An important secondary function of this approach is to support interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary collaboration. The use of the Transessential Spiral serves as a shared, attuned language among healthcare professionals, enabling the creation of a coherent and collaborative therapeutic team.;"Keywords: Transessential Therapy; Self-Transformation; Transessential Spiral; Transdisciplinary Team; Integrative and Complementary Practices"

In pediatrics, it is not uncommon to encounter babies and young children who have already gone through multiple rounds of medication for symptoms that are part of normal physiological development — such as colic, fever, sleep changes, or mild viral infections. The demand for immediate relief, coupled with parental fear and hurried clinical listening, often leads to early interventions, without allowing the child's body the opportunity to respond naturally.

In integrative pediatrics, we develop a clinical reasoning that goes beyond this fragmented and objective academic view. The professional's role is not only to diagnose and prescribe but to understand the factors involved in the health-disease process, to interpret the body's signals to caregivers, and to restore their confidence in their own caregiving capacity. Active listening, addressing parental concerns, and clear explanations of physiological processes became the foundation of this experience.";As a pediatrician, I learned about diseases. As a pediatrician with an integrative approach, I learned about health and about empowering caregivers to make conscious decisions regarding their children. After my training in Integrative Medicine, I set aside prescription pads and pens and began using my voice more. I introduced practices such as therapeutic touch and natural hygiene in infants with colic, clinical observation of fever without the automatic use of antipyretics, and immune support through nutritional measures (dietary guidance and preventive supplementation), along with improving gut health by using substances that enhance barrier integrity and microbiota balance.;"These practices were implemented in my private clinic, where I have followed a total of 480 patients aged 0–13 years since March 2024. A significant reduction was observed in emergency room visits (public and private) and in the indiscriminate prescription of antibiotics in this population. There was also a remarkable reduction in hospital admissions due to acute respiratory conditions, with only three cases reported in 2025. The outcomes of this approach go beyond therapeutic aspects: they include parental satisfaction from feeling respected and confident, as well as my own professional fulfillment in knowing that I am providing the best possible care, prescribing medication only when truly necessary. Over time, families who once sought quick fixes began to value listening, bonding, and non-invasive care.

This personal and professional journey confirmed, in practice, what the principles of Integrative Medicine already emphasize: healing does not come only from external measures, but from strengthening the body as a whole—in its physical, emotional, and even spiritual dimensions. The demedicalization of childhood does not mean the absence of care. On the contrary, when medication is necessary, it is used consciously. But this care can—and should—be deeper, where time, presence, and awareness also become therapeutic tools.";"Even within the time and infrastructure constraints often imposed by public health systems and private insurance, it is possible to implement integrative strategies safely and effectively. The key is a shift in focus — from the immediacy of symptom suppression to respectful, active listening to the child’s body. Instead of silencing with medication, we aim to understand.

This experience reinforces the urgency of including integrative practices in medical education, especially in pediatrics. The care of children can no longer be reactive and prescription-based. It must be grounded in education, prevention, and connection — the true pillars of health.";"pediatrics; Integrative Medicine; Medicina Integrativa"

Each fever, cry, change in sleep or appetite is part of the manifestation of a whole, a small fragment of a complex and profound system. A child’s health is not limited to physical aspects; it reflects a set of internal and external experiences, often silent, that cross emotional and even spiritual dimensions. The child’s body, in its wisdom, reveals what cannot yet be expressed in words. Frequently, what manifests in the child’s organism is intimately connected to the emotional state of those around them—especially the mother.

It was Candace Pert who coined the concept of bodymind. The fusion of the words body and mind, written as one, reminds us of the impossibility of separating them in human care. Every emotion generates a physical response; every thought translates into a complex chemistry of neurotransmitters that connect organs and systems. In childhood, the developing brain receives stimuli not only from the child’s own body but also from their caregivers. The bodymind expands: illness often becomes not only the child’s expression but also a reflection of the relational bonds surrounding them.";From my training in integrative pediatrics, my clinical listening transformed. The 15-minute disease-focused consultation learned in medical school was replaced by attentive observation of the family, which no longer fit within a single hour. I began to see beyond the complaint, recognizing that the expressed symptom, however simple it might seem, could reflect something greater: a relational imbalance, invisible exhaustion, or sustained tension within the family environment. I learned to observe not only physical signs, but also the way a caregiver expresses themselves when speaking about the child: the tone of voice, the weariness in the eyes, the pauses that carry more than words.;"In light of this, I systematically incorporated active listening to the mother as part of the clinical history in my private practice. I created spaces of support, validated maternal feelings, and offered simple practices for emotional self-regulation. I always made it clear that this was a safe place where mothers could express their feelings, uncertainties, and guilt. I also prioritized maternal physical health, with nutritional guidance and supplementation. Care was expanded through multiprofessional collaboration (psychologists, nurses, occupational therapists) to ensure a more comprehensive approach. The treatment thus came to encompass not only the child—not to “treat the mother instead of the child,” but to acknowledge that a child’s full health cannot exist without the mother’s integral health.

The outcomes of this change were deeply transformative and extended far beyond children presenting fewer clinical symptoms. Mothers who had once felt invisible—reduced to mere companions—came to occupy a legitimate place of voice and listening in the care process. For many of them, my office became a space where they could express their exhaustion, doubts, and the sense of not being able to cope. On several occasions, I mediated delicate dialogues with support networks (fathers, grandparents, caregivers) so they could understand these mothers’ needs and recognize their role as a fundamental part of child health.";"From the moment a mother is cared for, validated, and strengthened, the entire system around the child reorganizes itself. The child’s body then responds with balance and vitality. Health, therefore, comes to be understood not only as the absence of symptoms, but as the quality of presence within the bonds that sustain childhood.

In the practice of integrative medicine, the traditional biomedical model expands. The focus shifts from symptom to system. And this requires time, presence, listening, and humility from the professional—to recognize that care goes far beyond prescription.

This experience reinforces my conviction that the bodymind interface must be at the center of pediatric training. Not as a distant theory, but as part of daily practice. The medicine of the future will not only be more technological, it will also be more affective, conscious, and relational.";"mental health; health promotion; integrative pediatrics"

The program is designed for health professionals from various disciplines who seek to overcome the limitations of the reductionist biomedical model. The primary challenge addressed is the fragmentation of care, where each specialist holds only one piece of the patient's story, making a truly integrative and transdisciplinary approach difficult.

The practice is implemented in a unique pedagogical context, utilizing the Botanical Garden of São Paulo as a learning environment. Before engaging with a human case, the professionals are trained in phenomenological observation, a Goethean scientific method, using nature as a guide. They practice observing plants with openness and wonder, training their perceptive capacities to see the wholeness and dynamic processes of a living being. This initial immersion in nature serves to quiet the analytical mind and awaken a more intuitive, holistic way of seeing, which is then applied to the human context.

The methodology itself is a structured group process. Following an interview with a patient, each professional enters a meditative state and symbolically represents their perception of the patient's state through non-figurative drawings with colors and forms. This artistic piece is then passed to a colleague, who, without any prior information, writes a brief description of the person they ""see"" in the image. This process generates multiple layers of perception—intuitive, symbolic, and analytical—which converge towards a surprisingly coherent transdisciplinary diagnosis.

This final synthesis allows the team to understand complex conditions, such as hypertension, not merely as a physiological number but as a manifestation of imbalances across the patient's physical, vital, emotional, and existential dimensions. The resulting diagnosis forms the basis of a truly integrative therapeutic plan, which is shared with the patient, often sparking profound and transformative insights. This practice serves as a powerful tool for building clinical capacity and fostering a culture of deep inter-professional collaboration.";"The methodology described was developed to address several critical and interconnected problems present in integrative and multidisciplinary health practices:

    The Fragmentation and Reductionism of Patient Care: The conventional biomedical model tends to break the human being down into disconnected parts—organs, systems, and biochemical data. This reductionist view makes it difficult to perceive the patient as a whole, often leading to treatments that address isolated symptoms rather than the person's integrated reality.

    The Challenge of True Transdisciplinary Integration: Even in multidisciplinary teams, professionals from different areas often work in parallel, lacking a common language or a shared method to synthesize their diverse perspectives. This ""silo effect"" prevents the emergence of a genuinely unified diagnostic and therapeutic plan, limiting the potential of integrative care.

    The Superficiality of Conventional Diagnostic Tools: Standard diagnostic methods, heavily reliant on verbal anamnesis and objective tests, frequently fail to capture the deeper, non-verbal dimensions of illness. The symbolic, emotional, and existential meanings behind a patient's condition—the ""why"" beneath the ""what""—are often overlooked, leading to incomplete understanding and treatment.

    The Gap in Health Professionals' Training: Conventional medical and health education does not typically train professionals to use their intuition, sensitivity, and holistic perceptive capacities as valid clinical instruments. There is a lack of structured, reproducible methods to develop these skills and apply them ethically and effectively within a team setting.";"The implementation of this phenomenological methodology within the postgraduate program has yielded several consistent and significant outcomes for both the participating professionals and the individuals being assisted:

    Emergence of a Coherent Diagnostic Consensus: Despite the subjective and artistic nature of the initial step, the collection of symbolic images and written interpretations consistently converges toward a unified and surprisingly coherent diagnostic picture. The team is able to achieve a deep consensus that transcends their individual disciplinary viewpoints.

    Profound and Holistic Patient Understanding: The process enables the clinical team to move beyond surface-level symptoms and access a multi-dimensional understanding of the patient. A condition like hypertension, for example, is reframed from a mere physiological measurement to a manifestation of interconnected pressures across the patient's emotional, relational, and existential life. This holistic view directly informs the creation of a more precise and comprehensive integrative therapeutic plan.

    Transformative ""Mirror Effect"" for the Patient: Sharing the synthesized images and descriptions with the individual often produces a powerful catalytic effect. Many report profound moments of self-recognition and transformative insight, as they see their inner, often unarticulated, state reflected back to them in a symbolic and non-judgmental way.

    Development of Professional Capacities and Collaboration: For the participating health professionals, the practice has proven to be a powerful tool for developing latent clinical skills, such as intuition, holistic perception, and symbolic thinking. Furthermore, the process dismantles traditional hierarchies and fosters a culture of deep listening and genuine inter-professional collaboration.";"Key challenges include the high demand on time, incompatible with conventional healthcare productivity; the need for specific phenomenological training, limiting its scalability; and the difficulty of validation using traditional scientific metrics. Therefore, we recommend its implementation in protected-time sessions for complex cases; the inclusion of perceptual skills in health education curricula; and the development of qualitative research to formally investigate its outcomes.";"Phenomenology; Transdisciplinarity; Integrative Medicine"

The richness of the meeting, which brought together masters of ancestral knowledge and academics for a dialogue on TCIM, shows how organisational choices enhance the transformative nature of non-formal education. The seminar proved relevant to health education, addressing topics such as prevention, medicinal plants and the valorisation of different knowledge systems, in line with the Inspira 2025 Project, carried out in 34 Sesc São Paulo units.?  

  

The Social Service of Commerce, known as Sesc, operates as a private institution and has a network of more than 40 operational centres distributed throughout the state of São Paulo. Maintained by entrepreneurs in the goods, tourism and services sectors, its objective is to promote the well-being and quality of life of its employees and their families. Among its programmatic and non-formal education activities, Sesc São Paulo carries out ‘Inspira – Actions for a Healthy Life,’ dedicated to stimulating reflection on health and quality of life. In 2025, the eighth edition of the event took place in 34 Sesc São Paulo units and focused on the theme of health culture, choosing Traditional, Complementary and Integrative Medicine -TCIM as its main focus. 
On April 8 and 9, 2025, Sesc Vila Mariana became the meeting point for the Seminar ""Knowledge: Integrative and Complementary Health Practices"", an event that forms part of the schedule for the 8th edition of Sesc São Paulo's ""Inspira - Actions for Healthy Living"". The seminar was based on the knowledge that has historically shaped health culture in Brazil, valuing the ancestry present in indigenous traditions, African practices and regional knowledge. These elements were incorporated as fundamental pillars for building a broader and more plural understanding of health care. ";"The seminar highlighted the importance of strengthening knowledge and appreciation of  Traditional, Complementary and Integrative Medicine -TCIM among health professionals. At the same time, it set out to break away from the traditional lecture format, promoting spaces for listening and genuine exchanges between different forms of knowledge - ancestral, popular and scientific. The proposal went beyond the simple transmission of content: it sought to build a training experience capable of integrating diverse views on health care, broadening the cultural sensitivity and effective action of the participants. 

The process of organising this event as a whole was supported by the Health and Dentistry Management team of our institution's administration, the São Paulo Health Secretariat, and partnerships with private and public health services, universities, and researchers to publicise the activities. Attracting the public focused on prioritising the participation of health professionals, who can disseminate and use this knowledge in their professional practices, but invitations were also extended to students of permanent SESC courses, such as yoga and circle dance, for example, in addition to the spontaneous public interested in the topics. Invitations were sent to health service managers and widely publicised on the institution's social media. We emphasise that all activities were funded by our institution and offered free of charge to all interested parties.  ";"The activities related to the seminar included lectures, roundtable discussions, and physical practice classes that took place before or after the two-day seminar. The complete programme consisted of meditation experiences with 132 participants in four sessions, five sessions of mantra yoga classes with 556 participants, biodanza classes with 173 individuals, workshops on the use of medicinal plants in childhood and ageing with 53 individuals, a roundtable discussion on humanisation in birth and indigenous knowledge with 30 people, and lectures on the following topics during the two-day seminar: Reflections on lines of care in Traditional, Complementary and Integrative Medicine, a master class on the association of popular knowledge and the role of universities in disseminating knowledge,  on traditional indigenous medicine, the use of medicinal herbs and popular culture, and knowledge of terreiros with African roots, which attracted a total of over 359 participants. 

The seminar and its integrated actions provided a valuable exchange of knowledge and experiences, materializing a dynamic and enriching learning space to deepen understanding of various PICS and their applicability. The dialogical format and guest curatorship proved effective in engaging the public and stimulating critical reflection, resulting in a high potential impact on the training of health professionals. The initiative in question focused on exploring a diverse range of care, going beyond strictly conventional approaches. Ancestral knowledge was valued, such as indigenous medicine and African traditions, as well as interaction with the ecosystem and the healing potential of plants. The primary objective was to demonstrate how these practices can be integrated into the current health system, promoting a comprehensive care perspective, expanding the therapeutic arsenal and strengthening each person's ability to manage their own health and well-being.";"Coordination between educational institutions, health services and cultural organizations is an essential pillar for ensuring the success and continuity of initiatives like this. We encourage the reproduction of events such as the ""Knowledge Seminar"" as a tool for continuing education in Traditional, Complementary and Integrative Medicine -TCIM, whenever possible combining relevant content with participatory methodologies. The value of planning centered on the participant's experience is also highlighted, favoring the exchange of knowledge and dialogue between different cultures. Finally, discussions in all practical and theoretical activities reinforced the need to understand and value traditional knowledge, which is often underestimated and devalued, and the importance of debating these forms of care within research centres and health services, and bringing indigenous peoples, communities and other holders of this knowledge to the forefront of this movement.

The proposal goes beyond the traditional concept of self-care, exploring a holistic and multidimensional view of health, especially designed for health care practitioners.

The course covers evidence-based health practices, providing participants with solid knowledge for making conscious choices. A central pillar is the exploration of the Self-Care Canvas, a practical and innovative tool that guides participants through a structured process of self-knowledge and action. This Canvas involves 4 stages: 1) Finding needs, 2) Embracing emotions and sensations, 3) Moving towards healthy habits, and 4) beginning Again after challenges.";"The ""Self-Care and Integral Health"" course's objectives include: 
Promoting awareness about the importance of self-care in daily life.
Providing practical tools and strategies for participants to incorporate self-care into their routines.
Encouraging the pursuit of integral health, encompassing physical, mental, emotional, and social aspects.

The 10-virtual class course is a transformative learning experience. It equips participants with the knowledge and tools needed to cultivate a more balanced and healthy life by addressing common challenges and empowering them with autonomy and a proactive role in their own self-care journey. It explores concepts of health, care, and disease, evidence and research concerning TCIM, self-knowledge and meditation practices.";"There has been three editions of the Self-care and Integral health course (2021, 2022 and 2023). Overall we received 750 inscriptions and the classes were offered through the Google Classroom in the second semester of each year. 
Regarding the Self-Care Canvas, we collected and analyzed 108 responses between October 2022 and December 2024. The respondents' average age was 40, ranging from 18 to 65 years old. Our analysis allowed us to group responses for each stage of the FEMA Method: 1) Find, 2) Embrace, 3) Move, and 4) Again. Here’s a breakdown of the grouped responses:
In the Find stage, guiding questions for filling out the Canvas include: ""Which feelings, emotions, or illnesses do I want to address?"", ""Which professionals, models, and health practices can help me?"", and ""Which processes or strategies don't seem to work?"" Consequently, the most frequently addressed themes were related to mental health, with a strong emphasis on anxiety, therapy, meditation, and the search for professionals and practices to manage emotions and feelings. 
Following, the ""Embrace"" stage guides participants to delve deeper into their experiences. The key questions for filling out the Canvas at this point are: ""What are the meanings of this situation in my life?"", ""What are the limitations of this situation?"", and ""What are the opportunities within this situation?"" From the responses, we systematically categorized the mentioned limitations and opportunities into thematic groups for clearer visualization and understanding. The responses related to the Limitations Group were as follows: Emotional Challenges, Time and Energy Management, Mental and Physical Health, Professional and Personal Limitations, Relationship Challenges, Financial and Professional Challenges, Health and Well-being Challenges and Self-Care Challenges. 
Among the opportunities identified by participants in this stage, the following themes emerged: Personal Growth, Routine Improvement
Self-knowledge and Health, Achievement and Duty Fulfilled, Relationships and Communication, Professional Opportunities, Motivation and Well-being, Self-care and Acceptance. 
The third stage of the Self-Care Canvas, ""Move,"" guides participants toward actionable change. The key questions for this section include: ""What changes can help me reach my goal?"", ""What are the possible solutions for the identified situations?"", and ""How can I measure the impact of the changes I should implement?"" From the responses, we were able to group the objectives for change, possible solutions, and the anticipated impacts of these changes. Here are some illustrative examples:
1. Personal Improvement and Health
Objectives: Getting life back on track, returning to studies, improving diet quality.
Solutions: Engaging in self-care practices and health interventions such as meditation, physical activity, therapy, and healthy eating.
Impacts: Enhanced well-being and self-awareness, including observing mood, energy levels, feelings of reward, and a decrease in anxiety.
2. Emotional and Relational Development
Objectives: Accepting changes, reducing self-criticism, improving relationships.
Solutions: Practicing emotional development and open communication through self-control, self-knowledge, and direct communication.
Impacts: Greater emotional and relational growth, including deeper self-knowledge, recognizing accomplishments, and fostering better relationships.
3. Mental and Physical Health
Objectives: Reducing workload, prioritizing mental and physical well-being.
Solutions: Achieving a better work-life balance by incorporating more rest, intentional self-care for mind and body, and adopting a ""slow-down"" approach to life.
Impacts: Greater overall balance and improved mental health, observable through changes in energy levels, sleep quality, and emotional state. 
Finally in the last stage, ""Again"", the results reveal that achieving self-care goals is associated with a range of improvements in physical and mental well-being, such as quality sleep, increased energy, emotional balance (patience, serenity, reduced anxiety), improved physical health (including hormonal regulation), greater confidence, and enjoyment from hobbies and accomplishments. Conversely, signs of a ""new cycle restart"" or imbalance include negative feelings like unhappiness, impatience, frustration, excessive fatigue, irritation, lack of motivation, and the recurrence of mental or physical health issues, indicating the need to re-evaluate and adjust self-care strategies.";"The ""Self-Care and Integral Health"" course offers a transformative learning experience, equipping participants with the knowledge and tools needed to cultivate a more balanced and healthy life by emphasizing autonomy and a proactive role in their own well-being. 
Healthcare professionals should be encouraged to apply and improve Self-care strategies as the Self-care Canvas regularly, not just during periods of training. Consistent engagement fosters self-awareness, helping them proactively identify needs and adjust strategies before burnout sets in. This cultivates a habit of mindful self-assessment. While deeply personal, the Canvas can be highly effective in group settings and can be proposed to patients, broadening the assistance. Facilitated workshops can provide a safe space for healthcare professionals to share insights, discuss challenges, and learn from peers. This collaborative environment reinforces that self-care is a shared responsibility and builds a supportive community, reducing feelings of isolation.";"Self-Care; evidence-based practice; Professional Training"

In 2025, the guiding theme of the actions was Integrative and Complementary Health Practices (ICPHPs), and before the project's activities began in 34 different units in the state of São Paulo, the Seminar ” Saberes” was held, which brought important dialogues about ancestral practices, traditional integration with conventional treatments and reflections on various therapeutic forms recognized by the World Health Organization (WHO), with a focus on primarily reaching health professionals from different services and the institution's health programmers. 

Sesc is recognized for its wide-ranging service of promoting socio-educational activities related to the well-being and quality of life of commercial workers and their families, as well as expanding these activities to the general population.? For some years now, the institution has taken a cross-cutting approach to Pics in its occasional and permanent actions, with an emphasis on various body practices such as yoga, circular dance and oriental Chinese practices, but it also offers courses on medicinal plants, indigenous and African matrix knowledge, as well as evidence-based scientific knowledge, in the form of lectures, workshops and conversation circles, for example. These activities are aimed at visitors to the units and sometimes a specific audience profile is also sought.?";"The Seminar was planned based on logistical support and partnerships between public and private health institutions, universities and SESC, also with the institutional support of BIREME-OPAS. The Vila Mariana Unit team created a strategy of dialog between these partners to define the formats of the actions, the target audience, and the best strategy for broad participation by health professionals, students and SESC professionals. After organizing the flow of vacancies and active search, we had the effective participation of large Social Organizations (OS's) operating in the public and private sectors in the city of São Paulo, hospital networks affiliated to the Sindicato das Santas Casas de Misericórdia and philanthropic hospitals in the state of São Paulo, students from public universities, as well as the institution's employees and the population interested in the topics. The Seminar and all the training, practices and actions related to the project were offered free of charge, expanding the possibility of participants and access for individuals from different socio-economic classe , with the entire investment paid for by Sesc SP. 

?In particular, the event highlighted traditional knowledge linked to indigenous medicine, the use of medicinal plants and practices of African origin, presented by masters of knowledge and important researchers of PICs in Brazil. Reflections were also promoted on mapping these practices in public health services, the interface between traditional knowledge and its teaching in universities, and the construction of a virtual library of traditional medicine covering five continents. Over the course of three weeks, the public was also able to take part in workshops, open classes and lectures related to these themes.";"We had 501 people register for the seminar and 147 people for the other activities offered at the Vila Mariana unit. The seminar was effectively attended by 364 people over the two days of activities. Of these participants, we counted 69 Sesc São Paulo professionals, from 25 of the institution's units, the vast majority being in the city of São Paulo, but reaching a total of 12 cities with operational units. In our registration search, we identified 97 professionals working directly in services related to Social Organizations (OS) and public sectors, and these professionals work in 7 different cities, covering hospitals, outpatient clinics, specialty centers, primary care and regional health coordinators. The number of professionals working in the eastern and southern regions of the city of São Paulo stands out, working in 41 different health establishments, but data was observed from participants working in all regions of the city, including the expanded center, and the western and northern regions. 	In our statistical system, we observed that the online registrants, who represent 326 individuals, are 82% women and 91% of the participants are workers accredited to our institution, 100% of whom have a university degree. This data reflects the importance of attracting this audience for educational actions and maintaining this relationship that provides professionals with the opportunity to learn and exchange knowledge at no cost and in a democratic way.";The large turnout of professionals shows that we have achieved our goal of broadening knowledge about PICs. Throughout the days of the event, we reinforced our commitment to providing up-to-date, quality information that directly affects those who work with and take this knowledge to different services and communities. Although PICs are widely discussed in health services, at Sesc and some research and teaching institutions, we emphasize that it is of the utmost importance to train more and more people, in order to democratize the applicability of PICs to the entire population. Giving access to knowledge also reinforces the importance of our institutional values related to the breadth of culture and knowledge for all.;"popular health knowledge; Health Professionals; dialogues"

Although self-limiting, the condition may persist for several months and spread through direct contact, causing aesthetic discomfort, itching, and risk of secondary bacterial infections. Despite the possibility of spontaneous regression, treatment is essential due to the social and psychological impact caused by the widespread presence of lesions in children.
Conventional therapeutic options, such as curettage, cryotherapy, and topical application of 10% potassium hydroxide, have limitations regarding tolerability and adherence, especially in young children (Can et al., 2004).
The protocol adopted in this case was inspired by the clinical study conducted by Markum & Baillie (2012), which evaluated the effectiveness of combining Melaleuca alternifolia essential oil and iodine in the treatment of molluscum contagiosum in children. Adapting this proposal to complementary clinical practice, we also chose to associate the use of therapeutic crystalline silicon patches, applied directly to the lesion, with the aim of facilitating the partial mechanical extraction of the papular content. This combined approach aimed to promote lesion regression in a safe, non-invasive, and more tolerable way for the child.
In line with the theme Complementary and Integrative Practices Across the Lifespan, this experience report aims to describe the use of Melaleuca alternifolia essential oil, in association with iodine solution and silicon patch application, as an integrative approach to the treatment of molluscum contagiosum in a school-aged child.";"The patient, a female child aged 8, presented with approximately 40 molluscum contagiosum lesions, mainly distributed on the abdomen, elbows, and inner thighs. Some papules were inflamed, especially in the area of friction between the thighs, showing signs of erythema and mild pain on palpation. The lesions had a typical morphology—umbilicated papules with a pinkish or whitish appearance—and had been progressively spreading over the previous weeks. It was evident during clinical evaluation that lesion proliferation was occurring through direct contact between body areas, such as the repeated contact of the elbows with the inner thighs, suggesting viral autoinoculation facilitated by constant itching and friction.
The patient had a prior diagnosis of atopic dermatitis, a condition that compromises the integrity of the skin barrier and is associated with increased susceptibility to viral skin infections, including more extensive and persistent forms of molluscum contagiosum (Silverberg, 2003; Nascimento et al., 2011).
The main complaint from the caregivers was the aesthetic discomfort and persistent itching, which interfered with the child’s routine, causing embarrassment in school environments and difficulty participating in physical activities with other children. Despite some inflamed lesions, no clinical signs of secondary bacterial infection were observed.
The aromatherapeutic protocol was developed based on the child’s age and clinical condition. Initially, topical application of an iodine solution was performed, followed by direct application of pure Melaleuca alternifolia (tea tree) essential oil, restricted to the skin lesions, twice a day. From the fourth day on, with clinical observation that some papules showed signs of imminent rupture, therapeutic crystalline silicon patches were introduced—tools commonly used in integrative practices such as needle-free acupuncture. The patches were applied to the most prominent lesions, aiming to promote mechanical drainage of their contents in a non-invasive manner. After 24 hours, the patches were removed, and the topical protocol was reapplied, initiating a new cycle of observation and care.
This protocol was based on the randomized clinical trial by Markum & Baillie (2012), in which 53 children received topical treatment twice daily with a combination of Melaleuca oil and iodine (TTO-I). After 30 days, 16 out of 19 children (84%) in the TTO-I group showed more than 90% reduction in lesion count, compared to only 3 out of 18 (17%) in the Melaleuca-only group and 1 out of 16 (6%) in the iodine-only group.
Furthermore, Melaleuca alternifolia essential oil contains terpinen?4?ol, its main bioactive compound, which has demonstrated antiviral, antibacterial, antifungal, and anti-inflammatory properties. In vitro studies indicate that it may disrupt viral membranes and suppress inflammatory mediators such as TNF??, IL?1?, IL?8, and PGE?, supporting its clinical use in skin infections (Hammer et al., 2006).";"The child showed good adherence to the protocol, and no cutaneous or systemic adverse reactions were observed during follow-up.
 By the end of two weeks, a significant reduction in the number of active lesions was observed, with complete elimination of the lesions and no appearance of new affected areas.
The combined protocol proved to be safe, well-tolerated, and potentially effective as a complementary approach to the management of molluscum contagiosum in children.
No adverse effects were observed with the topical use of undiluted tea tree oil on intact skin, in small amounts and limited to the lesion area. The patient was closely monitored throughout the process, and given her age, the decision to use the essential oil in its pure form was clinically justified. This suggests good safety when applied with professional judgment in pediatric populations.";"This report reinforces the potential of clinical aromatherapy as a complementary integrative practice in the management of self-limiting viral dermatoses in children. The combination of gentle and well-tolerated approaches can provide comfort, reduce the duration of lesion progression, and improve the experience of the child and family when facing a prolonged dermatological condition.
Such integrative strategies may be particularly useful when conventional treatments are not feasible or accepted, reinforcing the need for interdisciplinary collaboration in pediatric dermatological care.
However, case reports do not allow for generalizations, and there is a clear need for controlled clinical studies with larger samples to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of essential oil interventions in pediatric populations. The lack of validated tools for the objective measurement of symptoms such as itching, discomfort, or psychosocial impact remains a challenge in aromatherapy research. The incorporation of more standardized clinical protocols, such as the TREATS checklist proposed by the Aromatic Research Quality Appraisal Taskforce (ARQAT), may contribute to greater methodological transparency and scientific rigor in future studies.";"Molluscum Contagiosum; aromatherapy; Melaleuca; children"

1 of the Health Law - which defines medical personnel and health personnel as having to be 
college graduates, because this definition is considered detrimental to traditional practitioners.
The trial process has been going on from July 2024 to January 2025. Starting from the 
preliminary hearing, to hear the advice of the panel of judges. Then continued with the trial to 
hear the government's response, represented by the general secretary of the ministry of health. 
Hearing the parliament's response, represented by the head of the health commission. As well 
as hearing the statements of witnesses from the government.
The trial was conducted openly to the public and broadcast live. I presented evidence, some of 
which was only allowed to be seen by the panel of judges, because ethically - the identity and 
images of the client's genitals must be kept private.";"According to Indonesian law, invasive procedures may only be performed by medical / health 
personnel, and only college graduates can be recognized as medical / health personnel. In 
short, other than college graduates are prohibited from performing invasive procedures.
Circumcision is the removal of prepuce by circular incision. Sunat is the removal of the kulup
(prepuce / preputium) with or without circumcision. An example of sunat without circumcision is 
bogem or lipet, where the skin is folded back. Another example of sunat without circumcision is 
gusaran, where the prepuce is only scratched. Circumcision is performed on males, while sunat
is performed on both males or females. Circumcision was popularized to modern medicine by 
Dr. Jonathan Hutchinson, while sunat has been carried out since ancient times. Circumcision is 
performed for health reasons, while sunat is performed for reasons of tradition and belief.
Circumcision (based on medical diagnosis) is covered by the Indonesian health insurance 
program, while sunat (for traditional purposes) is not covered. Translating sunat as 
circumcision, only textually, has negative impacts on natives.
In addition to invasive practices, much traditional knowledge was banned to extinction, because 
it was considered unscientific at the time. An example is hypnosis, known in Indonesia as 
gendam.
";"The Court accepted my legal standing, so that in jurisprudence I became the first sunat expert 
in Indonesia. The Court rejected all requests and decided to maintain the law. However, in the a 
quo decision, the Court emphasized to the Government in casu the Ministry of Health, not to 
prohibit the practice of sunat experts and to provide free education at the tertiary level, so that 
natives and their knowledge can be included in the national health system.
Parliament admitted that they had overlooked sunat experts when discussing the health bill. 
They promised that no one would lose their jobs, by encouraging the health minister to make 
implementing regulations that accommodate natives [Minutes of the Court - Session VI no 92]

.
The decision of the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Indonesia, verdict and ratio 
decidendi, is final and binding, and is valid from the moment it is pronounced. However, until 
now, the Ministry of Health remains adamant that sunat (textually translated as circumcision) 
may only be performed by doctors, and does not provide education as mandated by the 
Constitutional Court, and reject the proposed circumciser competency standards.";"The decision of the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Indonesia is a reverse approach taken 
for the sake of justice. Usually integrative medicine is initiated by academics, who acquire 
native knowledge for free. Now, academics are required to share what they have, to natives for 
free. This decision can be imitated to overcome the latent conflict between academics and 
natives";"Circumcision; Sunat; Integrative Medicine; Native knowledge; Indonesia"

La Paz, situated at an altitude of approximately 3,650 meters (11,975 feet), is Bolivia's administrative capital and a dynamic urban center characterized by rich cultural diversity, significant indigenous populations, and distinct socioeconomic divisions. The city serves as an essential location for observing the interactions and integration processes between traditional, complementary, and conventional biomedical practices.
During the practicum, information was systematically gathered through direct observations in various healthcare settings, including both private and public clinics and hospitals across La Paz. Observational sites included Hospital de Clínicas (public), Clinica Alemana (private), and smaller community-based clinics, enabling a comprehensive understanding of healthcare delivery across different organizational frameworks. Additionally, structured conversations and informal dialogues were held with diverse healthcare providers, including conventional medical doctors, natural medicine practitioners, and traditional indigenous healers. These interactions aimed to understand the nuances of collaborative practice, barriers to integration, patient perceptions, and institutional support for traditional and integrative medicine practices within Bolivia’s pluralistic healthcare landscape.";"Several interrelated challenges emerged throughout the practicum regarding the implementation of policies and practices aimed at integrating traditional Bolivian medicine into the national healthcare system. Although Bolivia's Universal Health System (SUS) legally supports the inclusion of traditional and natural medicine, the practical implementation of these laws remains inconsistent. Many traditional healers and natural medicines are not covered by SUS, making them inaccessible through formal healthcare channels and often limiting their use to out-of-pocket or community-based contexts.
In many families, particularly those from indigenous or lower socioeconomic backgrounds, traditional remedies are often the first line of care—used at home or accessed through local healers—before seeking treatment at hospitals or clinics. This pattern reflects cultural preferences, economic considerations, and sometimes distrust or perceived inaccessibility of the formal medical system.
Despite growing recognition of the importance of traditional medicine for increasing healthcare access and fostering cultural responsiveness, there remains a lack of clear regulation regarding the training, credentialing, and oversight of traditional healers and naturopathic doctors. This regulatory ambiguity complicates efforts to formally integrate these practitioners into the conventional system, hindering interprofessional collaboration and raising questions about quality assurance and patient safety.";;The disconnect between policy and practice, compounded by limited institutional support and fragmented referral systems, highlights the need for more robust implementation strategies, greater resource allocation, and deeper engagement with local communities and traditional practitioners. Without addressing these systemic barriers, the potential benefits of a truly integrative healthcare model remain difficult to realize in Bolivia's evolving health landscape.;"healthcare integration; health systems; traditional medicine; Bolivia's Universal healthcare (SUS); "

Ghana, a regional leader in health and education policy, has a structured technical and vocational education system under the Commission for TVET. However, prior to this initiative, there were no accredited naturopathy training pathways or occupational standards. Most practitioners operated informally, and traditional medicine stakeholders expressed skepticism toward naturopathy. To address this, I led the development of Ghana’s first National Occupational Standards and Competency-Based Training (CBT) curricula for naturopathy, ranging from National Proficiency to BTech levels. These interventions formally embedded naturopathy into the national education system, aligning it with global standards while respecting African healing values.

In The Gambia, traditional medicine is culturally embedded but lacked legal or educational structures. As Legal Director of the Traditional Healers Association (TRAHASS), I supported the integration of healers into the health system through clinical training partnerships with Ahmadiyya Muslim Hospital and policy engagement with the Ministry of Health. This work contributed to drafting The Gambia’s first TCIM Bill, aiming to provide legal recognition and regulatory frameworks for practitioners.

To ease tensions between traditional healers and naturopaths in Ghana, a two-tier licensing model was introduced: Registered Naturopaths (RNP) and Doctors of Naturopathy (ND/Dr(Nat)). Additionally, the Naturo-Herbal model, blending naturopathy with African herbalism, was adopted to promote unity and curriculum integration.

Both countries face rising chronic diseases and strained biomedical systems. This project responds by formalizing TCIM through education, legal reform, and cultural innovation—offering a scalable model for African health sovereignty and sustainable development.";"Despite the widespread use of Traditional, Complementary, and Integrative Medicine (TCIM) across Africa, particularly naturopathy, there remains a significant gap in its formal recognition, regulation, and integration into national education and health systems. Naturopathy has often been misunderstood, marginalized, or lumped together with unregulated traditional practices, leading to confusion, professional conflict, and lack of trust among regulators, medical professionals, and the public.

In Ghana, the absence of accredited training pathways, clear licensure categories, and legal definitions created a situation where practitioners operated without formal recognition, often facing professional isolation. Similarly, in The Gambia, although traditional medicine is widely practiced and accepted by the public, there was no legal framework to support its practitioners or define their roles within the broader healthcare system. This regulatory vacuum resulted in missed opportunities for integration, clinical collaboration, and patient safety.

Furthermore, regulatory authorities lacked the technical expertise to evaluate naturopathic or TCIM curricula, and many accreditation bodies operated under biomedical biases that discounted indigenous knowledge systems. In addition, there was growing tension between traditional medicine practitioners and emerging naturopaths, particularly in Ghana, where the introduction of naturopathy was perceived as a threat to long-standing traditional healing systems.

Without standardized training, licensure systems, legal backing, and mutual recognition among practitioners, the field of naturopathy in Africa risked fragmentation, exclusion from national health strategies, and the erosion of indigenous healing knowledge.

This report addresses these challenges by presenting a comprehensive strategy for legitimizing naturopathy through competency-based education, inclusive legal reform, and culturally responsive innovation, such as the introduction of the Naturo-Herbal model.";"Outcomes and Achievements
•	Educational Reform in Ghana: CBT-aligned naturopathy qualifications from NP to BTech are now formally recognized under CTVET.
•	Policy Milestones in The Gambia: The TCIM bill is under development, and traditional healers now have access to clinical training.
•	Institutional Partnerships: Collaborations between hospitals and traditional healers have been piloted successfully.
•	Professional Harmony: The Naturo-Herbal model has improved cooperation and reduced resistance between naturopaths and herbalists.";"Recommendations
Based on practical experiences in Ghana and The Gambia, the following recommendations are proposed to support the effective institutionalization of Traditional, Complementary, and Integrative Medicine (TCIM), particularly naturopathy, across Africa and other LMICs:

Develop National TCIM Policies and Legislation:
Governments should prioritize the formulation of national TCIM policies and legal frameworks that recognize diverse practitioner categories, protect indigenous healing systems, and ensure professional accountability through regulation.

Integrate TCIM into National TVET Systems:
Ministries of Health, Education, and TVET authorities should collaborate to embed TCIM disciplines like naturopathy into technical and vocational systems through standardized, competency-based curricula aligned with global benchmarks but rooted in African traditions.

Establish Inclusive Licensing Frameworks:
Countries should adopt two-tier licensing systems that differentiate between traditional healers with indigenous training and formally educated naturopaths (e.g., Registered Naturopath and Doctor of Naturopathy). This promotes equity, inclusion, and professional respect.

Create a Separate Accreditation Framework for TCIM Education:
To address the limitations of biomedical-centric accreditation agencies, a dedicated TCIM accreditation body or unit should be established within national or regional quality assurance systems. This framework must be staffed with TCIM experts and recognize indigenous epistemologies, practical competencies, and culturally relevant pedagogies.

Promote Regional Harmonization of Standards:
Continental and regional bodies (e.g., African Union, ECOWAS) should support the creation of a Pan-African TCIM Curriculum Validation Council to facilitate mutual recognition of TCIM qualifications, practitioner mobility, and cross-border program alignment.

Support Capacity Building for Regulators:
Governments should fund the training of accreditation boards, policy officers, and regulatory bodies to assess TCIM programs, understand traditional knowledge systems, and evaluate integrative curricula objectively.

Facilitate South–South Knowledge Exchange:
Successful models such as Ghana’s CBT-based framework and The Gambia’s clinical integration of traditional healers should be documented and adapted across the Global South through regional exchange platforms.

Mobilize Public and Donor Funding for TCIM Development:
Establish national and donor-supported funding mechanisms to develop TCIM institutions, public awareness campaigns, practitioner development, and research in naturopathy and indigenous healing.";"naturopathy; Africa; Competency-Based Training; traditional medicine; TVET"

Each year, a curricular internship in PICS is offered to four health residency programs: the Multidisciplinary Residency in Family Health, the Family and Community Medicine Residency, the Uniprofessional Nursing Residency in Primary Health Care (both from the SMS Public Health School), and the Multidisciplinary Residency in Family Health from the Federal University of Santa Catarina (UFSC). Approximately 120 residents—including physicians, nurses, physical education professionals, nutritionists, dentists, pharmacists, physical therapists, psychologists, and social workers—complete this mandatory internship as part of their training curriculum.

With a 50-hour workload, the internship is conducted in partnership with UFSC, the Agricultural Research and Rural Extension Company of Santa Catarina (EPAGRI), and the Environmental Secretariat. A diverse group of professionals with specific expertise, including coordinators from the four residency programs and CPIC members, participate in delivering the internship, mobilizing around 30 instructors with a shared commitment to making the internship a unique and transformative health education experience.

The internship aims to provide a broadened and interdisciplinary education for health professionals, encourage critical reflection on medical rationalities in PICS, and promote a comprehensive understanding of the health-disease process. Residents have the opportunity to experience a variety of practices while also gaining essential theoretical knowledge to support such care.
The program seeks to equip participants with the tools for the safe and effective use of medicinal and herbal plants, including pharmacological, botanical, ecological, and agronomic aspects, with an emphasis on species most commonly used by the local population. It also aims to promote the cultivation and use of Unconventional Food Plants (PANCs) as a strategy for food and nutritional security, encouraging sustainable practices in home, community, and institutional gardens. The training fosters the development of intersectoral projects, the strengthening of collaborative networks, and an understanding of the socio-environmental determinants of health, aligning with the principles of planetary health. Additional topics include solid waste management, mitigation of climate change impacts, and encouragement of scientific research to develop innovative and sustainable alternatives within Brazil’s Unified Health System (SUS).

In 2025, the internship was restructured into two blocks:
Block 1 – Integrative and Complementary Practices (PICS)
Block 2 – Urban Agriculture and Planetary Health

The first block included both theoretical and practical sessions, with hands-on experiences in practices such as Meditation, Body Practices, Circle Dance, Lian Gong, Qi Gong, Integrative Community Therapy, Aromatherapy, Extraction Methods, Auriculotherapy, Introduction to Medicinal Cannabis, and Introduction to Herbal Medicine—featuring medicinal plants and herbal remedies with a focus on those most commonly used by the Florianópolis population.

In the second block, residents explored the therapeutic potential of activities like park walks, gardening, and working in greenhouses and cultivation spaces. They learned plant propagation techniques, bed management, and methods of syntropic agriculture, and participated in workshops on PANC-based cooking and composting of organic waste.

This internship approach emphasizes collaboration across institutional networks, aiming for synergy through coordinated actions within public health education policies.";The internship serves as a training strategy to address the lack of content on PICS, Planetary Health, and Urban Agriculture in the education of Family Health professionals, as well as the limited availability of these practices within SUS services, which restricts public access to such therapeutic approaches.;"At the end of the 2025 internship, residents received evaluation forms for both blocks. The forms included questions on self-assessment, structure and organization, relevance of topics, and performance of the instructors, with response options being “Excellent,” “Satisfactory,” “Fair,” “Poor,” or “Not Applicable,” as well as space for comments, criticism, and suggestions.

For the PICS block, 48 responses were received. Of those:
85.5% rated the overall internship experience as “Excellent” or “Satisfactory”;
84.95% rated the topic relevance as “Excellent” or “Satisfactory”;
84.26% rated instructor performance as “Excellent” or “Satisfactory.”

For the Urban Agriculture and Planetary Health block, 31 responses were received, with:
100% rating the overall experience as “Excellent” or “Satisfactory”;
96.37% rating the topic relevance as “Excellent” or “Satisfactory”;
99.19% rating instructor performance as “Excellent” or “Satisfactory.”";"Implementing the internship presented several challenges that required ongoing adaptation by the organizing team and the residents. One key issue was the availability of suitable rooms, as institutional scheduling and infrastructure did not always meet the specific requirements of proposed activities—particularly for movement-based practices like bodywork and circle dancing.

Another challenge was securing the release of instructors from their daily duties, especially given workforce shortages and the limited number of professionals within the municipal network trained in PICS, Urban Agriculture, and Planetary Health. This was further complicated by financial constraints, which limited the ability to compensate external specialists and to purchase materials or expand practical experiences—necessitating creativity and resourcefulness.

Additionally, incorporating content from non-hegemonic health rationalities proved difficult for residents with little practical exposure or whose professional education was predominantly grounded in biomedical paradigms. This led to questions about scientific legitimacy, often influenced by stigma and bias against alternative medical frameworks.";"Integrative and complementary health practices; Urban Agriculture; Planetary Health; Internship and Residency; Non-Medical Internship"

Through this program, the City Hall advances planetary health by aligning sustainable school food procurement with educational processes. It highlights the centrality of food systems (DECLARATION, 2021), institutionalizing a Food and Nutrition Education (FNE) curriculum in elementary education (SÃO PAULO, 2024) and aligning it with the lens of planetary health, given their complementarity (CARVALHO et al., 2024; LAHAM et al., 2024). The 2024 objectives, in the program’s first year, focused on participant engagement: 1) 50 farmers and 2) 332 schools, aiming to involve up to 50,000 students. Launched via Public Notice No. 01/SME/CODAE/2023, the program promotes educational visits for 11–12-year-old students to gardens and parks in urban and rural areas of the city, offering meals and food kits with local produce. The civil society organization CREN – Center for Recovery and Nutrition Education – is responsible for technical assistance: nutrition and farmer support, and educational assistance for teachers. These services are considered engagement strategies and were developed and implemented by CREN. For farmers, a course on good food handling practices was offered, supporting the preparation of food kits and meals. For educators, an eBook was presented on how to pedagogically engage with the experience. As an evaluation method, the program prioritized internal process documentation via control forms, enabling the consolidation of implementation data for both schools and farmers. All participants were asked to consent to data sharing before engaging in activities.";"Specific challenges for engagement included: 1) short time frame for training before the first student visits; 2) unforeseen issues such as weather, parental authorization, and internal motivation, which led to the cancellation of some visits. Broader challenges included implementing the program during a municipal election year, which brought legal restrictions on institutional communication and hindered communication with schools and stakeholders. Interdepartmental governance also faced difficulties in fully achieving intersectoral collaboration among different municipal secretariats.";"In 2024, the program engaged: 1) 69 farmers, producing 15,569 meals and 18,211 agroecological food kits, all in line with food supply parameters; 2) 22,221 students from 325 schools, involving up to 1,495 educators. These results indicate strong adherence to the goals: the target of engaging 50 farmers was exceeded by 38%; the target of 332 schools was 97.9% met.";"For the first objective, engaging farmers through the good practices course, we recommend: i) expanding the course to more regional hubs; ii) offering it remotely; and iii) maintaining ongoing course availability regardless of the school calendar. Regarding the second objective, focused on schools, the material was considered punctual; a broader initiative is recommended in the form of a course for teachers, emphasizing the interdisciplinary nature of FNE — encouraging teachers from various subjects to engage with the Rolê Agroecológico program. Looking forward, with the operational procedures already established in 2024, the program aims to expand its targets for farmers and schools and support the evaluation of developing psychometric indicators. Contributions to the field include not only the implementation of an interdepartmental and intersectoral collaboration model for food system sustainability — by reconnecting schools with their territories — but also the development of evaluation metrics that consider the multiple determinants of planetary health, such as food and nutrition security, ecological resilience, and social equity, highlighting the cross-cutting integration between FNE and the planetary health perspective.";"Food Systems; Agroecology; School Feeding; Food and Nutrition Education; Planetary Health Education"

Rooted in the PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act) cycle and adapted from ISO 9001 quality parameters, the protocol incorporates concepts from the Transtheoretical Model of Behavior Change (Prochaska & DiClemente), expressive writing, neurolinguistics, and improvement science. It has been implemented with over 360 participants—primarily women—who experience high emotional demands, sensory overload, and fragmented routines.

The methodology emerged in 2020, when the author—after more than a decade as a corporate executive in the field of quality management and people development, leading multidisciplinary teams of over 200 professionals—transitioned careers and applied continuous improvement principles to her own life to recover from burnout and infertility. From this intersection of high-performance expertise and lived vulnerability, a structured and accessible method was born, integrating technical rigor with human depth. PCP Conexões reframes the classic PDCA logic from an organizational tool into a personal, sensory, and emotional transformation model.

The protocol moves away from masculine, linear models (such as the “21-day Hero’s Journey”) and embraces the cyclical, intuitive, and sensory dynamics of feminine routines—especially relevant in domestic, caregiving, and multitasking contexts. It respects individual rhythms while promoting consistent action through small, daily practices.

Participants engage with daily prompts (via video, text, or workbook) designed to foster internal listening, self-awareness, and embodied presence. Each day includes a short written reflection (approx. 15 minutes), helping them formulate personal micro-commitments and gradually shift their behavior. No previous training or advanced education is required—just basic literacy and openness to self-observation.

Designed as a light social technology, the protocol can be implemented in a range of contexts: community health programs, public schools, women's shelters, corporate well-being initiatives, and mental health services. Its low-cost, scalable nature and language accessibility make it a strong candidate for application within Brazil’s Unified Health System (SUS), especially through trained facilitators or community health agents.";"- Low adherence to lifestyle change programs due to lack of personalization and emotional support.
- High rates of burnout, anxiety, and insomnia related to disorganized routines and sensory overload.
- Overload of women in caregiving roles with no structured time or tools for self-care.
- Scarcity of accessible, low-cost methodologies for behavior change in public health systems.
- Difficulty sustaining health-related commitments without external pressure or clinical supervision.
- Fragmentation between technical interventions and lived experience, especially in underserved communities.";"The PCP Conexões protocol has had over 360 participations across 18 guided editions, with several individuals choosing to repeat the experience in different life contexts. Each cycle represents a structured journey of habit transformation, grounded in daily reflection and embodied practice. More than 80% of participants report continuing the protocol's routines after the initial 25-day experience.

Key outcomes include:

- Adoption of regular physical activity after years of inactivity.
- Elimination of up to 14kg in weight without restrictive diets.
- Recovery of healthy sleep patterns and reduction of anxiety symptoms.
- Return to professional and academic activities after emotional exhaustion or caregiving burnout.
- Strengthened decision-making, self-regulation, and time organization.
- Increased emotional clarity, autonomy, and sustainable self-care practices.
- The protocol has proven especially effective for individuals without access to therapy or structured programs, particularly women managing multiple responsibilities in emotionally demanding environments.";"Recommendations:

- Pilot the protocol in Primary Health Units through trained community health agents or facilitators.
- Integrate the protocol into mental health and health promotion programs, particularly for women in vulnerable situations.
- Use the workbook and daily materials as low-cost educational tools to encourage autonomy and continuity.
- Promote facilitator training among professionals in education, public health, and social services to expand reach.

Challenges:

- Institutional resistance to hybrid methodologies that combine scientific structure with subjectivity and sensory practices.
- Scaling the protocol while maintaining depth and personalization.
- Overcoming cultural paradigms around how habits are formed and sustained, especially in overburdened populations.
- Ensuring continuous follow-up without clinical dependence or complex infrastructure.";"Habit change; Health self-management; PDCA for People"

Developed at USP's Ribeirão Preto School of Nursing (EERP-USP), the project works to promote the physical, emotional, mental and spiritual health of the academic community and the external population, through individualized care, workshops, partnerships and participation in events. Reiki, officially recognized by SUS since 2017, is a holistic therapeutic practice that promotes energy balance through the natural stimulation of intrinsic mechanisms for rehabilitation or maintenance of multidimensional health. Considered safe and effective as a complementary therapy, it has been gaining increasing acceptance in Brazil and other countries, especially in hospital settings. The initiative is in line with WHO guidelines, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the National Policy for Integrative and Complementary Practices (PNPIC), although it still faces structural challenges to its consolidation in the health system and in professional training curricula. 
The project carries out workshops, consultations and partnerships, promoting stress reduction and improving the quality of life of participants. The Reiki sessions take place at EERP/USP, in the Ligiê Laboratory, a sensory environment prepared for integrative practices, and are conducted by certified Reiki practitioners made up of students, teachers and administrative staff. In addition to individual consultations, the
project carries out educational and publicity activities on social networks and at academic and community events. 
";" The project responds to the demand for integrative care in the face of increased stress and psychological suffering in the university environment and in public health, promoting well-being through Reiki, health education and strengthening academic belonging. 
";"The results observed indicate growing engagement from the academic community. Between January 2024 and April 2025, 1,470 consultations were held at EERP-USP. The project carried out actions in other populations in the external community, including EERP-USP's freshman reception week (2024) with 80 visits; SMS-RP's 2nd municipal PICS week (2024) with 40 visits; state commemoration of the health worker (SMS-RP/2024) with 40 visits; VIII Symposium and XVII Humanization Meeting (2024) with 15 visits; CAPS III Psychosocial Care (2025) with 30 visits; EERP-USP Postgraduate activity (2025) with 43 visits and EERP-USP freshman reception week (2025) with 45 visits. 
";"Among the main challenges faced by the project are the need to expand dissemination to reach a wider audience of students, teachers and administrative staff at EERP-USP; to ensure the long-term institutional sustainability of the actions; to overcome the still limited recognition of PICS as effective health promotion strategies and to encourage, in the academic context, the ongoing training of Reiki practitioners. Given these challenges, we recommend formalizing institutional policies that integrate Integrative and Complementary Health Practices (ICPHPs) in a structured way into health care in the university context, with a focus on promoting the physical, emotional and mental well-being of the academic community. The effective incorporation of these practices contributes not only to strengthening the integral health of students, teachers and staff, but also to deepening institutional ties with the external community, through care and welcoming actions aimed at the population. In addition, it is important to encourage the production of scientific evidence that validates the benefits of PICS, as a strategy to consolidate its legitimacy and ensure its definitive inclusion in academic spaces and public health services.

Brazil has been experiencing the aging phenomenon in recent decades, and according to the latest 2022(1) Census, the population over 60 reached 15.6%. An increase of 56% compared to the last Census in 2010, when this corresponded to 10.8% of the Brazilian population. We owe this increase in life expectancy to advances and access to technologies in the health area, improvements in the population's living conditions, changes in lifestyle, access to information on health promotion and prevention and control of vaccine-preventable diseases. However, the elderly population, consequently, ends up living with chronic non-communicable diseases for a longer period and pain is one of them, often resulting from pathologies of the musculoskeletal system, circulatory system, trauma, among others.
Pain, according to the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP)(2), is ""an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage"" and is considered a major public health problem.
The Unified Health System (SUS), through its Integrative and Complementary Health Practices (PICS)(3), offers 29 therapeutic resources to complement conventional treatment, either alone or as part of complex medical systems or medical rationales. Utilizing one of these therapeutic resources, Brazil offers a rich biodiversity, including the Amazon, Caatinga, Cerrado, Atlantic Forest, Pantanal and Pampa. And we find in the Cerrado biome a great diversity of species, from which essential oils are extracted, with indication and benefits for relieving pain and inflammation, such as: Copaíba (Copaifera officinalis)(4), Erva Baleeira (Cordia verbenacea)(5), Pimenta de Macaco (Xylopia aromatica)(6) and Sucupira (Pterodon emarginatus Vogel)(7).
Working as an aromatherapy nurse in Primary Health Care, during my home visits to this population over 60, after a nursing consultation, systematization of nursing care and pain assessment, I conduct an aromatherapy session with a selection of these oils diluted in vegetable oil, applied topically to the pain site for a specified period of time.
In my clinical practice, I have found that the use of aromatherapy with essential oils from Brazilian flora in elderly individuals with chronic pain undergoing home care in the city of São Paulo/SP, demonstrates pain relief, improved quality of life, improved health, improved mobility, reduced social isolation, and strengthened interpersonal relationships. This enables the use of this complementary therapy as a powerful and effective tool in combating chronic pain.

In particular, in the context of primary care, practices such as the use of medicinal plants, traditional care, and integration with the environment are fundamental elements for a broader approach to health. In this scenario, community gardens emerge as powerful spaces for promoting health, environmental education, food security, building bonds, and social integration, with great potential for action in the territory of basic health units. 
The university extension project “Sharing knowledge about medicinal plants among Unified Health System users and undergraduate health students” will be developed in the community garden of the Salles Netto Municipal Health Center, linked to a family clinic, located in an urban area of the municipality of Rio de Janeiro. The territory in which the Municipal Health Center is located is characterized by social diversity, a strong presence of traditional knowledge, and challenges related to health promotion and the prevention of chronic diseases. The community garden already exists in the area and involves the participation of users and professionals interested in the articulation between health, the environment, and popular culture.
The initiative brings together nursing, medicine, and pharmacy students from the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, in coordination with professionals from the Salles Netto Municipal Health Center health team and users in the territory. The proposal aims to promote the exchange of knowledge, care experiences, and educational practices centered on the use of medicinal plants, with a focus on strengthening primary care and comprehensive care. This action is part of the principles of critical and transformative university extension, connecting teaching, service, and community in a collaborative proposal for action in the Unified Health System.
The activities developed in the project include conversation circles on health and traditional practices, practical workshops on the preparation of teas, ointments, natural seasonings, and composting, in addition to continuous encouragement for the cultivation, management, and harvesting of medicinal plants in the community garden. These actions are planned jointly by students, professionals, and community members, valuing popular protagonism and active listening as central elements in the collective construction of knowledge.
The main target audience is made up of users of the family clinic and residents of the territory, with special attention to groups that already participate in actions in the garden, such as the elderly, community health agents, and local leaders. The students involved will have the opportunity to experience daily life in the area, develop communication and health education skills, learn about the traditional use of medicinal plants, and reflect on the role of the university in transforming local realities.
The educational and cultivation incentive actions therefore promote effective coordination between teaching, service, and the community. The project encourages the use of natural, accessible, and culturally significant resources as a form of care and prevention, in addition to contributing to food sovereignty and environmental care. By integrating academic knowledge with popular practices, the project also aims to contribute to a more critical professional training, sensitive to social needs and committed to the principles of the Unified Health System.
By promoting the conscious use of medicinal plants and collective cultivation in the garden space, the project consolidates this practice as an accessible and effective strategy for health care, strengthening territoriality, and promoting citizenship. The community garden thus becomes a symbolic and concrete space where the knowledge of the territory and collective health practices meet, fostering autonomy, belonging, bonds, and social participation.";The proposal addresses the devaluation of popular knowledge about medicinal plants in the Unified Health System, the low level of integration between the university and the territory, and the scarcity of collective health practices involving users and professionals from basic health units. It also seeks to overcome the fragmentation of educational actions in primary care and the lack of community spaces for care and well-being, promoting the use of vegetable gardens as a strategy for collective health, healthy eating, social integration, and appreciation of territoriality.;Although still in its early stages, active community participation, strengthening of the bond between users and professionals, and the revival of the daily use of medicinal plants as part of health care are expected. For students, the development of communication skills, educational practices, and greater social awareness is anticipated. The community garden is understood not only as a space for cultivation, but also as a territory for promoting health, environmental education, intergenerational exchanges, and collective knowledge building.;Among the challenges anticipated are the limited cultivation area, the need for inputs and tools, the continuity of actions, and the engagement of health professionals and users. It is recommended that the implementation of similar practices take into account the local context, encourage active listening to the community, and strengthen institutional partnerships. Experience indicates that community gardens linked to primary care can be powerful spaces for care, training, and social transformation, as long as they are sustained by emotional bonds, shared knowledge, and collective participation.;"Complementary Therapies; Community Participation; Unified Health System; health promotion; Medicinal plants"

The ETBE is composed of a multidisciplinary team of permanent staff members, with diverse training in areas such as Acupuncture (Traditional Chinese Medicine), Auriculotherapy, Phytotherapy, Reiki, Family Constellations, Chromotherapy, among others. The service operates by prior appointment and walk-in demand, from 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. Sessions for therapies like Acupuncture and Auriculotherapy are offered in up to 10 sessions, while other therapies are provided in single sessions, depending on the recommendation.;In 2024, a total of 10,996 procedures were performed. The main complaints that led individuals to seek care were general pain (60%), tension (44.7%), insomnia (36.5%), depression (20%), and other issues (43.5%), such as anxiety and fatigue. The most commonly received therapeutic practices were auriculotherapy (90.7%), acupuncture (76.7%), cupping therapy (47.7%), moxibustion (38.4%), Reiki (36%), bioresonance therapy (39.5%), flower essence therapy (23.3%), aromatherapy (16.4%), electroacupuncture (12.8%), family constellation therapy (8.1%), reflexology (3.5%), and ozonotherapy (3.5%).;"The satisfaction survey conducted between November and December 2024, via an electronic form, revealed a high approval rate: 92.8% of users rated the service as very good and 7.2% as good, with no average or poor ratings. Regarding the resolution of complaints, 37.2% reported complete resolution, 36.1% reported relief, and 26.5% reported partial improvement. No patient indicated a lack of benefit.
The majority of services were provided to staff assigned to the municipal departments of Health, Education, Finance, Culture, Communication, Women’s Affairs, and Social Development.
Critical issues identified included the long waiting list for Acupuncture and Naturopathy, limited infrastructure (treatment rooms with partitions that compromise privacy), and the concentration of services among staff located at the Municipal Administrative Center (Paço Municipal) and administrative hubs.
As part of the action plan, proposed measures included infrastructure improvements to ensure greater comfort and privacy, implementation of a scheduling management system to reduce waiting times, expansion of educational activities focused on managing stress and chronic pain, annual surveys to monitor service quality, continuous team training, and outreach strategies to increase access to the ETBE for employees outside the main administrative centers.
User feedback emphasized the humanized care and both physical and emotional benefits of the integrative practices, such as pain relief, improved sleep, reduced anxiety, and an overall increase in well-being.
The ETBE has been consolidating itself as an innovative initiative in integrating Traditional and Integrative Medicine into the public sector, promoting health and quality of life in the workplace.";This experience reinforces the potential of Integrative and Complementary Practices as permanent health policies, contributing to the reduction of absenteeism, improved productivity, and the creation of a healthier work environment.;"Complementary Therapies; traditional medicine; primary care; Occupational Health"

It has been widely implemented across Brazil through the SUS Integrative Practices Program [21,22,23]. This microsystem-based therapy has also been integrated within a spiritual context, in a large Universalist religious institution located in Rio de Janeiro. Combining healthcare with a biopsychosocial-spiritual approach, this model emphasizes a holistic view of the individual’s experience of illness and health, encompassing physical, social, emotional, and spiritual dimensions [3,24]. Auriculotherapy integrates multiple medical rationalities — understood as organized systems of knowledge and practices that guide different perspectives on health and disease. Among these are Reflexology, Neurophysiological Biomedicine, and Traditional Chinese Medicine [13]. In this spiritual context, Vibrational Medicine was integrated, recognizing the body's energy centers—commonly known as chakras—as vital elements of the subtle energy system, culturally understood to be associated with multiple dimensions of physical, emotional, and spiritual well-being [6,8,28]. This report aims to describe the experience of implementing evidence-based auriculotherapy in a spiritual context.
The practice is free of charge and carried out by trained volunteers of the institution, under the supervision of a healthcare professional certified in Evidence-Based Auriculotherapy by UFSC/Ministry of Health (in Brazil) - all volunteers sign a confidentiality and non-disclosure agreement. Weekly sessions are held, typically ranging from 5 to 8 encounters, with duration of approximately 10 minutes, during which no more than 10 auricular points are stimulated. The methodology includes: (1) welcoming with a compassionate presence, followed by anamnesis and a comprehensive structured interview – on the first day; (2) application of mustard seeds on selected auricular points according to the main complaint — with therapists assigned randomly for each session [21,22]; (3) Laying on of hands over the auricular region and areas corresponding to major chakras — a widely accepted practice across spiritual traditions, previously investigated in the context of pain management [4,18,28].
During the anamnesis, the following data are collected: sociodemographic characteristics, clinical history, medication use, complementary and spiritual practices, and the intensity and frequency of physical and emotional pain (before, during, and after treatment), using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)[9,21,25,27,28,29]. 
All individuals who seek this practice at the institution receive care from a team of trained volunteers and all information is stored in the Institution’s Historical Records, with informed consent from each participant, in accordance with Law No. 13.709/2018 (General Law for the Protection of Personal Data – LGPD)[2].";This institutional initiative promotes care for individuals experiencing suffering and social vulnerability within a spiritual context that embraces diverse beliefs without engaging in religious proselytism. The approach expands care through a biopsychosocial-spiritual model, enhances scientific inquiry in naturalistic and community-based contexts, and values complementary health practices as part of a broader model of care — one that requires rigorous investigation without relinquishing epistemological courage.;;"A key challenge lies in consolidating the scientific legitimacy of integrative practices applied in spiritual and religious settings. Additional challenges include the continued systematization of collected data, the strengthening of volunteer therapist training, the refinement of the care protocol, and the promotion of scientific dissemination of this experience through naturalistic research within and outside spiritual contexts, including comparisons between both contexts as conducted previously in studies involving other practices [28].
It is recommended to encourage researchers to investigate the effects of these practices in such settings, recognizing the importance of overcoming the reluctance to study spiritual contexts - acknowledging that science is ultimately shaped by what scientists choose to explore [14].";"Auriculotherapy; Holistic Health; Spiritual Therapies"

The League’s meetings are extracurricular and aim to explore and deepen topics not addressed in the formal curriculum. At the students’ request, a lecture was held on the topic “Applications of Homeopathy in Pediatric Practice,” presented by Professor Brunna Vila, a pediatrician and specialist in integrative pediatrics. The in-person session lasted 1 hour and 30 minutes and was attended by 28 students. During the lecture, the historical foundations of homeopathy were discussed, along with its therapeutic principles, like the law of similars, minimal doses, and experimentation in healthy individuals – in addition to its clinical applications in pediatrics. The session also covered Brazilian legislation related to integrative practices and the most common indications for homeopathy in pediatric care. Moreover, a clinical case was presented and space was provided for critical discussion, allowing reflection on the limitations, benefits and challenges of incorporating homeopathy into medical practice.;This experience aimed to address several challenges currently faced in medical education. The inclusion of integrative and complementary practices remains largely absent from formal medical school curricula, which limits the therapeutic repertoire available to students. Additionally, there is a noticeable lack of institutional space for non-conventional subjects such as homeopathy, often excluded from academic programs due to the absence of qualified faculty, limited time within the curriculum, or a lack of pedagogical openness. The Pediatric Academic League proved to be an ideal setting for the discussion of such topics, reflecting a genuine concern and commitment to integrative and complementary practices. It offered students the opportunity to explore real-world approaches, including clinical case discussions and examples of prescriptions that led to positive outcomes. In doing so, the lecture helped to demystify homeopathy, clarify its theoretical and practical foundations, and promote critical thinking. It also broadened students’ understanding of complementary approaches to conventional biomedical treatments.;;The lecture had a positive impact on the members of the Pediatric Academic League, as reflected in the students’ interest, engagement, and active participation during and after the session. A significant level of unfamiliarity with homeopathy as a practice recognized by the Brazilian Federal Council of Medicine and incorporated into the Unified Health System (SUS) through the National Policy on Integrative and Complementary Practices (PNPIC) was observed. Students expressed spontaneous curiosity and a desire to further explore the topic. They suggested future meetings with opportunities to discuss a greater number of clinical cases and explore potential hands-on experiences. It is recommended that other Academic Leagues – as student-led extracurricular spaces – also consider including content on integrative practices such as homeopathy, as this contributes to expanding the therapeutic repertoire of future physicians. Given that homeopathy is a medical practice officially recognized by the Brazilian Federal Council of Medicine and supported by public health policies through the PNPIC, it is also recommended that it be formally included in the medical school curriculum.;"Homeopathy; integrative pediatrics; Medical education"

The initiative was conceived by pediatrician Nilene Gouvêa, the physician responsible for the implementation of Pediatric Integrative Oncology at INCA in October 2022. It is based on the Brazilian National Policy on Integrative and Complementary Practices (PNPIC/SUS), aligned with World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations, and enhanced through Anthroposophic Medicine.
The multidisciplinary team includes the physician, two nurses, a physiotherapist, a nutritionist, an occupational therapist, and an art therapist, all invited to join the project. The objective of this pilot initiative was to promote sensory integration with nature within the hospital setting, aimed at visually impaired children with cancer (in this report: retinoblastoma and rhabdomyosarcoma) receiving outpatient care, by strengthening affective bonds and therapeutic involvement.";The sensory journey was inspired by Goethean phenomenology and structured around the concept of the twelve human senses described by Rudolf Steiner, in which each sense represents a portal to experience and connect with the world. The session began with a team introduction and an invitation to a renewed sensory experience (sensory reactivation). This was followed by exploration of natural foods prepared by the nutrition team, stimulating smell, taste, and touch. Subsequently, the children and their caregivers walked through a “forest path” built with natural elements (pebbles, vegetables, leaves, wind, bird songs, and running water), activating the senses of movement, balance, hearing, and vitality.;"The experience fostered deep immersion in each child’s inner world. Observed outcomes included enhanced emotional resilience, connection to the environment, and increased motivation for continuing treatment. Caregivers also reported significant improvements in the children's well-being. Each child created a symbolic sensory garden, allowing for the elaboration of inner experiences through sensory engagement.

The active participation of the interdisciplinary team was key: occupational therapy promoted autonomy and engagement; physiotherapy contributed with postural balance and body awareness; nutrition offered personalized and emotionally resonant nourishment; anthroposophic art therapy enabled deep emotional expression through clay modeling, fostering embodied presence, imagination, and sensory-affective integration. Nursing ensured emotional safety, active listening, and continuous support.Beyond its therapeutic value, this session inspired the development of a permanent initiative to incorporate nature into the hospital environment as part of the Pediatric Integrative Oncology service at INCA. This innovative program was highlighted in Revista Rede Câncer, issue no. 52 (October 2023), emphasizing the benefits of integrating conventional and complementary care within the Brazilian Unified Health System (SUS), with documented improvements in quality of life, symptom relief, and reduced hospital readmissions.";"
In conclusion, this pilot program innovatively integrates clinical, sensory, and emotional dimensions, reaffirming the therapeutic, pedagogical, and humanistic value of Integrative Medicine in pediatric oncology care. The initiative demonstrates feasibility, replicability, and significant potential for broader implementation across public health institutions in Latin America.";"Integrative Medicine; Pediatric Oncology; Visual Impairment; Anthroposophic Medicine; Public Hospitals; "

“My Gosh, this practice is so relaxing. By the end of it, it felt like my body was floating. Such enormous peace – I do want to do this continually!” 

Lessons Learned
Even when done sporadically, the practices offered techniques that professionals can carry into their personal routines, promoting self-care autonomy and greater awareness of their mental and emotional health.
The objectives were fully achieved: there was voluntary participation, positive feedback, an immediate sense of well-being, and a desire to continue the practices. ";"Recommendations 
	•	Including integrative practices in the institutional calendar. 
	•	Assigning a dedicated professional to carry out PICs, ensuring continuity and expansion of the actions. 
	•	Providing simple materials such as essential oils and therapeutic playlists. 
Future Directions: 
	•	Expand the frequency of the practices; 
	•	Implement evaluation protocols with daily or weekly well-being feedback to identify needs; 
	•	Integrate PICs into the regular initiatives for professional appreciation. 
Contribution to the Field
The experience at AME Assis demonstrates that Integrative and Complementary Practices (PICs) are powerful, feasible, and low-cost tools for promoting the mental health of SUS professionals. Caring for the caregiver directly impacts the quality of care provided to patients. ";"yoga; aromatherapy; Music Therapy; mental health"

In this context, the Municipal Health Department, responding to the need for innovative strategies to address non-communicable chronic diseases, mental health conditions, and psychosocial distress—often exacerbated by urban, disconnected lifestyles—has been promoting care actions that integrate SUS principles with complementary and integrative practices.
In June 2025, a two-day training course was held to award an International Certification in Nature Connection Facilitation. Fifteen health professionals from the municipal network participated, including physicians, nurses, dentists, nutritionists, psychologists, and community health agents.
The entire training took place at Anthero dos Santos Park, using its trails and green areas as the setting for the activities. The course was led by a trainer from the Sírio-Libanês Institute of Education and Research and certified by the Forest Therapy Hub, an international organization dedicated to nature-based therapies.
The methodology included theoretical foundations of ecopsychology, forest medicine, and biophilia. The program offered theoretical discussions, sensory experiences, and group reflections, followed by a participatory evaluation. The training addressed both collective care and self-care, highlighting nature as a promoter of holistic health and fostering ecological health education.";"During the training, it was necessary to adapt the physical space, as the site was originally designed only for collective leisure, outdoor activities, and contact with nature. The lack of a suitable indoor environment required the use of a former playroom, which was adapted by the Municipal Health Department team to serve as a classroom. The urban environment surrounding the park generated noise that occasionally interfered with the sensory practices. Nevertheless, with support from the facilitator and participants’ cooperation, activities proceeded without significant disruption.
There was also initial resistance from some professionals who perceived the approach as subjective or distant from conventional clinical practice. However, this perception changed over time through engagement with theoretical content and lived experiences. An open dialogue environment and active listening were key to strengthening group involvement.";;"This experience expanded participants’ professional repertoires, encouraged the integration of human and environmental care, and strengthened health practices grounded in local context. Participants reported positive personal and professional impacts.
It is recommended that topics related to ecological health and integrative practices be incorporated into continuing education for health professionals. The methodology proved feasible, low-cost, and highly replicable.
To scale up such initiatives, the involvement of local health management, partnerships with recognized training institutions, and the use of accessible natural areas are essential. Valuing interdisciplinary knowledge and aligning with the National Policy on Integrative and Complementary Practices (PNPIC/SUS) are crucial for success.
The systematization of this experience reinforces the relevance of nature-based therapies within public health, fostering more humanized, sustainable care practices aligned with the principles of planetary health.";"Complementary Therapies; health promotion; Environment; Public Health; Health Education"

It is a course at the intersection of biology and art, where participants are brought into contact with nature through the observation of plant and animal specimens (living, herbarium-mounted, or taxidermied), followed by free expression of these observations using expressive graphic materials and creative writing. The course is conducted as an art therapy process, under the guidance and supervision of an art therapist and biologist.
Each class includes the following stages: 1- A visit to an exhibition area of the Museum of Biological Diversity (MDBio) (https://www.ib.unicamp.br/museu_zoologia/, https://www.instagram.com/mdbiounicamp?igsh=ZWxnbDViZ3NtMXBr), guided by biologists specialized in the subject, providing striking visual and tactile stimulation through natural elements from various species; 2- Geometric drawings based on 3, 4, and 12-sided figures (progressively developed from base-3 geometry in the first session to base-12 in the fifth), positioned within circles to form mandalas; 3- Expressive activity to externalize thoughts and feelings using art materials (drawing and painting), through shapes and colors, with no requirement for prior artistic experience or adherence to aesthetic standards; 4- Creative writing prompted by reflective questions and statements about self-awareness and workplace/social relationships; 5- Sharing session, where participants who wish may present their work and share perceptions, thoughts, emotions, and feelings.
Activities 2 through 4 are conducted with a curated soundscape—musical playlists designed to facilitate the intended outcomes of the process. These include:moments of reflection on the world of work through nature-inspired activities; emotional release via visual expression guided by art therapy;  relaxation to ease persistent mild anxiety; activation to counteract lethargy in cases of mild yet persistent depression; stimulation of creativity in dealing with workplace relationships, tasks, and challenges. 
In the final session, participants create a biographical art book compiling their individual works, allowing them to reflect on the experience and its impact on their inner world. The main goal is to provide reflective moments on the working world through nature-inspired activities that allow for the release of thoughts and emotions.
The course duration is 18 hours, delivered in six weekly sessions of three hours each. Materials required include art supplies such as specific drawing and painting papers, colored pencils, soft pastel, watercolor paints, brushes, compasses, rulers, graphite pencils, and erasers.

";"We were concerned with three issues: 1- The 18-hour duration with six 3-hour weekly sessions might discourage supervisors from releasing their employees; 2- Low enrollment due to the graphic expression activities, with potential participants self-excluding because they believe they can't draw; 3- Mixing employees from different hierarchical levels could inhibit more subjective expressions.
";" There was no conflict or mismatch between the art therapy process—bridging the objectivity of biological sciences and the subjectivity of mental processes tied to workplace environments and dynamics. On the contrary, the more detailed and accurate the biological information about the observed specimens (their interactions, behaviors, habitats, etc.), the deeper the subjective engagement and the more creative the results in both visual and written expression.
The diversity in educational and occupational levels within the participant group (including technical administrative or lab staff, undergraduates, postgraduates, researchers, and professors) did not interfere with the depth of emotional engagement. The course successfully achieved its reflective goals, which were visibly expressed through participants’ verbal and graphical output.
";"Mental health and well-being care within corporate environments, as proposed here, aligns with the concept of cultural prescriptions in museum settings and gains balancing power through the synergy of nature, art, and science.
 The number of participants should not exceed 20 in order to create a safe and connected environment conducive to free expression.
 Weekly sessions are ideal for balancing psychological processing time with minimal disruption to work duties. We are currently offering the course to the second group and our plan is to offer it to 8 more.

For the school´s members, the meaning of life is to find one´s gift, and the purpose of life is to offer it. At the health centers, the practice of blessing takes place at UBS 1 (Lago Norte), UBS 6 (Taguatinga) and UBS 9 in São Sebastião.  In the UCs, the school has been working with the Cerrado Recconection Program, at the spaces of the Ecological Parks: Riacho Fundo, Asa Sul and Sucupira (Planaltina), cooperating in order to value environmental sustainability in the relationship between biodiversity and spirituality, strengthening ecosystem services, in the category of cultural services, which cover health, spirituality and social well-being.;"Thus, thousands of people benefit from listening, guidance and prayer through blessing in face-to-face and virtual services. 
Resources such as herbal medicine, aromatherapy, laying on hands and music therapy are also used to enhance blessings according to Traditional, Complementary and Integrative Medicine (TCIM). In this connection between health, spirituality and the environment, SHSB strengthens the expanded concept of Health, bringing together prayers and knowledge in appropriate places to promote well-being and help people's health. 
On previously announced days and times and in partnership with the Health Department and the Brasília Environmental Institute, each year the services expand and gain space in the various reports and invitations to take part in events, as well as the accounts of those who live the experience and the benefits of the blessing.";"From 2016 to 2019, services were primarily provided at health centers, with around 8,100 visits. Between 2020 and 2021, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the services were provided virtually twice a week, on average with more than 400 services per week, and currently the list of names for the virtual blessing reaches more than 1,000 services. From 2022 to the present day, blessings have been provided both in person and virtually, with more than 18,000 visits a year. 
The School of Healers through its blessing practices, has participated in approximately 9 news reports and around 12 events, such as RAÍZES (Meeting of Herbalist, Traditional healer, Midwives and Shamans), the Care Space at the XV and XVII National Health Conference, the March of the Daisies, among others.";"The challenges currently faced are the large number of people who receive care and the small number of healers. Despite annual training, not all of them continue to volunteer, and the practice of traditional healer is not qualified under the PNPIC.
However, the healers who remain are strengthened in their practice of service by reports such as: “My mother used to take me to a traditional heale when I was little and I never found one again, and now you're here, thank God” and “Today I left here better than when I arrived, my headache is gone”. Thus, also with the support of established partnerships, healing continues to be an ancestral art of saying good things that promotes health and well-being, integrates practices with the community and contributes to valuing knowledge and recognizing environmental biodiversity, an important link between all beings in nature and in institutions.";"volunteer; blessing; well-being; unique health; herbalist"

The narrative emphasizes the discrepancy between the institutional discourse promoting research and the practical barriers to enabling innovative initiatives, such as meditation and the Feldenkrais Method®, for both patients and healthcare professionals.
The National Policy on Integrative and Complementary Practices (PNPIC) proposes a model of comprehensive care that may represent an innovation within Brazil’s Unified Health System (SUS), especially in light of the rise in chronic conditions and population aging. This account describes an experience between 2013 and 2014 at the National Institute of Traumatology and Orthopedics (INTO/MS), a federal hospital that has an ethics committee, scientific commission, and internal research support infrastructure.

The project, approved by institutional bodies, was implemented in the rehabilitation department with the goal of offering integrative practices to patients with chronic pain. Although officially approved, the work faced numerous logistical barriers and institutional resistance, such as competition for physical spaces, lack of support in organizing sessions, failures in supplying the snacks agreed upon with the clinical research department (Peclin), and a lack of institutional recognition for the time spent on the intervention.

Additionally, the author launched the ""MEDITA-INTO"" project, which offered regular meditation sessions and Feldenkrais® Method classes to the institution’s professionals. The initial uptake was positive, but the activity was discontinued due to the lack of space and logistical support. Despite the institution’s pro-innovation rhetoric, the practice revealed structural, cultural, and management barriers.

";"
Despite the barriers, the research was successfully conducted and resulted in benefits perceived by the participants. The sessions contributed to pain relief, improved well-being, and active engagement in self-care. Additionally, the experience raised awareness among some internal sectors and demonstrated that it is possible to implement integrative practices even in environments resistant to change.";"
Participants reported positive effects from the sessions, including improved pain perception, better sleep, increased body awareness, and a sense of being cared for. The project also encouraged internal reflections on the need for greater integration between care, education, and research.";"It is recommended that policies for the effective institutional support of research on integrative practices within the SUS be established, with recognition of the professionals involved, the provision of minimum infrastructure, and a commitment to established agreements.

The main challenge is to transform the discourse of innovation promotion into concrete practices, ensuring resources, adequate spaces, and protected time for such activities. Institutional resistance must be acknowledged as a real limiting factor and addressed through awareness strategies, intersectoral dialogue, and cultural change.";"NPICP; NPICP Challenges; SUS"

This was the first PICS discipline developed at UFRJ. It aimed to present the National Policy for Integrative and Complementary Practices (PNPIC), created in Brazil in 2006 (Brasil, 2006), and to broaden knowledge of different integrative practices through theoretical and practical interdisciplinary experiences. The discipline is optional and consists of 30 hours of instruction. It has been offered eight times to date, with the participation of over 200 students. Teachers are members of different undergraduate health courses at UFRJ-Macaé and are complemented by guest professionals from the Municipal Health Network of Macaé, Brazil, who have training in integrative practices. In 2024, a similar discipline began in Rio de Janeiro, created by the Music Therapy course in conjunction with the Nursing, Occupational Therapy, and Pharmacy courses at UFRJ. It was offered only once and had 10 students. Lectures are taught by professors from the various courses as well as by technicians who work with different integrative practices offered by the university or by professionals from the Unified Health System (SUS). The offered discipline proved important for the students' training as it promoted comprehensive knowledge of PICS through sensitive experiences that produced subjectivity. These experiences made the students realize the importance of a holistic approach as well as interdisciplinarity and interprofessionality to expand integral care in the SUS (Arruda et al., 2025). In Macaé, lectures have already been held on Music Therapy, Floral Therapy, Reiki, Medicinal Plants And Herbal Medicines, Meditation, Yoga, Integrative Community Therapy, Circular Dance, Traditional Chinese Medicine, Ayurveda, Shantala, and Homeopathy. In Rio de Janeiro, the following practices were covered: Floral Therapy, Music Therapy, Traditional Chinese Medicine, Homeopathy, Reiki, Meditation, Yoga, Integrative Community Therapy, And Medicinal Plants and Phytotherapy. Students present other approaches that are part of the 29 integrative practices included in the PNPIC at the end of the program in seminars so that they have access to information on as many practices as possible.";It is necessary to expand knowledge of integrative and complementary practices in undergraduate health courses because they are still incipient, generating relative ignorance among most professionals (Tesser, Souza, & Nascimento, 2018). The PNPIC values soft technologies, such as welcoming and listening, which are fundamental to promoting care in primary health care, and go against the medicalization of life (Pereira, Souza, & Schweitzer, 2022). Teaching about integrative practices at the university level is still predominantly optional and informative. Health courses should take an integrated approach aimed at interaction and complementarity between different types of knowledge (Nascimento et al., 2018).;"At the end of the semester, students evaluate the course using a written form and during a collective discussion. The Macaé students' evaluations indicate that the course contributed to the following: a greater understanding of PICS and its importance in promoting integrality in the Unified Health System (SUS); stimulation of the use of PICS for self-care; interest in seeking training in one of the presented practices; perception of the importance of interdisciplinarity and interprofessionality in academic training and future professional practice due to integration with teachers and students from different courses; perception of the importance of scientific proof of PICS; perception of the relaxation and well-being promoted by the practice experiences during classes. Moreover, students from UFRJ courses in Rio said the subject helped them reduce prejudice about some of the presented practices and sparked interest in researching PICS. It also promoted interest in training in integrative practices, provided an interdisciplinary and interprofessional experience, and presented theory followed by practical activities that promoted knowledge of how PICS contributes to balanced care of the body, mind, and emotions, promoting self-knowledge and stimulating self-care to avoid stress and improve quality of life.";Teaching about PICS should be made compulsory so that all health students have access to this knowledge and can direct patients to qualified professionals, contributing to comprehensive care in the SUS. It is also important that the teaching process promote integration between teachers and students from different courses to stimulate interdisciplinarity and interprofessionality.

In accordance with Brazil's guidelines for Traditional and Complementary Integrative Medicines (TCIM), the importance of incorporating this technique into academic curricula is highlighted as a strategy for fostering humanized, interdisciplinary, and evidence-based training.
Ozone therapy is a therapeutic approach that employs ozone (O?), produced from medical-grade oxygen (O?), and has shown effectiveness in wound healing, dermatological sanitation, and infection control. As noted by Bocci (2011), the technique is both efficient and economically feasible, thereby expanding access to safe therapeutic alternatives—especially in resource-constrained settings.
In Brazil, ozone therapy is regulated by Resolution No. 572/2013 of the Federal Council of Pharmacy (CFF), authorizing qualified pharmacists to apply advanced therapeutic technologies, including ozone therapy, within an ethical and clinically responsible framework. The integration of this subject into academic training contributes to the development of technical and humanistic competencies, preparing professionals for innovative, interdisciplinary roles that align with contemporary public health demands.
In this context, the teaching of ozone therapy enhances the pharmacist’s role as an active care provider, encouraging critical, evidence-based practice focused on improving patients’ quality of life. Academic environments that facilitate engagement with integrative practices support the construction of more diverse, effective, and patient-centered healthcare models.";"Despite growing recognition of complementary integrative practices (CIPs), the teaching of ozone therapy faces significant challenges within pharmacy curricula. One major barrier is the lack of awareness among students and faculty, who often lack familiarity with its scientific foundations and clinical applications. This gap contributes to low engagement and perpetuates misconceptions and unjustified resistance.
Ozone therapy is frequently mischaracterized as an unvalidated or unsupported practice, even though it is referenced in scientific literature and endorsed by professional regulations. Such prejudice, even among healthcare professionals, underscores the need for educational initiatives that promote accurate information and foster interdisciplinary dialogue to break through long-standing misinformation.
To address this scenario, four university extension events—two in-person and two virtual—were organized to disseminate information on ozone therapy and encourage student engagement. The response was remarkable: the first edition alone attracted over 100 participants. Attendees included students from Pharmacy and Biology programs at the School of Biological and Health Sciences of the Universidade do Estado do Rio de Janeiro (UERJ), as well as faculty members and technical staff, highlighting the educational relevance of the technique.
These initiatives reveal genuine demand for qualified information about integrative practices. Events like these not only disseminate technical knowledge but also stimulate critical thinking and elevate scientifically supported alternative therapies.
An additional factor is the social impact of ozone therapy. Due to its low cost, safety, and ease of application, it offers a tangible opportunity to broaden healthcare access—particularly in underserved communities. Equipping pharmacists with the skills to apply this technique helps democratize therapeutic resources and reinforce a more humanized, inclusive care approach.
Overcoming these challenges requires more than curricular reform—it demands a shift in institutional mindset, grounded in scientific recognition, innovation, and alignment with societal health needs.";"The reported experience revealed significant interest and engagement among participants in the extension activities on ozonetherapy. Four sessions were held—two in-person and two virtual—with approximately 320 attendees, including Pharmacy and Biology students from the State University of Rio de Janeiro (UERJ), as well as faculty and technical professionals. The rapid enrollment, with over 100 registrations in the first edition, underscored an unmet demand for scientific and technical content on integrative practices.

Participant evaluations indicated that 84% experienced a notable improvement in theoretical and clinical understanding of ozonetherapy, while 76% expressed interest in further exploring the topic within their academic or professional journey. These findings highlight the value of interdisciplinary, evidence-based educational approaches in fostering innovative therapeutic practices.

This initiative contributed to expanding educational horizons, reducing stigma, and positioning ozonetherapy as a promising tool in health promotion—particularly in communities with limited access to conventional care.";"To strengthen the role of ozone therapy in pharmaceutical education, structural and cultural barriers must be addressed. Key issues include:
•	Insufficient technical and scientific understanding, resulting in resistance to curricular inclusion
•	Lack of faculty training, limiting in-depth and responsible instruction
•	Shortage of updated didactic materials, affecting teaching quality
•	Low volume of national scientific output, which constrains academic and institutional debate

Recommended strategies include:
•	Integrating ozone therapy as a complementary component within the Complementary and Integrative Practices discipline in pharmacy programs—including potential mandatory inclusion
•	Offering targeted training for faculty and technical staff, supported by experts and reference institutions
•	Promoting academic research—such as case studies and clinical trials—to validate the technique and increase scientific recognition
•	Organizing interdisciplinary events, workshops, and seminars to engage multiple health disciplines and foster informed debate
•	Employing ozone therapy in university extension projects, particularly in low-income communities, as a means of delivering low-cost and effective healthcare solutions

The development of ozone therapy within pharmaceutical education demonstrates that, despite persistent obstacles, the field presents substantial academic and professional opportunities. Its clinical application is scientifically grounded, professionally regulated by the CFF, and carries meaningful social impact. To fully realize its potential, educational programs must combine scientific rigor with ethics, social responsibility, and innovative thinking.
Investing in the teaching of ozone therapy means empowering pharmacists as key players in healthcare promotion, expanding their therapeutic repertoire, and strengthening their contributions within care networks. Transforming prejudice into knowledge and misinformation into qualified practice is essential to firmly establish ozone therapy as a safe, effective, and accessible alternative , with positive implications for professional development and the health of Brazil’s population.

The initiative integrates traditional and academic knowledge for health education, within the scope of Brazil's National Policy on Integrative and Complementary Practices in Health (PNPICS) and the National Policy on Medicinal Plants and Phytotherapeutics (PNPMF), from November 2023 until current days, through  practical activities in the plants cultivation bens and discussion groups with tasting of extemporaneous preparations of the species in the collection, contributing to the field of traditional, complementary, and integrative medicine (TCIM). The garden serves as a space for popular education, through the integration of knowledge and the promotion of One Health (human, animal, and environmental).;The initiative addressed initial challenges related to its institutionalization and long-term sustainability. Difficulties in obtaining certified plant species were overcome through strategic partnerships with academic institutions and public bodies, ensuring greater recognition and support for volunteer activities.;Volunteer actions resulted in an increase in biodiversity in the medicinal plant garden, with the creation of seven new beds, and consequently, a significant expansion of the botanical collection, incorporating more than 20 new certified medicinal species. Throughout the period, the plan to develop interest and promote greater participation was realized through the strengthening of community ties, practical activities among the volunteer team, as WELL as the formation of bonds with partner institutions. During the period, a notable increase in active weekly participation was observei, currently with approximately 30 volunteers, including local residents, students, the elderly, and health professionals, demonstrating the initiative's capacity to engage diverse segments of the population. Thematic workshops on the rational use of medicinal plants were carried out and scheduled to occur bimontly throughout the year, addressing the use of anxiolytic, digestivo and anti-inflamatory plants, for e amole, with the donation of approximately 50 seedlings, promoting health education and access to natural resources for person-centered care, in the context of One Health. The initiative also managed to consolidate a university extension project and integrate it into the local government's initial environmental preservation project, ensuring greater institutionalization and sustainability for the project.;The formalization of intersectoral partnerships and alignment with national public policies, such as PNPMF and PNPICS, supported by the global traditional medicine strategy 2025–2034, is recommended to ensure the longevity of similar initiatives.;"Volunteers; TCIM; Medicinal plants; Popular Education"

It contextualizes their development within the municipal policy of Integrative and Complementary Practices (PICS), where therapeutic gardens were implemented to promote well-being, autonomy, and sustainability. The initiative was built on the principles of One Health and comprehensive care, incorporating traditional and scientific knowledge. From the 1990s to the present day, therapeutic gardens have been consolidating themselves as a tool for health promotion, popular education, strengthening primary care, and community integration. The use of this practice, combined with intersectoral public policies, demonstrates the potential to reduce social determinants, promoting autonomy, well-being, and the connection between health, the environment, and local culture. Description The practice of therapeutic gardens was developed in the municipality of Vitória, Espírito Santo, as a strategic health initiative. The city has been a pioneer in implementing PICS since 1990. Located in an urban area with social and cultural diversity, the practice emerged from the appreciation of folk knowledge, traditional medicines, and the need to offer gentler, more natural care methods. Beginning in the 1990s, with the inclusion of phytotherapy as the city's first PIC, the first therapeutic garden projects emerged, linked to health units, schools, and psychosocial care centers. The practice involves the cultivation of medicinal plants, workshops on herbal medicine preparation, garden cultivation and care workshops, and educational activities, in partnership with both the Vitória City Hall and external institutions. Today, therapeutic gardens are present in 16 services, 13 of which are run by the health department and another 3 by partner services. They offer activities such as cultivation workshops, tea preparation, aromatic salts, and other integrative practices. The proposal emerged as a strategy to promote health and strengthen primary care, fostering the rational use of herbal medicines and intersectoral collaboration with the environment, education, and social assistance.;"Issues Addressed Therapeutic gardens were conceived as a response to multiple public health challenges, including: 
     • Offering more natural health-promoting practices that can reduce medicalization; 
     • Lack of access to natural therapies; 
    • Provision of welcoming spaces and therapy with soft technologies in CAPS (Personal Care Centers). 
     • Disconnection between traditional knowledge and clinical practice; 
    • Lack of spaces for community life and collective care in the territories; 
    • Low recognition of health promotion actions in the healthcare model and loss of traditional and popular knowledge.";"Over the years, 23 therapeutic gardens were established in the municipal health network of Vitória, Espírito Santo. Of these, 10 were discontinued for various reasons. Today, the health services have 13 therapeutic gardens, in addition to another 3 in partner services. During the implementation process of each therapeutic garden, guardians were trained to care for the space. An average of 10 people were trained per garden, totaling approximately 200 people.

Another point to consider is the holding of workshops on the topic, involving the participation of service users and staff. These workshops discuss topics such as plant cultivation, plant care, and the conscious use of medicinal plants, according to service needs. The average number of workshops is no less than 50 per year, with an average attendance of 20 people per workshop. However, the same people often participate in multiple workshops, making it difficult to quantify the total.

With the implementation of therapeutic gardens and the activities developed, we can affirm that:
• Improved user acceptance and participation in therapeutic gardens;
• Integration and improvement of practices with health services and partners;
• Increased the number of therapeutic garden guardians, with skills to care for and ensure the quality of the final product;
• Conducted workshops on health, the environment, self-care, and sustainability;
• Expanded the rational and safe use of medicinal plants;
• Coordination between popular education initiatives, food security, self-care, and mental health;
• The acceptance of the gardens by the community and professionals has provided greater autonomy and the provision of new forms of care.

Furthermore, in November the Municipal Forum of Integrative and Complementary Practices is held, where on the last day the Municipal Meeting of Therapeutic Gardens is held, with approximately 30 participants per year who share their experiences with guardians of the therapeutic gardens.";"Although progress has been significant, there are still challenges to be overcome and achievements to be achieved, including: 
• Expansion of PICS training for more professionals in the SUS network and partners; 
• Monitoring and tracking therapeutic gardens, their potential and care; 
• Integrating the practice with other service activities, enhancing care; 
• Strengthening and integrating education, health, and environmental policies; 
• Incorporating therapeutic gardens into more health facilities;";"therapeutic gardens; Integrative and Complementary Practices (PICS); sustainability; health promotion"

Ayurveda, a traditional Indian system of medicine, is considered a lifestyle medicine that aims to maintain optimal health through the adoption of self-care routines. The present study aimed to develop a method for applying Ayurvedic daily practices within the Brazilian Unified Health System (SUS) and to assess the role of these practices in improving the QoL of healthcare professionals from the Family Health Strategy of Paty do Alferes/RJ, Brazil, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants were recruited through active outreach, involving in-person visits to health units. Selected professionals received guidance through theoretical and practical educational activities, referred to as “Living Ayurveda.” The guidance was delivered in modules totaling 20 hours, based on and adapted from the concept of Trayopastambha, with a focus on four key areas: Nutrition, Sleep, Mental Relaxation, and Physical Movement. Quality of life was assessed using the WHOQOL-BREF, a validated QoL questionnaire provided by the World Health Organization, self-administered before and after the intervention. Results were analyzed statistically in the third month. The method developed followed a person-centered approach, placing the individual at the core of their care and supporting them in decision-making. All topics were structured and implemented according to the following format: Anchor (a practice for connecting with intention and bringing focus to the present moment), Discussion (theoretical exploration of the topic using Ayurvedic concepts) and Challenge (suggested practices and/or activities for implementing Ayurvedic concepts in daily life). ;The study was developed in response to the high prevalence of lifestyle-related diseases and their effects on the physical and mental well-being of healthcare professionals, which were further exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic. It also addressed the lack of structured, accessible, and culturally adapted non-pharmacological strategies for health promotion within the Brazilian public health system, as well as the underutilization of traditional systems of knowledge, such as Ayurveda, in this context.;A total of 30 healthcare professionals participated in the study, which took place from July to October 2021, over a three-month period. The material used in the intervention gave rise to a practical guide entitled “AYURVEDA: Observe, Experience & Transform – A Practical Guide for Maintaining Good Health”, designed to facilitate the introduction of Ayurvedic daily practices into the healthcare system while considering regional specificities. The content was intended for both healthcare professionals and the general public, with the goal of promoting holistic health. Data from the WHOQOL-BREF questionnaire showed improvements in perceived QoL in the physical, psychological, and environmental domains (p > 0.05), while the social domain did not show statistically significant results. The physical domain, which includes aspects such as energy/fatigue, sleep/rest, and mobility—elements directly addressed by the intervention—showed the greatest increase in average total QoL score: from 61.07 (±18.26) before to 72.02 (±13.39) after the intervention.;The findings highlight the potential of Ayurvedic daily practices to promote health and improve quality of life in a feasible, non-pharmacological, and low-cost manner. However, expanding the application of this approach within public health systems presents some important challenges. These include sustaining long-term engagement with the practices, incorporating them effectively into the routines of health services. Further research with broader populations and extended follow-up periods is essential to strengthen the evidence base and guide the development of public policies that support the integration of traditional knowledge into contemporary health strategies.;"ayurveda; Quality of Life; Holistic Health"

An elective ICP course was incorporated into the medical curriculum, offering students the opportunity to explore and experience innovative therapeutic methods.
Foot reflexology is an integrative and complementary practice that uses compressive foot massage to stimulate reflex points in the feet, promoting therapeutic benefits through the stimulation of nerve endings. This technique aids in pain control, stress and anxiety reduction, and alleviates physical and emotional exhaustion.
The reported experience refers to the application of foot reflexology by 6th-semester medical students at Estácio de Sá University, Città Campus, during the Integrative Practices course held in June 2025. The goal of the activity was to promote relaxation, well-being, and reduce stress, anxiety, and pain among participants.
The methodology consisted of a practical session conducted in the skills lab, with 32 students participating. The instructor began the activity with an explanation of key reflex points on the feet related to organs and patient complaints. The session began with foot mapping, followed by pressure application on reflex points, nerve stimulation, and observation of body responses. Students worked in pairs, performed a brief anamnesis with their colleagues, and then guided the person to a stretcher to begin the session. Pain levels were recorded before and after the technique was applied, with each session lasting an average of 30 minutes per participant. Materials used included cotton, 70% alcohol for foot hygiene, moisturizing cream, reflexology foot charts, and disposable paper sheets to cover the stretchers. The experience proved enriching and effective as a complementary practice for promoting holistic care.";"During medical training, emotional burnout is commonly observed, driven by various structural and social factors. Students face overwhelming academic workloads, performance pressure, and high internal and external demands, contributing to chronic stress, anxiety, and fatigue. Major contributing factors include: an intense curriculum combining lectures, lab practices, clinical sessions, and long on-call shifts; normalized sleep deprivation in medical environments; irregular eating habits, lack of time for leisure and self-care and family and societal pressure for continuous excellence that fuels an unattainable ideal ofperfection.";At the end of the session, participants reported feelings of lightness, relaxation, relief, and well-being. Many also reported improvements in mild pain. The activity highlighted the value of integrative practices in self-care and stress management, broadening students' perception of complementary health care approaches.;Foot reflexology should be more widely promoted and implemented in health services due to its low cost and therapeutic benefits. Reflexology practitioners advocate its effectiveness in supporting general well-being and treating chronic conditions and stress. Being a non-invasive technique and well accepted by the public, its inclusion in holistic health care contexts can significantly contribute to humanized care.In this context, there is an urgent need to implement institutional strategies focused on physical and mental health and to value integrative practices as complementary tools for well-being. Foot reflexology presents itself as a relevant option, offering students an opportunity to reconnect with their own bodies, relieve stress, and promote physical and emotional balance.;"Integrative and Complementary Practices; Foot Reflexology; Medical Students; Integrative Medicine"

This East-West approach has proven to be safe, effective, and affordable, and has been promoted globally through a series of international training initiatives.
In 2011, the director of the Center, Dr. Hui, emphasized the importance of training more integrative primary care talents to Chinese integrative medicine (IM) professionals on an international conference held in Shanghai, and had the opportunity to present this idea to key leaders in Shanghai. Later between 2013 and 2016, the Center partnered with the Shanghai Association of Integrative Medicine (SAIM) under the leadership of its president, Prof. Wenjian Wang, to launch a 20 million Yuan government-funded training program for over 12,000 non-TCM community physicians and health workers. This 110-hour program equipped participants with basic TCM skills to meet growing demand for integrative services at the community level. Implemented in three phases, the program included curriculum development, large-scale in-person training, and the introduction of international best practices in community health. The Center participated in online modules, program design, and assessment.
In 2015, a one-year visit of Prof. Jing Zhao from China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences (CACMS), was inspired by the Center’s successful approach in training physicians with biomedical background in learning Chinese medicine. This has led to further collaboration upon her return. By 2017, Prof. Jing Zhao, with support from China’s Ministry of Science and Technology, launched a 2-week international training program in CACMS, Beijing, for biomedical-trained health professionals from developing countries, with the Center as co-organizer. Each cohort trained 20 participants and focuses on the latest clinical and research developments in IM. The program included global recruitment, a diverse curriculum of lectures, site visits, and practical sessions, and a post-training engagement mechanism to build international networks.
These two training projects illustrate the adaptability of the East-West integrative approach to different audiences-frontline clinicians and international medical leader-and highlight key strategies for effective dissemination. By presenting the Center’s experience, this paper aims to inform the development of globalization of IM.";"While the Center was committed to promoting the international application of IM, implementing large-scale training programs required substantial support and funding. This was especially true for the collaborative project in Shanghai, which involved a broad training scope and significant regional impact. Although the Center had proposed this idea in a paper published in 2011, it was not until 2013-when the Shanghai Office of Traditional Chinese Medicine issued a policy document on strengthening community-level TCM services-that the SAIM was able to take the lead in applying for and securing government funding. This critical financial support made it possible to successfully launch and implement the training program.
Another major challenge was how to effectively promote IM knowledge. In the Shanghai project, beyond securing government support, the program engaged 17 local health departments from various counties and districts. A strict code of conduct required participants to maintain over 95% attendance and achieve at least 90% on the final assessment to receive certification. Training performance was also tied to individual evaluations, enhancing both participation and skill acquisition. In the Beijing project, beyond in-person training, a sustainable information-sharing mechanism was created. Even during the COVID-19 pandemic, the program continued sharing IM knowledge and anti-epidemic practices through mutual medical supply donations and online meetings, significantly enhancing the training’s impact and continuity.";"In the Shanghai project, the Center participated in 110 hours of in-service training to four cohorts totaling 12,000 health professionals in Shanghai who had been trained in biomedicine. The training equipped them with up-to-date knowledge and practical skills in IM. Graduates who passed the assessments successfully applied the East-West model in grassroots healthcare settings, such as community clinics and primary hospitals, thereby improving access to safe, effective, and affordable medical services. In the Beijing project, the Center has trained approximately 80 biomedical health professionals from 18 countries and established collaborations with institutions such as Jagiellonian University in Poland and the Serbian Society of Integrative Medicine. These efforts have significantly contributed to the global recognition and dissemination of the East-West integrative medical model.
From these two projects, we can draw the following lessons: 1. Tailoring implementation strategies to specific audiences is crucial for advancing integrative healthcare models. In the Shanghai project, the primary goal was to apply IM approaches in primary care settings. Therefore, the training emphasized practical techniques and clinical methods. In contrast, the Beijing project aimed to use training as a platform to help trainees to have better understanding of the depth and breadth of IM in China. 2. Promoting IM internationally requires targeted partnerships with diverse institutions and organizations. Both projects show that collaboration with professional organizations related to IM significantly increases the likelihood of securing official support, achieving broader, higher-quality dissemination.";"In both of the above cases, our goals were successfully achieved- IM knowledge was effectively disseminated to the target audiences, and the projects generated sustainable impact. These successful experiences offer a model for collaboration with various types of international partners: beginning with in-depth communication to understand mutual needs, followed by the development of tailored cooperation plans and the pursuit of shared goals, ultimately advancing the global promotion of IM.
We hope that these lessons will offer practical, sustainable strategies and innovative pathways for future international collaboration, helping to foster the integration of Eastern and Western medicine and contribute meaningful solutions to pressing global health challenges.";"Integrative Medicine; East-West Model; Traditional Chinese Medicine; Globalization"

It has been widely implemented across Brazil through the SUS Integrative Practices Program [4,5]. This microsystem-based therapy has also been integrated within a spiritual context, in a large Universalist religious institution located in Rio de Janeiro. Combining healthcare with a biopsychosocial-spiritual approach, this model emphasizes a holistic view of the individual’s experience of illness and health, encompassing physical, social, emotional, and spiritual dimensions [6,7]. Auriculotherapy integrates multiple medical rationalities — understood as organized systems of knowledge and practices that guide different perspectives on health and disease. Among these are Reflexology, Neurophysiological Biomedicine, and Traditional Chinese Medicine [8]. In this spiritual context, Vibrational Medicine was integrated, recognizing the body's energy centers—as vital elements of the subtle energy system, culturally understood to be associated with multiple dimensions of physical, emotional, and spiritual well-being [9,10,11]. This report aims to describe the experience of implementing auriculotherapy in a spiritual context.
The practice is free of charge and carried out by trained volunteers of the institution, under the supervision of a healthcare professional certified in Auriculotherapy by UFSC/Ministry of Health (in Brazil) - all volunteers sign a confidentiality and non-disclosure agreement. Weekly sessions are held, typically ranging from 5 to 8 encounters, with duration of approximately 10 minutes, during which no more than 10 auricular points are stimulated. The methodology includes: (1) welcoming with a compassionate presence, followed by anamnesis and a comprehensive structured interview – on the first day; (2) application of mustard seeds on selected auricular points according to the main complaint — with therapists assigned randomly for each session [4]; (3) Laying on of hands over the auricular region and body areas corresponding to major chakras — a widely accepted practice across spiritual traditions, previously investigated in the context of pain management [9,10,11].
During the anamnesis, the following data are collected: sociodemographic characteristics, clinical history, medication use, complementary and spiritual practices, and the intensity and frequency of physical and emotional pain (before, during, and after treatment), using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS).
All individuals who seek this practice at the institution receive care from a team of trained volunteers and all information is stored in the Institution’s Historical Records, with informed consent from each participant, in accordance with Law No. 13.709/2018 (General Law for the Protection of Personal Data – LGPD).";This institutional initiative promotes care within a spiritual context for individuals experiencing suffering and social vulnerability that embraces diverse beliefs without engaging in religious proselytism. The approach expands care through a biopsychosocial-spiritual model, enhances scientific inquiry in naturalistic and community-based contexts, and values complementary health practices as part of a broader model of care — one that requires rigorous investigation without relinquishing epistemological courage.;;"A key challenge lies in consolidating the scientific legitimacy of integrative practices applied in spiritual and religious settings. Additional challenges include the continued systematization of collected data, the strengthening of volunteer therapist training, the refinement of the care protocol, and the promotion of scientific dissemination of this experience through naturalistic research within and outside spiritual contexts, including comparisons between both contexts as conducted previously in studies involving other practices [10].
It is recommended to encourage researchers to investigate the effects of these practices in such settings, recognizing the importance of overcoming the reluctance to study spiritual contexts - acknowledging that science is ultimately shaped by what scientists choose to explore [12].

Both professionals were active in Primary Health Care and already trained as community therapists.
The initiative aimed to expand mental health access due to long wait times for psychological care, focusing on individuals in distress regardless of diagnosis (Municipal Health Council, 2022).
In 2019, the practice was incorporated into the Municipal Health Plan following its approval at the 13th Municipal Health Conference. Later, during the 14th Conference in 2022, the expansion of ICT was approved, integrating it into the care network of the Psychosocial Care Network (PCN) (Piraquara, 2017; Municipal Health Council, 2019; 2022).
Thus, this experience report aims to present medical students’ reflections, as participants of the sessions, on the integration of ICT into the mental health care pathway in Piraquara, Paraná.";"The welcoming space of ICT also serves as a health education setting, fostering student engagement with the community and promoting the development of humanistic skills and competencies essential for more sensitive and comprehensive health care.
Thus, 54 students participated in the sessions between May 2024 and June 2025, of both sexes, aged between 20 and 25 years. Among them were undergraduate medical students and Family and Community Medicine residents, who completed a form to record their reflections on the integration of ICT into the mental health care pathway in the municipality of Piraquara. Thematic analysis was based on the most frequently addressed topics (Piraquara, 2025).
Between May 2024 and June 2025, 54 medical and residency students participated in ICT sessions and completed reflection forms. A thematic analysis was conducted based on the most frequently mentioned topics (Piraquara, 2025).
ICT has become an important strategy in health education, promoting experiential learning through student participation in community-based care. It encourages reflection on ""light technologies"" such as active listening, welcoming, and community bonding, in alignment with public policies like the National Humanization Policy and the National Policy on Integrative and Complementary Practices.";"Among the main outcomes, the integration of ICT into mental health care in the municipality was highlighted, emphasizing facilitated access, welcoming approaches, the strengthening of user-provider bonds, and interdisciplinary teamwork.
Health education strategies and the recognition of ICT as a Brazilian Integrative and Complementary Practice were also mentioned, along with person-centered care—all identified as strengthening elements of the Psychosocial Care Network.
ICT was recognized for its complementary role in the prevention and treatment of psychosocial distress, as well as in promoting relational bonds and community strengthening. Another relevant point raised by the students was the successful implementation of ICT in Piraquara, considered a positive example that could inspire similar initiatives in other municipalities.
Some weaknesses were also identified, such as the low student participation in collective activities—only 26.3% had experienced this type of engagement—and limited knowledge about PICS, reported by only 40% of participants.
Overall, the experience allowed students to reflect on practice and identify elements that strengthen the mental health care pathway, while also emphasizing the importance of the broader care network. As such, the formative potential of ICT was highly valued and qualified.";"There are still several challenges to consolidating ICT as a sustainable public policy. Key issues include the lack of permanent public funding and the need for continuing education—both outlined in the PNPIC as responsibilities of federal, state, and municipal governments. Another challenge is the limited integration of PICS, particularly ICT, into undergraduate curricula, restricting students’ experiential and critical engagement with these practices in academic settings.
It is recommended that HEIs include PICS in their curricula and promote interdisciplinary learning to enhance student experience. These actions support the training of professionals for comprehensive care and reinforce ICT as a key strategy in mental and community health. The findings highlight the need to ensure the continuity and expansion of ICT within the public health system and psychosocial care network.";"Integrative Community Therapy; Psychosocial Care; Medical Students"

Implemented between 2023 and 2025, the course consists of three modules delivered over 18 months, comprising five in-person sessions per module, each lasting three hours. The curriculum incorporates body–mind techniques derived from Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), such as Qi Gong, Ba Duan Jin, Lian Gong, self-massage, breathing techniques, meditation, joint mobilization, and meridian activation.

Occupational risks related to poor posture and repetitive strain are widely recognized among students and healthcare professionals. In this context, TCM-based practices—combining breathing, posture, and mental focus—were introduced as a strategy to restore balance, improve body awareness, and promote self-care. These practices are officially recognized within Brazil’s public health system and have shown promising results in enhancing physical and emotional well-being.

In this implementation, each session offered a thematic focus and a safe, restorative space. The pedagogical approach emphasized embodied learning. Student feedback revealed that the integration of these practices fostered a range of benefits, including improved posture, physical conditioning, emotional regulation, and the development of therapeutic skills. Students reported sleeping better, breathing more deeply, and feeling more focused and calm. The practices were also seen as accessible, inclusive, and effective when practiced consistently. These outcomes reinforce the role of TCM-based techniques in promoting well-being and professional preparedness in vocational health education.";"This initiative was developed to address three main issues in vocational health education. First, massage therapy students are vulnerable to occupational health problems such as repetitive strain injuries, physical fatigue, and emotional stress, yet curricula rarely offer structured time or strategies for self-care. Second, there is a need to move beyond the traditional biomedical model and include integrative practices in training programs—especially those already supported by public health policies. Third, many professionals lack preparation to recommend or apply complementary therapies in clinical contexts, limiting their ability to promote integral health care and preventive care. The inclusion of TCM-based body–mind practices aimed to fill these gaps by strengthening personal health management and clinical competence.

";"Student testimonials collected at the end of the course revealed a broad range of personal, pedagogical, and professional benefits. These insights offer a deeper understanding of how the learning and practice of body–mind techniques contributed to students’ development across multiple dimensions and were thematically organized into the following categories:

Under the theme of body awareness and physical health, students described the techniques as “a way to reorganize, strengthen, and activate the entire body through subtle movements, gentle breathing, and wide gestures.” These embodied experiences fostered an increased sense of proprioception, postural alignment, and physical balance—skills crucial not only for self-care but also for safe therapeutic practice.

In terms of occupational preparedness, students emphasized that the practices helped “strengthen muscles, joints, body, and mind—essential for applying therapeutic techniques.” This feedback highlights the preventive potential of these exercises for musculoskeletal strain, as well as their contribution to sustaining long-term clinical performance. Participants reported feeling more confident in their physical readiness for hands-on work.

In the realm of personal development and self-care, the practices were described as having “helped me manage stress and develop body awareness—essential for a massage therapist.” The integration of mindful movement and breathing into their routine supported emotional resilience, grounding, and the development of healthier work-life habits. Several students highlighted that these techniques offered relief from anxiety and fatigue.

The dimension of mental and emotional health was strongly present in student reflections. Comments such as “I’m sleeping better, breathing more deeply, and staying calmer and more centered” illustrate the psychosomatic benefits reported. These changes were often perceived as interconnected with increased concentration, mood stability, and emotional presence—important for both learning and therapeutic relationships.

The course also demonstrated relevance for patient outcomes and health education. As one student noted, the practices “can be taught to clients to extend session benefits and foster a sense of care and loyalty.” This points to a transformation not only in students’ personal habits but in their therapeutic vision—seeing themselves as educators and facilitators of self-care beyond the treatment room.

From a pedagogical perspective, students saw the component as integral to their education: “This course component was essential in expanding my understanding of Lian Gong and Qi Gong.” The structure of the course enabled not just physical practice, but also theoretical contextualization, creating meaningful connections between traditional health philosophies and their contemporary application.

Finally, many highlighted the inclusive and accessible nature of the practices, calling them “a democratic and inclusive practice with few contraindications, yielding excellent results when done consistently.” This perception reinforces the appropriateness of these techniques for diverse populations and settings, particularly in public healthcare and community-based work.

Overall, these testimonies affirm that the integration of TCM-based practices cultivated not only technical competencies but also reflective, empathic, and resilient professional identities. The course helped shape a more humanized, preventive, and sustainable vision of healthcare, aligned with contemporary challenges in public health and education.";"This integrative pedagogical model can be adapted to other health education programs—especially in fields where professionals face physical or emotional risks and can apply integrative techniques to benefit clients. Physical education, nursing, and physical therapy are examples of areas where promoting self-care and preventive approaches is highly relevant.
One key challenge is institutional support for embedding body-based integrative practices into formal curricula, which requires interdisciplinary collaboration and policy engagement.";"Complementary Therapies; Qigong; mind-body therapies; Self-Care; breathing exercises"

Upon completing his studies, Bach correlated the emotional states of a person with the flower essences he produced. The purpose of Flower Therapy is to restore the positive state of the human personality by using flower essences to care for mental, emotional, and behavioral aspects of people. It can be used preventively, encouraging the concept of self-care and individual and collective care. (MINISTRY OF HEALTH - BRASIL, 2016)
The therapy is based on a concept that overcomes the Cartesian division between body and mind with a perspective that integrates these elements into a dimension in which the mind assumes essential importance, since emotions alter the physical state through the action of the central nervous system. Positive emotions establish health, while negative states stimulate disease—hence the importance of speaking of ""emotional health.""
With this very particular and unique perspective, these implementations use the Saint Germain Flower Remedies system, which was developed in the 1990s by researcher Neide Margonari.
The excerpt below describes what flower essences are, as well as supports their use and effectiveness, considering that:
Flower essences are natural, odorless, and highly diluted liquid extracts of flowers intended to balance emotional problems, operating on subtle levels and harmonizing the individual internally and with their surroundings. They are prepared from wildflowers at their peak of bloom, in the early morning hours, when the flowers are still damp with dew, obtained by harvesting flowers from untouched natural locations. The flower essence, which originates from the flowering plant, acts on the archetypes of the human soul, stimulating positive transformation in thought patterns and fostering inner development and emotional balance that leads to new behaviors. It is not a herbal remedy, fragrance, homeopathy, or drug. It can be used at any age, without interfering with other therapeutic methods and/or medications, enhancing them. The effects can be observed immediately in more sensitive individuals. (MINISTRY OF HEALTH - BRASIL, 2018).

With this humanized and effective perspective provided by Flower Therapy, a movement began in 2018 to insert this practice into the Unified Health System/SUS, in Mato Grosso do Sul, when managers concerned and committed to their employees sought in Flower Therapy an effective implementation of “look” and “care” for this portion of citizens through the project “Caring for Those Who Care”.

THE IMPLEMENTATION OF FLOWER THERAPY IN THE STATE OF MATO GROSSO DO SUL - BRASIL
In the state of Mato Grosso do Sul, the introduction of a PIC, Flower Therapy, began in 2019 (specifically in March) in the municipality of Corguinho, Mato Grosso do Sul. Initially, Flower Therapy was introduced through informative lectures and personalized, welcoming and qualified sessions called ""therapeutic listening sessions,"" held twice a month.
The municipality of Angélica-MS also began to be served with Floral Therapy with the same protocols of lectures and personalized services, with the only difference being that, there, the assistance offered was four days a month. 
“Caring for the Caregiver,” directing special attention to healthcare professionals who are on the “front lines” on a daily basis, was the driving force behind the introduction of this therapy.
It is identified that Health Units have complexity and specific characteristics, however, these characteristics may change and acquire peculiarities depending on sectoral, municipal, state and national situations and, therefore, it is up to the therapist to integrate into the teams, facilitating the work axis and its functionality.
Along with providing services to employees, months later we began integrating and working on the insertion of flower therapy into the actions of the Family Health Strategies - ESF, in the aforementioned municipalities and, to this end, we entered the Hiperdia, smoking, mental health and women's health programs, aiming to look at the human being and their emotions in all stages of life.
";"One negative aspect is the lack of awareness of PICS across all levels.
It's important to emphasize that each implementation has its own characteristics, whether in management, the operating format of the Family Health Strategies (ESF), or the personality of the unit coordinators.
For the insertion of integrative and complementary practices - PICS we have to validate that the therapist needs to have some important prerequisites such as: validated training of the practice to be applied, fluency and empathy, understanding of the unit's routine, proactivity, knowing how to deal with users' difficulties at their different levels of education, understanding the reality of each user, having active listening and practicing welcoming, complementing and respecting the space of each professional to be able, in a simple way, to integrate into the network of health professionals/therapist/SUS user to, in this way, strengthen the ""gear"" of primary care.
";"Reports from users and collaborators indicate that the provision of floral therapy by the municipal SUS (Unified Health System) has led to perceived improvements in emotional quality of life, enabling acceptance, sharing, and accessible care.
Among the many reports, one topic that stands out is frequently mentioned in requests and feedback during (re)consultations and consultations: ""emotional quality of life."" This topic is recurrent because users are able to perceive their emotions and deal with them, and to process and express their personal needs.
";"""Caring for the Caregiver,"" directing special attention to healthcare professionals on the ""front lines"" on a daily basis, was the driving force behind the introduction of this therapy, stemming from managers' concern for the ""integral health of workers,"" based on the concept that ""people can only offer what they have."" Therefore, it is understood that caring for employees is, and always will be, the gateway to Integrative and Complementary Health Practices.";"Flower Therapy; Implementation of PICS in Hospital Complexes; health promotion; Occupational Health"

In this context, integrative and complementary health practices (PIS) emerge as promising allies. Among ICHPs, Reflexology stands out as a recognized therapeutic technique that applies pressure to reflex points on the hands and feet to promote organic balance, demonstrating relevant benefits in improving users' quality of life. The integration of foot care recommended by national and international guidelines with the fundamentals of Reflexology, guided by Traditional Chinese Medicine principles, forms a valuable strategy for health professionals in preventive actions targeting people with diabetes.
This approach was applied in training a group of elderly individuals with diabetes during a group therapeutic meeting held at a reference unit in Goiânia – GO, Brazil. The activity was led by a multidisciplinary team from the Reference Center for Elderly Care (CRASPI), in partnership with the ""Pegando no Pé"" Project from the Liga Multiferidas and NUTADIES/UFG. The therapeutic group is structured into five meetings, addressing themes aligned with the daily demands of diabetes mellitus (DM) self-management. In the meeting described in this report, principles of foot care aimed at preventing ulcerations were discussed, incorporating pedal and palmar reflex stimulation as complementary strategies. The methodological approach adopted was problem-solving, utilizing experiential activities and practical demonstrations, fostering active learning and participant engagement.";Recognizing the challenge of implementing structured educational activities for foot care, the integration of PIS modalities into educational interventions, as well as their inclusion in protocols for self-management of Diabetes-Related Foot Disease (DRFD), appears promising. Specifically, from this reported experience, it was possible to observe participants' involvement in each proposed activity, demonstrated by their responses to questions about the content covered and sharing of personal experiences. On the other hand, the organization of systematic and reproducible educational interventions on this topic for this target population, which are also meaningful to participants, also presents a challenge. Thus, this experience contributes to addressing this demand through the development of a protocol for educational intervention for DRFD self-management with a dialogical and proactive, less prescriptive approach, structured on theoretical assumptions of supported self-care and Traditional Chinese Medicine.;"During the meeting, significant engagement with the presented techniques was observed. The contextualization of the content in relation to daily practices demonstrated the usefulness and relevance of the adopted approach. The integration of Traditional Chinese Medicine Fundamentals—applied to reflexology through hand and foot self-massage—and foot care principles for people with diabetes (such as systematic inspection, hygiene, hydration, and identification of warning signs for pre-ulcerative lesions) awakened participants to a more attentive view of the importance of daily self-care for preventing DRFD complications. Furthermore, group discussions on the applicability of the techniques in daily life contributed to understanding the content and encouraged the adoption of learned practices as part of their routine. At the end, a booklet containing foot care information and a plantar reflexology map was provided. A musical experience involving a circle dance with foot choreography to folk music was also conducted. This last activity is understood to have reinforced the value of integrating traditional knowledge and scientific guidelines into a single intervention, promoting not only the prevention of diabetes complications but also attention to quality of life through self-care.
";Training and monitoring people with diabetes for self-management of foot care represents an ongoing challenge for professionals serving this population. While the benefits of PIS in the health of people with non-communicable chronic diseases like diabetes are observed in literature and clinical practice, they often occur as isolated activities. The proposed integration of reflexology and self-massage into the range of preventive care for diabetes complications in the feet, as evidenced in technical-scientific literature recommendations, constitutes a promising strategy to be encouraged for its potential to promote self-care and contribute to improving the quality of life for these individuals.;"Reflexotherapy; Diabetes Mellitus; Diabetic Foot; Nursing Care"

Because it's part of the Unified Health System (SUS), it's free and supports the fundamental premise of inclusion and democratization of access to quality public health care. Mental health service users who receive treatment at the institution participate alongside the community, which uses these services.The second group is located at CAPS Clarice Lispector, another facility in the Psychosocial Care Network, neighboring IMASNS, and was inaugurated in June 2025. It has approximately 25 students per week, among mental health professionals and users with intense psychological distress resulting from serious and persistent mental problems, including those related to the needs arising from the harmful use of alcohol and other drugs, and other clinical situations that make it impossible to establish social ties and carry out life projects. Biodanza is a system of human development and social transformation that uses music, meaningful movement, and group experiences as a way to access emotions and reconnect with the individual's emotional bonds with themselves, others (their fellow human beings), and the cosmos—which organizes all forms of life—in a balanced, living, and pulsating rhythm. This system has been present in over 200 countries worldwide for over 60 years and promotes holistic health. It follows a biocentric vision that places life at the center, valuing all forms of existence. It is a primarily experiential therapeutic system—which is why it is best understood when experienced through its invitation to dance the life that reveals itself in the movement that pulses within each of us.

The integration of human identity is the motto of Biodanza: thinking, feeling, and acting in harmonious consonance. To achieve this, it is necessary to progressively reclaim the knowledge of our instincts. This often dormant (and undervalued in capitalist society) understanding of our body: tissues, organs, and cells. Aligned with our ability to read the world through signs and thought, nature and culture can thus be integrated in a balanced way that promotes life.

Each weekly session lasts an average of two hours and takes place in a rich, safe, and welcoming environment: through experiences—in the here and now, in a state of presence—based on musical semantics, with a selection of organic music that stimulates specific affective states, according to the theme proposed in each class.";"This work involves mental health projects with Biodanza groups that welcome a segment of the population often marginalized by society—due to their specific nature and the prejudice that excludes them from the activities and resources offered by the Unified Health System (SUS). Biodanza in mental health is therefore invited to flow and expand its boundaries, to embrace the uniqueness and diversity of the individuals it welcomes. Building this work requires listening, soulfulness, creativity, and a dose of boldness.

It's important to note that IMASNS is a century-old institution, once one of the largest psychiatric hospitals in Latin America. It recently ended its psychiatric admissions and deinstitutionalized all former residents, discharged from long-term psychiatric hospitalizations, in 2021. This ensures care in freedom and the expansion of its health promotion services to the general population through activities mediated by sports, art, and culture, as well as community outreach initiatives that value local knowledge and traditions.

It is also part of a larger project in which old, decommissioned mental health buildings will be demolished to make way for a wooded park open to the community.

Despite its transformation over the past few decades, it still carries the stigma that surrounds and imprisons madness, and is still remembered by the neighborhood and in the public imagination as the ""Hospital for the Mad."" In this sense, we continue to carry out extensive awareness-raising and social awareness work to welcome and include differences.";They quickly reveal transformative effects, as seen through the testimonies of students and professionals involved. Biodanza for mental health has proven to be much simpler than one might imagine and even more powerful than one might imagine.;"It is understood that the recovery of our humanity, which Biodanza proposes, through the strengthening of the sense of collectivity and the flourishing of nature within us all, produces health, well-being, and a new lifestyle.

The inclusion of Biodanza as integrative care in the field of mental health clinics is a fertile field, still little explored, that aligns with the motto of the anti-asylum struggle—for a society without asylums, nor any form of violence, oppression, or silencing of individuals.

The proposal of Biodanza classes allows the group to embrace differences and progressively restore people's dignity. By placing life at the center, above any prejudice, we are invited to occupy the center of the circle, taking our place in existence. As subjects who have a place, a voice, and a unique understanding of themselves, others, and the universe around us. Dancing together, we call upon the Unified Health System (SUS) itself to its original movement—reclaiming its vocation as a promoter of health and a facilitator of life processes.

This is the political, social, and emotional importance of Biodanza's inclusion in Mental Health. It is from this place of knowledge, extensive study, and affection that I listen and lead the groups. At each meeting, I witness—within the group—the power of PICS in building a more just, egalitarian, and humane world.

In Rio de Janeiro, we currently have only three active Biodanza groups. Encouraging Integrative and Complementary Health Practices (PICS) is essential, both in terms of their widespread dissemination and availability within the public health system and in terms of creating a dedicated budget for the program, which would enable the expansion of services offered to the population and ensure the hiring of competent professionals to practice these PICS.";"Biodanza; mental health; Unified Health System (SUS); Integrative and Complementary Health Practices (PICS); Psychosocial Care Center (CAPS)"

?Physiotherapy and music therapy sessions occurred simultaneously in the pediatric physiotherapy room. Thus, the work was carried out interdisciplinarily, aiming at the holistic care of the patient; that is, integrative care through music therapy, which has a global view of the subject's health and not only on their symptomatology and pathological etiology, but how this impacts the patient's quality of life as a whole. 
One of the cases attended by music therapy was a 3-year-old patient diagnosed with mixed Cerebral Palsy (ataxic and hypotonic) and tetraparesis. During the first sessions, cognitive, motor, speech, and bonding delays were identified, which were worked on in music therapy sessions. The objectives were to establish a bond so that the mother was not requested by the patient during the sessions, to replace crying as a form of communication with verbalization, proprioception, motor stability, and executive function.";"In speech, we used songs known by the patient with simple expressions and onomatopoeias, associated movements with sounds, and used the provocative technique (BARCELLOS, 2008), which consists of leaving gaps in the song to be filled by the patient. In motor skills and executive function, we worked with fingerpicking on the guitar, focusing on fine motor skills in this activity; gross motor skills were also worked on using rhythm on the guitar and drum, proprioception with the guitar, gait using rhythm, among other activities. To create a bond with the patient, to facilitate adherence to treatment, we used the sound envelope technique (CHAGAS, 2003), which aims to ""embrace"" the patient sonorously, providing a welcoming environment for them to feel comfortable.";"?Significant improvements were observed throughout the therapeutic process, as in one session the patient verbalized ""I liked it"" when we signaled that the session was coming to an end, in others they said ""no"" when they did not want to do the activity and asked for the song ""Five Little Ducks"" by saying the word ""duck"". At another moment, we observed that the rattle was outside its circumference, so the patient stretched to pick it up and did so successfully, experimented with ways to make sounds on the guitar associating them with onomatopoeias, maintained a rhythm initiated by them on the back of the guitar, and walked with the help of the music therapy team to the waiting room, with their gait marked by the rhythm of a nursery rhyme (short stories whose verses rhyme and have a rhythm when told), which was presented to them in the session.";The bond was established, as was adherence to treatment, and, little by little, the mother's presence was no longer requested by the child. The patient's attention proved to be more lasting, being fully present for longer in the sessions. Music therapy work was carried out by the music therapist and the music therapy intern. The patient also underwent other therapies, such as physiotherapy and speech therapy. Music therapy sessions contributed to the child's adherence to treatment, facilitating the therapeutic bond in both therapies. Motor skills were a mutual therapeutic objective, and advancements were perceived in both physiotherapy and music therapy sessions. Observing the results, we can conclude that the objectives outlined at the beginning were met and the patient showed significant improvements.;"Music Therapy; Cerebral Palsy; Neuropediatric Rehabilitation; Integrative and complementary health practices"

The network was created to promote the expansion and dissemination of PICS knowledge through collaborative efforts focused on teaching, research, extension, and assistance. The PICS UFRJ Network was formed in March 2018 at a meeting attended by professors, technicians, and students from various university departments. The Network received institutional recognition in October 2018 from the Deliberative Council of the Center for Health Sciences.The Network's initial objectives were to facilitate communication and interaction among members, expand knowledge about PICS by creating undergraduate or graduate courses and extension courses to inform or train the public, promote scientific meetings to disseminate integrative practices, stimulate the development of PICS extension and research, and develop actions focused on PICS care for the university's internal and external public. In November 2018, the III PICS Meeting of UFRJ was held, organized by the Network. The central theme of this meeting was PICS care in different locations of the university, as well as the presentation of research and extension projects developed at that time. In the field of education, the inclusion of PICS in undergraduate and graduate programs was discussed, with a focus on the prospect of creating a Music Therapy Course at UFRJ. The following year, the undergraduate course in music therapy was established, and the elective course ""Introduction to Integrative and Complementary Health Practices"" began, offered jointly by the nursing, pharmacy, medicine, and nutrition courses at the UFRJ-Macaé Multidisciplinary Center. At the end of 2020, the PICS UFRJ Network held an internal online seminar in which the previous objectives were reaffirmed. However, the shift to online work processes and social isolation due to the pandemic made it difficult to maintain these objectives and scheduled activities. In 2024, the IV PICS Meeting was held at UFRJ, aiming to revitalize the PICS UFRJ Network, disseminate and discuss the activities carried out at the university.Round tables were held to discuss teaching, research, extension, and assistance at UFRJ.";In 2020, the pandemic struck. Due to the consequences of social isolation and excessive online work, Network members took leave due to illness, interrupting activities from 2021 to 2023. Another factor that restricted the Network's development was the difficulty of expanding assistance activities with integrative practices to the internal and external public due to a lack of awareness about their importance and the absence of an institutional organization that promotes their effective implementation at the university. ;When planning the IV PICS Meeting, a Google Form survey was conducted on activities involving integrative practices at the university. Twenty professors and thirteen technicians responded to the survey. The professors are from different academic units in Rio de Janeiro and Macaé, and they noted that the activities emphasize Teaching and Research more than Extension. Only professors from the undergraduate course in music therapy develop activities in assistance. The most cited PICS were: Medicinal Plants and Phytotherapy, Reiki, Floral Therapy, Meditation, Yoga, Music Therapy, and Ayurveda. The technicians with PICS training are few in number and are located in different units in Rio de Janeiro. They responded that their activities emphasize assistance more than teaching, research, and extension. The most cited PICS were: Traditional Chinese medicine, floral therapy, Reiki, music therapy, homeopathy, aromatherapy, and auriculotherapy. The oldest teaching initiatives are from the Pharmacy Course, with undergraduate and graduate programs. Next is the undergraduate Music Therapy Course and the elective course about PICS in Macaé. In 2024, another Introduction to PICS course was started in Rio de Janeiro among the undergraduate courses in Music Therapy, Nursing, Occupational Therapy, and Pharmacy. In healthcare, care for the population has been developed by technicians for a longer time at the São Francisco de Assis Teaching Hospital (HESFA), in primary healthcare. Teachers from the Music Therapy Course and music therapy technicians provide care for the population at the Maternity School, Institute of Psychiatry, Institute of Neurology, and School of Music. The Humanization and Welcome Sector has developed assistance for the internal public for several years, with technicians and volunteers offering care through different PICS aimed at promoting the health of students, technicians, and teachers. Regarding the extension and research of PICS, it has become clear that these are individual initiatives with limited integration within the network. At the conclusion of the IV PICS meeting, the need to establish an Integrative Health Center at UFRJ was discussed. This center would facilitate the integration and development of PICS, enabling the expansion of teaching, research, extension, and assistance to internal and external public. ;Create Extension and Research Programs in PICS to integrate participants from the academic community. These programs would expand knowledge and scientific dissemination while contributing to community care. It is essential to institutionalize Integrative Health Centers in public universities to expand knowledge and care in PICS.;"Complementary Therapies; Science and Technology Information Networks; Teaching; Community Health Services; Strategic Research"

APC is 17 years old , with the main objective of offering neuro-functional physiotherapy to people with Parkinson's disease, aiding an average of 90 patients per month at a rate of twice a week. It also offers massage therapy, dance for Parkinson's, art therapy, legal support, as well as guidance and support for families and caregivers.

The Brazilian Society of Neurology1 defines Parkinson's disease as ""a chronic and progressive neurological condition resulting from the degeneration of brain cells that produce dopamine, a neurotransmitter crucial for movement control. This degeneration leads to motor symptoms such as tremors, slowness of movement, rigidity, and postural instability, as well as non-motor symptoms that can affect sleep, mood, cognition, and other functions."" The most obvious symptoms are bradykinesia, tremor, rigidity, lack of balance, as well as sleep disorders, depression, anxiety, irritability, difficulty concentrating and reasoning, memory lapses, as well as possible loss of smell, constipation, pain, fatigue, among others. 
 
The diagnosis is clinical, and treatment combines dopaminergic medication with rehabilitation and, in some cases, surgery to implant DBS (deep brain stimulation) to relieve tremors and rigidity. Rehabilitation includes neurofunctional physical therapy, speech therapy, occupational therapy, and also various PICS (Integrative and Complementary Practices in Health), among which is PETER HESS® SOUND THERAPY, which is the practice we would like to report on here. 

Peter Hess® Sound Therapy is a vibro-acoustic technique for deep relaxationii, which has been refined since 1984, based on the methodology created by German engineer Peter Hess. It uses therapeutic-quality metal singing bowls, specially developed for working on the body. They are made of a bronze alloy (with other metals), which emit frequencies that resonate with the body. They come in different sizes and, during the session, are placed on (or near) the clothed patient and, when lightly struck with a specific mallet, emit sound and vibration, creating resonance with the body, promoting balance and harmony on a physical, mental, emotional, and energetic/spiritual leveliii.

Sound Therapy acts deeply, reaching even cellular structures, moving the energy of the recipient, providing internal reorganization, with the body's liquid medium as the conductor. It is based on the principle that all living beings are vibrating systems. When this vibration system becomes unbalanced, the sounds and vibrations of therapeutic bowls can help harmonize the body, mind, and spirit, so that the person rediscovers their own vibrational frequency in their cellular memory.""

We want to highlight the benefits that this practice provides to the population served, in the context of the experience gathered during this period.

We have been working at APC since 2017, during this time we have provided approximately 1,500 consultations. We offer sessions twice a week. We see up to six patients per day in 50-minute sessions. Participation and attendance are voluntary. 
Due to the progressive rigidity of the disease, patients choose the best position for themselves on the stretcher or sitting up on a chair. 

The three practitioners are trained in Peter Hess® Sound Therapy. In 2017, we started a pilot research project under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Wilma Costa Souza, with a group of nine patients, where validated questionnaires were used, and we obtained positive results in relation to the improvement in quality of lifeiv.";The main challenges encountered were: the lack of a suitable location for the sessions and the irregularity in the frequency of the sessions. This makes it difficult to “allow” relaxation, which is the basis of PH Sound Therapy, and the adequate monitoring of the evolution of the patients' issues.;"The beneficial effects of Peter Hess® Sound Therapy are many, and we can observe in patients who receive regular sessions, as well as from the feedback they give us, that: they achieve deep relaxation that helps reduce stress, decrease anxiety and fears, improving sleep quality, self-perception, and body awareness; they increase their self-esteem and self-confidence, dealing more positively with the challenges of the disease and everyday life; improved muscle and joint stiffness, relief from pain in general, and a visible reduction in tremors during the session; improved voice projection, postural balance, and gait development; in some cases, episodes of “freezing” were reduced, and constipation improved.";"The initial goal was achieved, but it can be improved to benefit more patients.

To do this, we need to create a space that provides the necessary relaxation, promote actions to raise patient awareness about PH Sound Massage and the importance of maintaining regularity in the frequency of sessions, as this is what will stimulate the body's response, directly impacting the results of the beneficial effects.

Peter Hess® Sound Therapy is used as a complement to healthcare in various therapeutic areas. Our experience shows that other groups of patients whose health conditions involve anxiety, stress, sleep disorders, and pain in general, can greatly benefit from the effects of Peter Hess® Sound Therapy.

On the other hand, there is the issue of the literature on Peter Hess Sound Massage, which is still concentrated on publications in Germany in German, making it difficult to disseminate the method and concentrating the practice among a few professionals, ultimately restricting interest in more comprehensive research, despite the growing interest of neuroscience in the function of sound vibrations for human health.

Its aim is to strengthen, systematize, and give visibility to complementary health practices rooted in traditional communities.

Approximately 80% of the global population uses medicinal plants as a therapeutic resource (BRASIL, 2006). The World Health Organization (WHO) recognizes the contribution of traditional medicine in providing health care, especially in areas with limited access to formal health services. In Brazil, the National Policy on Integrative and Complementary Practices promotes the organic cultivation of medicinal plants and the integration of traditional knowledge into primary healthcare services (BRASIL, 2006a).

In recent decades, studies in ethnobotany and ethnopharmacology have increasingly valued traditional knowledge about medicinal plants, integrating it with scientific knowledge. However, Afro-Brazilian religious communities (terreiros) are still not adequately recognized as spaces of care and healing. As sites for the preservation of African-based religions and as welcoming spaces for historically marginalized groups, it is essential to promote actions that recover, value, and destigmatize their therapeutic knowledge (OLIVEIRA, 2002).

In this context, the Ewé Collective was founded in 2021 and has been holding biweekly meetings in a hybrid format (in-person and virtual) at FIOCRUZ in Rio de Janeiro. Its goal is to foster learning and sharing about the use of medicinal plants in both traditional and scientific medicine among researchers, public managers, community leaders, Babalorixás, Yalorixás, and other interested individuals. The collective promotes dialogue between the traditional knowledge practiced in terreiros and the scientific knowledge applied by the Brazilian Unified Health System (SUS). Ewé organizes lectures, debates, and gatherings focused on traditional knowledge, medicinal plants, and health, emphasizing popular wisdom and promoting the exchange of ancestral knowledge to strengthen natural care practices for health and well-being.

The Ewé Collective currently has 61 members, 44 of whom are practitioners of Afro-Brazilian religions such as Candomblé and Umbanda. The group includes 12 religious leaders, 5 community leaders, 3 environmental educators, 6 researchers, and 3 health professionals.
The meetings began as a study group on plants used in Afro-Brazilian religions, covering scientific, popular, and ceremonial names, as well as cultural, medicinal, economic, and environmental aspects. With the expansion of public activities, such as healing circles, gatherings, and collective work efforts, the group adopted the name collective.

As the meetings evolved, beyond structured studies, members began sharing practical experiences such as the preparation of tinctures, teas, foot soaks, syrups, ointments, and more. Initially coordinated by a small leadership team, the meetings gradually shifted to active participation by members, many of whom presented studies and shared traditional practices. This experience inspired several participants to continue their studies, including in postgraduate programs.

Ethnobotany in this context reveals the Afro-descendant identity resistance by connecting traditional knowledge from Yoruba, Fon, and Bantu peoples to ancestral plant practices (BENISTE, 2000; CARNEY, 2001; GOMES, 2009; PESSOA DE BARROS, 2000; VERGER, 1996).
In May 2025, the collective established a coordination structure composed of a general coordinator, event coordinator, social media coordinator, communication coordinator, and documentation coordinator.
";"The Ewé Collective meetings have generated an up-to-date database of knowledge and practices, contributing to IdeiaSUS, a collaborative platform that gathers numerous experiences based on ancestral health practices using medicinal plants (www.ideiasus.fiocruz.br). This dissemination facilitates the reapplication of intangible cultural heritage and fosters the creation of innovative health solutions to be incorporated into SUS across different territories in Brazil.
";"As an outcome, the Ewé Collective works to gain recognition for traditional knowledge and popular medical practices within terreiros, utilizing plants as a form of integrative and complementary health care. The group is part of broader struggles and mobilizations within traditional communities. It addresses the challenge of advocating for the decolonization of power, knowledge, and being, by engaging with the complex systems that underpin traditional healing practices (FANON, 2005; FRANCO, 2011; MALDONADO-TORRES, 2016; MIGNOLO, 2008, 2017; QUIJANO, 2005, 2007; SANTOS, 2009; TAVARES, 2009).

The collective’s meetings highlight the importance of ethnobotany as a field of knowledge concerned with plant use by different cultures. The knowledge surrounding the use of leaves for health promotion and religious practice by Afro-descendant communities offers valuable insights rooted in knowledge exchange.

The Ewé Collective also serves as the foundation for the ""Plantando Saúde"" (Planting Health) project, coordinated by Fiocruz. The project promotes food sovereignty and security through the establishment of community gardens and health promotion workshops in 16 traditional communities, including 3 quilombos, 3 Umbanda houses, 9 Candomblé houses, and 1 Ifá temple. It aims to foster sustainability in these territories and affirm the universality of the SUS.

Some of these communities, such as Morro do Salgueiro, Quilombo AQUILAH, Hunpame Mahi Kwe Naiye, and Ilé Omi Ojuaro, are engaged in joint actions with the SUS. However, scaling this strategy remains a major challenge for the collective.

The Ewé Collective will host the 3rd Meeting on Traditional Knowledge, Medicinal Plants, and Health in November 2025 and will expand documentation of its activities through IdeiaSUS.
";"Despite being embedded within a renowned science and public health institution, the Ewé Collective still faces significant legal barriers favoring the pharmaceutical industry over the advancement of traditional health practices. It is essential to promote exchange between different healthcare systems and to recognize traditional healers and the popular medicines practiced by various Afro-diasporic and Indigenous ethno-social groups.
There is an urgent need for greater academic engagement with these practices and the creation of a legal framework to support the incorporation of traditional complementary health practices into services offered by the SUS.

Fragmented, organ-specific models tend to suppress symptoms rather than resolve root causes or restore whole-system regulation.
Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), by contrast, embraces a holistic, person-centered framework that interprets symptoms as signs of systemic imbalance. Integrating biomedicine's strengths with TCM’s systems-based understanding enables a more comprehensive, sustainable approach—prioritizing prevention, self-care, and non-pharmacological therapies.
Founded in 1993 by Dr. Ka-Kit Hui, the UCLA Center for East-West Medicine (the Center) institutionalized this integrative model within UCLA Health, one of the top academic medical centers in the United States. Its mission is to provide safe, effective, affordable, and accessible care to address persistent gaps in modern healthcare with the East-West model.
Inspired by TCM masters and integrative medicine pioneers in China, Dr. Hui’s vision of building this model has shaped his whole career development at UCLA. He launched the Center’s clinical and educational programs through external grants and part-time staff, despite not having a dedicated facility and institutional financial support.
Today, all clinical faculty are fellowship-trained at the Center with many are even former students and residents of the Center's education programs.";"1. Institutional and Regulatory Barriers
 In the early 1990s, integrative medicine—including TCM—was widely regarded as quackery within academic health centers. Acupuncture, in particular, faced regulatory ambiguity and skepticism. To address this, Dr. Hui strategically began with the more widely accepted application of acupuncture for chronic pain management, an area where biomedicine was not as effective in managing.
By combining acupuncture with trigger point injections, Dr. Hui introduced a practical and legally defensible approach. Guided by TCM theory, trigger point techniques were used to treat myofascial dysfunction due to the overlap in location of many acupuncture points and trigger points. This allowed physicians to bill insurance for trigger point services even when acupuncture coverage was limited. This approach quickly gained support from referring providers and university administrators.
2. Workforce Development
 At the time, few US biomedically-trained practitioners were familiar with both Eastern and Western medical paradigms. To fill this gap, the Center initially brought in experienced clinicians from China and simultaneously developed interdisciplinary training programs. These early investments laid the groundwork for a mission-aligned team and ensured the long-term sustainability of the East-West model.
The success of the Center’s clinical program is closely tied to its educational pipeline. The faculty and many of its referring physicians are former trainees who continue to carry the Center’s integrative vision forward within the UCLA system.";"East-West Model Outcomes
The Center demonstrates how a person-centered, integrative model can thrive within an academic health system. Its clinical program includes integrative consultations, East-West primary care, and specialty services across four outpatient clinics and two hospital-based sites. A multidisciplinary team—including 22 clinical faculty, 10 acupuncturists, and support staff—manages nearly 40,000 patient visits annually.
The Center receives over 500 annual referrals from UCLA Health, often for complex or refractory conditions. Many referring physicians and their families eventually become patients themselves—reflecting trust in the model’s value. Most patients are non-Asian and receive personalized, multimodal care plans grounded in whole-person evaluations. The model integrates non-pharmacological therapies (e.g., acupuncture-like stimulation, manual therapy, mind-body practices) with preventive care, education, as well as constitution-based lifestyle and dietary guidance. It has shown effectiveness in treating cancer-related symptoms, ENT disorders, mental health conditions, allergies, immune dysfunction, and long-COVID. Research confirms its safety, efficacy, and cost-efficiency.
Educational Innovation and Community Engagement
Education has been central to the Center’s mission. Programs include medical school electives, residency rotations, a formal fellowship, and continuing education, cultivating a network of integrative-minded clinicians within UCLA Health.
Public and patient education are equally important. The Center produces multilingual self-care materials and hosts community workshops to promote health literacy. A key partnership with the Chinatown Service Center has expanded access to underserved populations through culturally responsive, community-based clinics that also function as training and research sites focused on Asian American health disparities.
Lessons and Key Strategies for Success
The Center’s success in implementing and sustaining the East-West integrative model within a major biomedical institution stems from several strategically aligned factors. First, the model is clinically effective, addressing persistent challenges like chronic pain through therapies grounded in both TCM and biomedicine. Second, it is scientifically validated, with growing evidence supporting the mechanisms and efficacy of interventions such as acupuncture and trigger point therapy.
Third, the Center ensured legal alignment by framing overlapping practices like acupuncture and trigger point therapy within accepted biomedical language, allowing their implementation under conventional regulatory frameworks while guided by TCM theory—minimizing risk and enhancing legitimacy. Fourth, the model is financially sustainable through the use of reimbursable therapies, supporting clinic operations and improving access. Finally, it has gained social acceptance through demonstrated outcomes and peer-reviewed research, earning trust from both the public and the medical community.
Together, these interlocking strategies enabled the Center to institutionalize an integrative, culturally informed model that is scientifically credible, operationally viable, and adaptable across diverse healthcare settings.";"The Center’s three-decade journey illustrates how a thoughtful, patient-centered integrative model can not only coexist with but thrive within a dominant biomedical system. By emphasizing prevention, self-care, and non-pharmacological therapies, the Center has demonstrated that traditional and modern medical systems can be harmonized to address today’s pressing health challenges. 
While significant progress has been made at UCLA, access to integrative services remains limited, and continued efforts are needed to expand reach and equity. The Center’s evolving experience provides practical insights and a replicable blueprint for healthcare systems worldwide seeking to implement holistic, sustainable, and culturally responsive care. We hope these efforts will contribute to the global movement toward person-centered, integrative health strategies that prioritize wellness, equity, and long-term system resilience. The Center’s model of integrative primary care, as discussed in another abstract regarding the Center’s collaboration with the Shanghai branch of the Chinese Association of Integrative Medicine, offers a compelling and scalable framework for healthcare transformation.";"Integrative Medicine; person-centered care; health systems; Implementation"

This initiative is the result of a partnership between the Florianópolis School of Public Health, part of the city’s municipal administration, and the Sagres Association. Through this partnership, supervised interns from the Teaching and Social Outpatient Clinic of the Sagres School of Anthroposophic Artistic Therapy provide care to patients referred by the CSFRT health team. The project also receives essential financial support from the Mahle Institute, which enables the purchase of materials and provides scholarships for Sagres participants, making this important social initiative possible.

For over 20 years, the Teaching and Social Outpatient Clinic in Anthroposophic Artistic Therapy (ADSTAAS) has offered therapeutic care focused on patients’ well-being, intern training, and research. The clinic supports the Sagres School and contributes to public health through the National Policy on Integrative and Complementary Health Practices (PNPICS), expanding access to anthroposophic therapies within Brazil’s public healthcare system (SUS).";Implement the Anthroposophic Artistic Therapy in Primary Health Care in Florianópolis/SC - Brazil;"The most experienced interns, supervised by a coordinator, form the therapeutic team. The team works closely with the CSFRT health staff, including referrals from physicians and other professionals.

Therapy sessions are held on Fridays, with two group options available:

Group 1: 8:00 AM to 9:15 AM

Group 2: 9:45 AM to 11:00 AM

Each group consists of up to four patients, but the treatment is individualized—each patient follows a personal therapeutic path, even within a group setting.

The therapy begins with free artistic expression, allowing patients to engage in creative activities. These artworks, together with the anamnesis and clinical observations, help the therapists build an initial diagnostic image, which then guides the therapeutic plan. Artistic techniques—such as drawing, painting, and modeling—are used to observe and influence health conditions, in accordance with the principles of Anthroposophic Medicine.

During the process, patients begin to connect with their inner life forces, feelings, and thoughts, engaging with life’s challenges—such as illness or personal difficulties—through artistic expression. With the guidance of the intern therapist, patients are encouraged to respond to these challenges creatively. Over time, they develop the ability to use their formative forces more consciously and purposefully, aligning their actions with their individual essence and life purpose.

Therapeutic tasks are tailored to each patient’s needs, seeking to harmonize the human being’s inner constituents. As the artistic process evolves, improvements in the initial complaints are observed, and new therapeutic goals may emerge. The highest of these is to support the patient’s journey of self-discovery and self-healing, fostering personal development that benefits both the individual and the community.

To support this process, patients are asked to rate their level of discomfort or difficulty using a subjective scale at the beginning of therapy. This is reassessed throughout the treatment, including at the point of discharge.

The project employs a methodology based on the seven life processes, developed by therapist Mariane Altmaier. The evolution of the therapy is continuously monitored, considering the processual forces present in artistic expression, the patient’s intentions, and the therapist’s perceptions. Evaluations are conducted at two levels:

Weekly, between supervisor and interns

Monthly, among the supervisor, clinic coordinator, and project manager

This ongoing process of observation, evaluation, and guidance ensures that the therapy remains aligned with each patient’s individual healing journey and therapeutic goals.";"Strengthen intersectoral and institutional coordination to ensure the sustainability of the project.
Given the positive impact observed in the comprehensive care of patients and in the training of interns, it is recommended to consolidate and expand the integration among the various stakeholders involved — the Municipal Health Department, the Sagres Association, the Mahle Institute, and the Primary Health Care teams. This includes ensuring ongoing funding, continuous training for the teams, and the expansion of services to other units within the primary care network, thus promoting equity in access to Integrative and Complementary Health Practices.";"Complementary Therapies; Unified Health System; Intersectoral Collaboration; Anthroposophy; art therapy"

CEWM has established a person-centered integrative East-West model of care with an emphasis on wellness promotion, disease prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation within UCLA Health. With this model, CEWM provides comprehensive clinical services, including consultative care, primary care and inpatient consultative care. In addition to serving close to 40,000 patient visits annually through our four clinics and inpatient consult service, our contribution to the UCLA Health System also includes training clinicians in non-pharmacological and integrative medicine approaches as the first line of care in serving multiethnic patient populations. Since 1995, CEWM has been providing a comprehensive portfolio of integrative medicine courses and conferences for undergraduate students, medicine students, residents, and fellows, practicing physicians (including those from other specialties), as well as other health care providers. 
Seeing success at UCLA, CEWM has begun to apply implementation science to extend its reach into underserved communities. Since April 2021, CEWM has partnered with Chinatown Service Center (CSC), one of the largest Asian American organizations in Southern California. CSC provides a range of comprehensive services that include Social Services, Behavioral Health, Medical Services, and a Youth Center, generating 195,000 visits annually. As a successful federally qualified health center (FQHC) for more than 15 years, CSC Health serves more than 35,000 individuals annually with its demographics encompassing ~75% ethnic Chinese and ~20% Hispanic /Latino patients. Our collaboration goals are to: (1) make integrative medicine services available and accessible for its patients and clients, (2) make CSC as a medical education platform for cultural competency on Asian Americans, and (3) establish a research site for health disparities faced by underserved Chinese/Asian and Latinx immigrants. 
Below is an experience report showcasing both near- and long-term highlights of the ongoing collaboration. 
";"While the CEWM-CSC partnership has made considerable progress, several challenges remain. Chief among them is the lack of sustainable funding and salary support for non-clinical academic contributions such as teaching, curriculum development, program coordination, and community-engaged research. Despite growing demand, limited resources constrain the ability to scale innovations, evaluate impact rigorously, and retain a stable interdisciplinary workforce.

Additionally, political and structural uncertainties in the healthcare and public funding landscape present ongoing risks to long-term planning. However, the integration of academic medicine with community-based service delivery provides a resilient platform for advancing 
";"Medical Education:
The partnership has enabled the integration of culturally responsive integrative medicine training across the UCLA David Geffen School of Medicine. Key initiatives include:
•	Early Authentic Clinical Experience (EACE, 2022–2024): A 10-month community health immersion for first-year medical students, exposing them to integrative primary care in a resource-limited FQHC serving Asian and Latinx populations. 
•	Discovery Area of Concentration (2023–present): A 9-month immersion for third-year medical students combining clinical rotations, health disparities research, and culturally sensitive program development in Asian American communities.
•	Fellowship Training and Electives (2025–present): CEWM fellows and visiting trainees now rotate through the CSC integrative medicine teaching clinic to build competencies in community-based, culturally informed care.
These programs not only enhance the cultural competence of future clinicians but also build a pipeline of practitioners trained to work effectively in underserved and immigrant communities.
Clinical Services:
Since fall 2024, UCLA Department of Medicine and CSC have established a joint clinical service agreement enabling UCLA clinicians to provide care within CSC’s primary care infrastructure. Major accomplishments include:
•	Integrative Medicine Teaching Clinic: Launched in 2022, the clinic now delivers 300 visits per month using CEWM’s consultative and treatment protocols adapted to the community setting. Staffed by three integrative physicians and two licensed acupuncturists, it integrates TCM into chronic disease and functional care pathways. There are plans to further integrate East-West Medicine into CSC’s new Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE).
•	Behavioral Health Integration: Joint grants have supported the delivery of culturally congruent, non-drug mental health services, including a music therapy program for common mental disorders. Future collaborations will involve UCLA’s Center of Excellence in Maternal and Child Health to expand family- and child-centered mental health services and programming.
•	Dental-Oral Health Innovation: In partnership with the UCLA School of Dentistry, a CSC dentist completed advanced training in dental acupuncture and now leads East-West oral medicine integration at CSC. With completion of a Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) Teaching Health Center planning grant, plans are underway to launch a general dentistry residency with an emphasis on integrative oral health.
Community Programs and Public Health Education:
Beyond clinical and educational work, the partnership has developed community-facing initiatives to promote self-care and mental wellness in accessible, culturally tailored formats:
•	EWM Self-Care Video Series: Developed in collaboration with the LA County Department of Public Health, this 27-video series introduces evidence-based East-West practices—including Tai Chi, acupressure, and mindfulness—for chronic pain and mental health. Videos will soon be subtitled or narrated in Chinese to serve CSC’s patient population.
•	Cyrus Tang Scholars Program: This initiative trains early-career health professionals to co-design and pilot culturally sensitive non-drug mental health interventions in partnership with CSC.
•	“Healing with the Senses” Festival (May 2026): Celebrating both Mental Health Awareness Month and AAPI Heritage Month, this festival will engage community members in interactive workshops based on the six senses—sight, sound, touch, taste, smell, and spirit. Activities will include intergenerational storytelling, hands-on wellness demonstrations, and on-site mental health screenings, targeting a turnout of over 1,000 participants.
";The CEWM-CSC partnership represents a dynamic and evolving model of academic-community collaboration in integrative medicine. Rooted in shared values of cultural humility, equity, and person-centered care, the partnership bridges the gap between academic innovation and community need. Its impact extends across clinical services, workforce training, community health promotion, and mental health equity.

The Municipal Health Plan (2022-2025) provided for the offering of an Auriculotherapy Training Course, addressing the need to expand the offering of Integrative and Complementary Health Practices (PICS), aiming to reduce medicalization, strengthen knowledge of traditional Chinese medicine in primary health care, and raise awareness of unconventional therapeutic practices for improving quality of life and well-being.
The planning and development of the course project began in May 2024, after the release of an acupuncture specialist from the São Pedro Municipal Emergency Room, who joined the PICS Technical Area team of the Vitória Municipal Health Department (SEMU). The participation of the ETSUS teaching team was essential to developing the course, following the methodology based on the Continuing Health Education Policy, as well as partnering with the course development, monitoring, and evaluation.
Objectives: Understand the main concepts and foundations of Auriculotherapy and its applicability in comprehensive health care, the anatomical structures of the ear, auricular points, and their respective body areas; the main methods of diagnosis and treatment with Auriculotherapy; Identify the most prevalent diseases in primary health care that can be treated with Auriculotherapy; the application techniques of Auriculotherapy, with an emphasis on seed application; and Apply Auriculotherapy with seeds. Target audience: Healthcare workers with a higher education degree who work in Primary Health Care and specialized services within the SEMUS Vitória network, mostly permanent employees, who have not participated in other Auriculotherapy courses in the last four years.
Categories/areas: Physical Education, Nursing, Pharmacy, Physiotherapy, Speech-Language Pathology, Medicine, Nutrition, Psychology, Dentistry, Occupational Therapy, and Residents. The curriculum was developed and organized alongside the production of theoretical materials, quizzes, discussion forums, and presentations of intervention projects. Videos and articles available in the virtual learning environment (VLE) were selected, along with practical activities and invitations to expert facilitators. Places were made available, specifying the number of places per service, given the higher-than-expected demand. The course ran from October to December 2024, with a blended learning schedule of 60 hours, divided into 24 hours of in-person and synchronous remote classes and 36 hours of content and activities in the VLE.he content covered theoretical foundations, auricular maps, clinical case discussions, application techniques, auriculotherapy practice with seeds, theoretical and practical assessments, and the development of service intervention projects. These projects were developed by participants (individually or in groups) and analyzed by the PICS technical team and pedagogical coordinators.

Recent diagnostic criteria for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) have included sensory sensitivities as a core diagnostic feature due to difficulties in social integration. Since the five senses capture stimuli and decode them into electromagnetic impulses, could atypical sensory experiences exhibit an easily observable electromagnetic pattern? How could we measure it? (Robertson, 2017)
With the need for an automated method to support early diagnosis of ASD recognized by regulatory bodies, the electromagnetic measurement technologies Bioelectrography and Ryodoraku, which use Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) reasoning as bioenergetic markers, become current and relevant in our society, as the literature reveals their potential to provide diagnostic and screening tools in medical biometrics. (Lo, 2012; Sankhala, 2020; Kostyuk, 2010; Kostyuk, 2011; Korotkov, 2019; Certificate No.: 250817, 2024).
Using these two biophysical technologies in a double-verification system, this study monitored and analyzed the electromagnetic behavioral pattern of ASD in order to understand its context and processes, making its key elements evident.

DESCRIPTION
An empirical data collection experiment was carried out using the Ryodoraku and Bioelectrography (Bio-Well) methods on 7 autistic patients.

The Ryodoraku method, recognized by ANVISA (Brazilian Health Regulatory Agency), uses an electro-conductivity measurement system performed quickly and non-invasively, with the simple touch of a probe to 24 acupuncture points located on the hands and feet. (Volpi, 2018; Lobo, 2021; Imamura, 1996; ANVISA, Registration 80191680005)

The Bioelectrography (Bio-Well) method, certified by the European Community, uses a high-intensity electric field to stimulate the emission of photons and electrons at acupuncture points located on the 10 fingers, making the measurement process very similar to a quick and non-invasive fingerprint scan. (Korotkov, 2019)

A total of two measurements were taken—one with the Bioelectrography (Bio-Well) method and one with the Ryodoraku method. Both are fast (each lasting about 5 minutes), non-invasive, and pose no risk to the patient.";Recent diagnostic criteria for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) have included sensory sensitivities as a core diagnostic feature due to difficulties in social integration. Since the five senses capture stimuli and decode them into electromagnetic impulses, could atypical sensory experiences exhibit an easily observable electromagnetic pattern? How could we measure it?;"The empirical experience with 7 autistic patients revealed, through comparison with neurotypical subjects, a clear discrepancy in the Bio-Well ""stress level"" marker. All 7 autistic patients showed high Bio-Well stress levels, while the neurotypical parents presented only slightly elevated Bio-Well stress levels. This marker deserves special attention, as literature reveals increasing awareness that oxidative stress may be involved in the pathophysiology of ASD.

Blood is one of the main substrates for electron current and when functioning normally, the ""electron clouds"" are evenly distributed. In cases of imbalanced blood circulation, electron transfer to tissue is impaired and free radical reactions do not flow harmoniously. Therefore, the lack of brightness in the EPI-gram (Electrophotonic Image) is an indicator of hindered electron density transfer to body tissues and abnormal flow of free radical reactions. 

The Ryodoraku method revealed a widely reported syndromic pattern in the literature of excess Liver and inhibited Heart in all 7 assessed patients. According to TCM, autism-related signs and symptoms—such as anger, rage, frustration, depression and resentment, chaotic and/or manic behavior, muscle cramps, tendon contractions, limited extension/flexion of tendons, blurred vision, tremors, and seizures—can be alleviated or controlled when Liver energy is rebalanced.";"The insights from empirical observation pointed to a need for further investigation and motivated the development of a project relevant to my master’s academic experience, aligned with research, aimed at refining methods for data collection that may contribute to the production of scientific materials on the topic.

 DESCRIPTION: The World Health Organization recommends multidisciplinary care, as well as the use of Integrative and Complementary Practices (ICPs), in the entire pregnancy-puerperal cycle, including labor (PT), benefiting more positive outcomes ¹. 
The Brazilian National Policy for Integrative and Complementary Practices (PNPIC) aims to implement PICS in the Unified Health System (SUS), generate adherence and monitor their use in services², at the three levels of care, including maternity hospitals and obstetric centers, for habitual and high-risk pregnant women, implemented by multiprofessional teams, and qualified to use them. The use of ICT during labor, especially Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), considering auriculotherapy and acupressure, makes the birth experience more humanized, respecting the woman's protagonism, and breaks with the traditional centered medical model, providing an integral view³. 
The PNPIC encourages the production of scientific evidence, training and professional qualification, in partnership with Health Higher Education Institutions (HEIs)², which form a support network for the SUS, developing extension projects, integrating teaching, care and research ?.
Considering the above, an extension project was implemented in a municipal public maternity hospital in Rio de Janeiro, by a physiotherapist professor in women's health and undergraduate students in physiotherapy from a federal HEI in Rio de Janeiro, all with training in PICS, aiming to integrate multiprofessional care for parturients during labor. The maternity hospital attends to habitual and high-risk pregnant women, and has only a few non-pharmacological analgesic strategies, often consisting of free movements and sprinkler baths, as desired by the parturient. The physiotherapeutic prescription, on the other hand, is based on the baby's height in the pelvis, dilation, labor time, degree of pain, fatigue and feelings of the parturient, considering the use of resources such as: sprinkler bath, movements and adoption of postures aligned with biomechanics, therapeutic ball and peanuts, transcutaneous electrostimulation, diaphragmatic breathing, emotional and humanized support, auriculotherapy, acupressure and reflexotherapy. However, in this experience report, movement and positioning, breathing and TCM were used exclusively. TCM was used in 8 parturients aged between 22 and 39 years, 6 primiparous and 2 multiparous, with between 5 and 6 cm of uterine dilation. All of them had a baby positioned in the upper narrows of the pelvis, all reported grade 10 of pain (measured by the visual analog pain scale/VAS), all self-reported extreme fatigue, and said that they would not be able to reach the end of the delivery, requesting a cesarean section. Breathing, positions and movements guided by a physiotherapist were offered, combined with the use of acupoints in the sacroiliac for pain and also to assist in the induction of uterine contraction (BL31 and BL32). Regarding auriculotherapy, common points were used, such as: Shen men, Uterus, Cervix, Hypothalamus, Pituitary, Kidney, Liver and Neurasthenia, as well as points according to individual needs?.
";To increase the quality of multidisciplinary care for parturients, providing strategies that favor progressive uterine contractions and descent of the baby during delivery, as well as the control of pain and fatigue and reduction of negative emotions, such as anxiety and fear. The combination of negative factors can increase the cycle of pain and muscle tension, with repercussions on the extension of labor time, leading to outcomes such as cesarean section ?.;Considering the time elapsed from the beginning of care to the expulsive period, among 5 primiparous women, there was a variation between 3 and 4 hours, and among multiparous women, a variation between 1 hour and 3 hours. In all of them, there was a report of reduced pain, fatigue and anxiety, as well as improved self-confidence to reach the expulsive moment, in addition to the report of satisfaction. It was perceived that the use of TCM, combined with movements and positions, from the physiotherapist's perspective, favored the establishment of rhythm in regular and progressive uterine contractions, as well as reassured the parturients. Among primiparous women, there was one in which the beginning of care occurred late, with more than 18 hours of labor, difficulties in establishing rhythmic contractions, and extreme fatigue, pain, and anxiety. During the consultation, dilation progressed up to 9 cm, with rhythmic contractions. However, due to the end of the shift, the team had to leave, ceasing the physiotherapeutic exercises, with a stop in progression and evolution to cesarean section.     ;To humanize and qualify multiprofessional care for parturients, reducing unnecessary interventions and cesarean sections, in addition to maternal mortality, through the use of light, low-cost, easy-to-apply technologies, and results already evident in the literature. For this, it is relevant to improve professional training and qualification, which will reflect on care practices and maternal outcomes. In this sense, health education and care practice should consider strategies to obtain better obstetric results, such as multiprofessional care, including physical therapists, and the use of light and woman-centered technologies, such as TCM. ;"childbirth assistance; Physiotherapy; Auriculotherapy; acupressure"

It is 879 km from the capital, Manaus, and belongs to the Upper Solimões Microregion and Southwest Amazon Mesoregion. Santo Antônio do Iça has an area of 12,366.14 km², a population of 28,211, and a population density of 2.28 inhabitants/km², according to the latest demographic census (IBGE, 2022).
The Human Development Index (HDI) of the municipality of Santo Antônio do Içá is low (0.533), meaning the municipality has lower life expectancy, income, and access to education and healthcare compared to other municipalities in Brazil, particularly Manaus, which has a high HDI. Another important index for analyzing the municipality is the Social Progress Index (SPI), which assesses the population's quality of life. On a scale of 0 to 100, the SPI encompasses dimensions of human needs, the foundations of well-being, and opportunities. The municipality's 2025 SPI is 50.34, or average.
The health system of the municipality is part of the Health Region Alto Solimões. According to the National Register of Health Establishments (CNES) of the municipality, the Municipal Health System is composed of 15 health facilities, all belonging to primary care and some emergencies, with more severe cases being referred to Manaus or larger cities in the region.
This study presented the health territory of one of these facilities, the Santo Antônio do Içá Health Center – located in the downtown neighborhood of Santo Antônio do Içá. The health territory in question is served by the ""Beija Flor"" Family Health Team, responsible for serving 2,584 active citizens. The student in question is the physician at the Beija Flor Family Health Strategy (ESF). In addition to the physician in charge, the team includes thirteen professionals, primarily Community Health Agents (CHAs), totaling fourteen professionals, as well as nursing technicians and nurses.
";"In general, the daily work of this team is disjointed and, above all, lacking strategic planning. This lack of planning is primarily due to the lack of data on the health territory to develop strategies for health actions, in addition to the disuse of existing resources for this purpose. To clarify this context, we highlight the situation of children within the territory covered by the Beija Flor Family Health Strategy (ESF). In this case, it is unknown how many children were born in the last month and, consequently, there is no planning for developing a schedule for monitoring childcare and postpartum care. Therefore, Community Health Agents (CHAs) are not directed to collect data, and when they do provide it, it is not used. The consequences of this situation are catastrophic, given its impact on patient records—which are mostly incomplete, lacking patient address and contact information—and, most importantly, on primary care planning in the health territory covered by the Beija Flor Family Health Strategy (ESF).
The lack of reliable monitoring of indicators, especially for riverside and Indigenous communities, results in health inequities, such as acute cases of gastroenteritis, flu-like illnesses, and other infectious diseases. In addition to these morbidities, the community suffers from chronic diseases such as hypertension and rheumatological syndromes, especially lumbosciatic pain, which in many cases are not monitored by the team, lacking intelligent, interdisciplinary strategies to address the issues at hand.";"
";"This experience report recommends developing a visit calendar based on mapping the micro-areas covered by Community Health Agents (CHAs). This mapping is essential to provide visibility to populations that are not yet adequately monitored in health territories, especially those located in the  region. Developing a well-structured calendar can significantly contribute to preventing preventable morbidities and deaths, strengthening Primary Care indicators in the municipality of Santo Antônio do Içá.
Despite the relevance of this proposal, its implementation faces significant challenges, primarily related to logistics, the availability of technological equipment, and the lack of qualified human resources to effectively map and operationalize the calendar. Even so, overcoming these obstacles is essential to ensuring greater equity in access to  services and strengthening the Family Health Strategy's role in vulnerable areas.";"experience; ; Healthcare professionals; Amazon"

The island is vulnerable to the environmental impacts of industrialization, especially air pollution, rising temperatures, and increasing frequency of heat waves, which exacerbate pre-existing health challenges. The local population faces significant socioeconomic inequalities and limited access to healthcare services. These vulnerabilities make the community an ideal context for the implementation of an interdisciplinary planetary health approach.
The initiative was developed by medical students through a partnership between the PlanetAR Project and the local community. Over a three-day period, students interacted with residents, local workers, and healthcare professionals, immersing themselves in the daily realities of life on the island. The educational model involved various stakeholders, including public school students and healthcare professionals. Workshops were held to educate participants on the health impacts of air pollution and heat waves, while also discussing solutions and adaptation strategies in a practical context.
Methods
The educational strategy employed a combination of workshops aimed at different segments of the community: school students and healthcare professionals. These workshops were tailored to the specific needs and understanding levels of each group.
1. Workshops with School Students: The sessions were designed to be interactive and engaging, using playful and visual materials to help young students understand the link between climate change and health. Topics such as air pollution and heat waves were presented through games, drawings, and role-playing activities, allowing students to express their concerns and ideas creatively. These workshops fostered awareness and promoted a sense of empowerment among students to advocate for environmental and health improvements in their community.
2. Workshops with Healthcare Professionals: The sessions for healthcare workers focused on the practical impacts of air pollution and heat waves on health. Students worked alongside professionals to discuss the specific challenges of managing patients during extreme heat events. Topics included adjusting medication doses during heatwaves, managing dehydration, and the use of protective equipment for vulnerable patients. These workshops aimed to enhance the capacity of local healthcare providers to respond to climate-related health emergencies.
3. Community Involvement: One of the core elements of this experience was the integration of the community throughout the process. Residents were encouraged to participate in the workshops, share their personal experiences, and provide valuable insights into how local healthcare systems could be better prepared for climate-related health risks. This helped students see the practical application of their knowledge in a real-world context and fostered a sense of shared responsibility.";"The primary issues addressed by the students were the health risks posed by air pollution, heat waves, and other climate-related phenomena that disproportionately affect marginalized communities, such as those living on Ilha de Maré. These issues are compounded by the area's industrial activities, inadequate access to health services, and a lack of awareness among residents about how climate change impacts health.

1. Air Pollution: The community is exposed to high levels of air pollution due to nearby industrial activities, which contribute to respiratory diseases and other health problems.
2. Heat Waves: The increasing frequency of heatwaves exacerbates cardiovascular and respiratory conditions, particularly among vulnerable populations such as the elderly, children, and people with pre-existing health conditions.
3. Climate Change: The broader impacts of climate change, including sea level rise and extreme weather events, further threaten the health and livelihoods of residents on the island. The medical students’ role was to raise awareness about these issues, create spaces for dialogue, and propose practical solutions, particularly in the context of healthcare adaptations to mitigate the health impacts of climate change.";"The workshops had a significant impact on the local community and medical students alike. Some of the key outcomes included:
1. Enhanced Awareness: There was a notable increase in awareness among school students and healthcare professionals about the health risks posed by air pollution and heat waves. Students were able to articulate the relationship between these environmental factors and specific health conditions such as asthma, respiratory infections, and heatstroke.
2. Development of Mitigation Strategies: Medical students presented strategies to reduce health risks associated with climate change, including recommendations for public health policies, community-based adaptations, and individual protective measures.
3. Knowledge Exchange: The workshops provided an opportunity for knowledge exchange between students and local healthcare professionals. This collaboration enhanced the capacity of healthcare workers to handle climate-related health challenges, such as adjusting medication doses for patients during heatwaves.
4. Empowered Local Community: Residents expressed increased confidence in managing their health in the face of environmental challenges, and many indicated a desire to continue participating in climate-related health initiatives.";"Based on the experience of this immersive educational project, several recommendations were made for both future medical education and community engagement in climate health:
1. Integrating Planetary Health into Medical Education: It is essential to integrate planetary health principles into medical curricula, enabling students to develop a comprehensive understanding of the complex relationships between human health, the environment, and climate change.
2. Strengthening Community Involvement: Future projects should continue to prioritize community engagement, ensuring that local residents are not only recipients of information but active participants in identifying and implementing solutions.
3. Expanding Educational Approaches: The combination of theoretical and practical workshops is effective, but future initiatives could benefit from expanding into other areas of healthcare, such as mental health impacts of climate change, waterborne diseases, and vector-borne diseases related to climate shifts.
4. Policy Advocacy: Medical students and healthcare professionals should be encouraged to advocate for public policies that address climate change as a determinant of health. This could include better regulation of pollution, improving healthcare infrastructure to handle climate-related emergencies, and promoting health equity.
This report summarizes the practical and educational efforts undertaken by medical students to address climate change impacts on health in a Quilombola community in Brazil. The outcomes highlighted the importance of community-based learning and interdisciplinary education in addressing the global challenge of climate change.";"climate change; health equity; Medical education; Community Engagement"

Based on health promotion, disease prevention, and education for self-care, it utilizes integrative and complementary practices (PICS), therapeutic dynamics, interactive process, and group processes, encouraging individual empowerment and autonomy. The health hebiatric care is based on the naturopathy ethics manual, on the guidelines of the adolescent health program, aligned with the peinciples of the adolescent statute (ECA). Since 2006, Naturology has been part of the Adolescent Health Program (PROSAD), and since October 2024, the Naturology Unit has become part of its team. PROSAD is a public policy initiative of the state of São Paulo, internationally recognized, that offers comprehensive and transdisciplinary care to young people aged 10 to 20. Coordinated by Dr. Albertina Duarte Takiuti, the program includes 21 units (Adolescent Houses), four of which have naturologists on staff, reaffirming the role of Naturology as a driver of social transformation and promoter of equity in youth care.;"The Naturology Unit voluntarily integrates multidisciplinary teams within the program, conducting activities in waiting rooms such as discussion circles on integrative health, art therapy dynamics, collective efforts to grow medicinal gardens at the Adolescent Houses, cultural and health events like open mic sessions (Sarau), and both individual and group consultations—all grounded in naturological principles. Each space experiences its own uniqueness and challenges in welcoming young people. Although the Houses operate in different contexts, they are all centered on adolescence and the specificities of the many processes they embrace. The Naturology Unit’s work at the Women’s Outpatient Clinic of the Clinical Hospital (HC) and at the Pinheiros Adolescent House integrates knowledge of natural gynecology and obstetrics into the multidisciplinary teams focused on gynecology and women’s health. In Pinheiros, the team also offers individual consultations in adolescent naturology, self-care workshops, and health dialogue circles in the waiting areas. The M’Boi Mirim Adolescent House offers socio-educational activities to the community, including individual consultations, health education circles, and art therapy dynamics. The Taboão da Serra Adolescent House provides consultations and workshops aimed at health promotion. Within Brazil’s Unified Health System (SUS), the activities developed by the Naturology Unit contribute to the incorporation of integrative practices into public health frameworks, fostering empowerment and autonomy among adolescents, naturologists, and multiprofessional teams in adolescent healthcare.
";Over the years, an average of 2,710 individual sessions and 722 group sessions were conducted. Both adolescents and professionals observed improvements in self-awareness, emotional and social perception, strengthened autonomy, and emotional intelligence. There was also a significant increase in engagement in self-care activities, conflict resolution, and group integration. The adolescents were successfully welcomed and supported, and the professionals contributed to reducing the impact of risk factors on their health;"The initially proposed objectives were achieved, with emphasis on strengthening adolescents’ autonomy, self-care, and social integration. Naturological practices demonstrated a positive impact on emotional and relational aspects, validating the proposal of person-centered integral care. It is recommended to continue and expand the actions developed, with emphasis on individual consultations, self-care workshops, dialogue circles, and group-based integrative practices. Interprofessional collaboration and active listening should remain essential foundations of the approach. Practical suggestions could be expand team training in Integrative and Complementary Health Practices (PICS); foster intersectoral partnerships; and implement continuous evaluation tools focused on the subjective impacts of the interventions. Finally, it is suggested to replicate the experience in other regions, develop specific clinical protocols for naturological care in adolescence, and encourage scientific research on the effects of these practices within the context of public health.";"Integrative Health; Naturology; Health Promotion and Education in the Unified Health System (SUS); Adolescent Health Program; "

Therefore, the demands of this population are multidimensional, requiring a holistic approach from professionals providing care. The literature points to the positive effects of Integrative Health Practices (IHPs) on health conditions frequently identified among people with wounds, such as pain, mood changes, and sleep patterns. In Brazil, auriculotherapy stands out among the IHPs included in the National Policy for Integrative and Complementary Practices (PNPIC) due to the greater scope of training programs and consequent greater availability within the Unified Health System (SUS). Nurses and nursing technicians, in turn, are the professional categories that most frequently care for people with wounds and their significant representation among auriculotherapists in SUS health services. Although ISPs are developed within a multidisciplinary setting, it is worth noting that, in Brazil, Nursing recognizes them as a practice that comprises its scope of practice, regulating them with corresponding training requirements (COFEN Resolution No. 739, February 5, 2024; MILDEMBERG et al. 2023). Therefore, educational institutions represent an important mediator in the process of transferring knowledge to evidence-based clinical practice. Thus, this study aimed to report the contributions of the Center for Chinese Medicine of the Confucius Institute of the Federal University of Goiás (UFG), linked to the Outpatient Clinic for Integrative Health Practices (PIS) of the School of Nursing (FEN) of the same institution. This program maintains, as an outreach activity, a training program for auriculotherapists. This program, exceptionally, addressed lato sensu graduate students in Dermatological Nursing with an Emphasis on Care for People with Wounds.";The development of technical-scientific productions, when combined with experiential activities on the topic, is considered relevant to bridge gaps between theoretical aspects and clinical practice. This was possible for the group of graduate students who developed their final project on the effects of auriculotherapy in the therapeutic approach to people with wounds. Regarding professional practice, Resolution No. 736/2024 of the Federal Council of Nursing (COFEN) establishes guidelines for the systematization of care. Meanwhile, the organization of care in PIS (Individual Health Injury Prevention Program) poses a challenge, both to ensure equitable monitoring of individuals, with the production of indicators and respective contributions to the implementation of the PNPIC (National Health Policy), and to provide support for evidence-based clinical practice. Therefore, technical-scientific productions related to care in PIS (Individual Health Injury Prevention Program) are essential and need to be both operational and grounded in appropriate theoretical and philosophical frameworks.;"Concurrently with an integrative literature review, the group of postgraduate students underwent auriculotherapy training at the AmbPIS/Center for Chinese Medicine (TCM\) of the Confucius Institute of UFG, with a workload corresponding to COFEN Resolution No. 739, February 5, 2024. Fundamentals of TCM and the implementation of auriculotherapy comprised one of the modules of the specialization course, and the practical component was carried out in consultations with individuals followed at AmbPIS, under the supervision of one of the therapists with extensive training and integration with the Confucius Institute of UFG. The integrative review followed the recommendations of the PRISMA Statement, using the BVS, MEDLINE-PubMed (National Library of Medicine), CINAHAL, Web of Science, and EMBASE databases. Primary studies in Portuguese, English, and Spanish, with a 10-year time frame, conducted only with humans, and describing interventions among people with wounds were included. Only two studies met the inclusion criteria: a pilot study conducted among women undergoing episiotomy in Croatia and a case study of a man with ulcers due to sickle cell anemia in Campinas, São Paulo, Brazil. The auriculotherapy protocols presented varied across the studies, with the exception of the ""Shen Men"" acupoint. In the study by Jai? et al. (2019), three acupoints were stimulated using semi-permanent needles, while seven were stimulated in the clinical case reported in the study by Benites et al. (2023). In the discussions held based on the literature and clinical practice, the following principles for implementing auriculotherapy among people with wounds are understood (JAIC et al., 2019; BENITES, et al., 2023; CHEN et al., 2025): 1-pay attention to the energy diagnosis that signals Yin and Yang deficiency, Qi and blood stagnation, spleen (earth) and kidney (water) deficiency, especially in cases of people with chronic wounds; 2-verify the relevance of stimulating acupoints that intervene in the autonomic nervous system, which reflect the physiological and psychological repercussions of the individual; 3-perform monitoring using validated scales to assess pain, quality of life, sleep quality, and pruritus; 4-verify the relevance of the therapeutic goals of toning renal and splenic function.";Literature data suggest that auriculotherapy and/or auricular acupuncture should be considered in the care of people with wounds, especially for pain management and its repercussions. These findings represent a starting point for developing clinical auriculotherapy protocols for the population with wounds, a context in which care is still in its infancy. The practical activities carried out at the TCM Center/AmbPIS, aligned with technical and scientific literature on the topic, contributed to the development of technical competencies, especially regarding the emphasis on clinical reasoning based on TCM principles, which distinguishes it from other known auriculotherapy training programs.;"Auriculotherapy; wounds and injuries; Nursing Care; comprehensive health care"

Recent studies in public databases, such as those of the IBGE (Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics) and the WHO's International Agency for Research on Cancer, revealed that in 2012, 26.5% of all cancer cases (114,497 cases) and 33.6% of all cancer deaths in Brazil (63,371 deaths) could have been avoided by changing Brazilians' lifestyles (REZENDE et al, 2017, p. 148). Emerging evidence suggests that part of the link between psychosocial risk factors (stress, anxiety, depression, hostility, lack of emotional support, some personality traits, childhood adversity, and stressful life events) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) and diabetes may operate through the metabolic syndrome, a clustering of several CVD risk factors, including (i) abdominal obesity, (ii) hypertriglyceridemia, (iii) low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, (iv) hypertension, and (v) hyperglycemia.Traditional, Complementary and Integrative Medicine (TCIM) practices are being implemented in private and public health care worldwide. ;This scenario raises the need for digital health solutions that help promote health based on education and empower patients for their self-management and self-care. This experience report refers to the use of a self-assessment and self-monitoring health application offered to patients as a way to complement person-centered care and enable the production of real-world data, in a general practitioner's office in Rio de Janeiro. The online platform and mobile app have been offered to patients since 2019 and already have 787 active users. Its features include assessments, health education, and reminders for treatment adherence. The assessment includes aspects of physical, mental, and behavioral health, using psychometric scales (stress, anxiety, depression, resilience, emotional intelligence, spirituality), lifestyle questionnaires, anthropometric measurements, vital signs, and laboratory tests, as well as diaries of emotions, symptoms, movement, integrative practices such as meditation, yoga, and Tai Chi, nutrition, quality of life, and readiness for change. The tool's integrative approach allows for the creation of a health profile and measurement of the impact of many health interventions. ;As a digital solution, it has been used in the monitoring and follow-up of patients with hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, chronic pain, anxiety, obesity, and other conditions, in Brazil and internationally.;Maintain long-term adherence is a challenge.;"Digital Well-Being; health promotion; Healthcare Access; multidimensional approach in Health; Outpatient telemonitoring clinic"

The proposal was personally presented by the child to INCA and to the Institute’s social action division (Incavoluntário), in a meeting with members of the medical team, nursing staff, occupational therapist, and hospital pedagogues. The initiative was warmly received and approved by the institution, which acknowledged its symbolic and therapeutic relevance. To formalize its continuation, a partnership agreement was established between the child’s legal guardians and Incavoluntário.
The cart is currently in its final stages of production, with a curated selection of books and toys appropriate to the clinical context and to the different stages of child development. The mobile toy and book library will be operated by professionals from the pediatric oncology health and education teams.
The project’s goal is to promote care, bonding, playfulness, comfort, and joy within the hospital environment through play and reading—practices recognized as therapeutic resources by the guidelines of Brazil’s National Policy on Integrative and Complementary Practices in Health (PICS/SUS) and by the World Health Organization’s framework on Traditional, Complementary and Integrative Medicine (TCIM/WHO).";The project operates within the context of pediatric oncology hospitalization, where physical and emotional suffering, pain, and disconnection from everyday life compromise the child's overall well-being. By bringing experiences of affection, playfulness, and attentive listening into the hospital wards, the project helps to ease fears, foster bonds, and support the re-signification of the hospital as a space for coexistence and integral care. It also addresses the ethical and cultural challenge of the invisibilization of the child as an active subject and agent of care. By enabling a child to become the protagonist of a proposal to transform the hospital environment, the project breaks paradigms and proposes a new intergenerational ethic of care.;"Although still in its initial implementation phase, Toys and Books has already generated significant institutional and human impacts. It has strengthened the dialogue between education and health, recognized children’s protagonism as a transformative force, and fostered the creation of a sensitive support network committed to integral care. The young author himself, upon seeing his idea welcomed by adults and transformed into concrete action, expresses feelings of belonging, empathy, and responsibility. Hospital professionals report feeling inspired and hopeful as they witness the project’s development.
The initiative inspires humanized practices, strengthens intergenerational bonds, and transforms the hospital into a symbolic space of citizenship, affection, and creativity.
The continuity of the project will include the active participation of the author and invited guests—both children and adults—who will help shape Toys and Books into a living play-library through ongoing activities that offer affective experiences for hospitalized children, such as meetings with authors, storytelling sessions, creative workshops, and other imaginative encounters.
Paths are already emerging for replication in other institutions and greater involvement of children and schools in collective health actions.";"The experience reveals the transformative potential of intersectoral initiatives in which childhood, education, health, and public policy are innovatively articulated, capable of generating more efficient care networks that are sensitive to the uniqueness of childhood and aligned with the principles of Integrative and Complementary Practices (PICs), the Brazilian Unified Health System (SUS), and Traditional, Complementary and Integrative Medicine (TCIM).
The main challenges include the continuous monitoring of the proposal, qualified mediation by the hospital team, systematic evaluation of its impacts, and the possibility of safe and sensitive replication in other hospital contexts. It is essential to foster an institutional culture that values listening to children as a form of care. Projects like Toys and Books go beyond assistentialism and offer sustainable and civilizing responses for the promotion of comprehensive health. They educate for care, foster citizenship, and inspire a new collective ethic for the future.

Ethical Considerations:
This report results from a project conceived and presented in 2024 by a 10-year-old child, with pedagogical guidance and co-authorship of health and education professionals. The proposal was formally embraced and supervised by the Brazilian National Cancer Institute (INCA) and Incavoluntário, with a partnership agreement signed by the child’s legal guardians. The initiative fully respects national and international ethical principles regarding child protection, agency, and voice, ensuring family consent, confidentiality, and appropriate institutional support throughout all stages of the process.";"Pediatric care; Humanized healthcare environment; Therapeutic play; Child protagonism; Integrative and Complementary Practices"

Traditional medicine (TM) remains a primary source of health care for over 80% of Africa’s population. In 2000, the WHO Regional Office for Africa (WHO/AFRO) launched the first-ever WHO regional strategy on promoting the role of TM in national health systems to advance the TM development in its 47 Member States. This was followed by the 2013 strategy on enhancing the role of TM in health systems. These regional strategies were aligned with the African Union’s (AU) Decades of African Traditional Medicine (2001–2010 and 2011–2020). This abstract presents an assessment of progress, challenges, and lessons learned from 2000 to 2023 across the WHO/AFRO Region.";"(a) Determine the extent of implementation of the priority interventions of the two strategies including plans of actions of the two decades of African TM by the countries in the region;

(c) Identify the challenges encountered in the development, recognition or integration of TM into the national healthcare system of the countries in the African region and 
(d) Identify the next steps in the roadmap to the development, recognition and/or integration of TM into national healthcare systems in the region.
";"Leadership and Governance: By 2023, 40 of the 47 countries had developed national TM policies, up from 8 in 2000. Legal frameworks for TM practice were enacted in 39 countries, compared to only one in 2000. Thirty-two countries established national expert committees on TM to oversee policy and implementation. However, only 28 countries had developed national policy implementation plans demonstrating implementation challenges policy and practice.
Health Workforce and Education: Twenty-five countries integrated TM into the training curricula of health professionals, while 21 included TM in training programmes for TM practitioners. Additional countries need to integrate TM in their curricula and provide continuing education of TM to biomedical professionals to acquire and enhance knowledge on the role of TM in health systems.
Research and Development and Health information System: The number of national TM research institutes grew from 18 in 2000 to 38 in 2023. The COVID-19 pandemic spurred TM research, including clinical trials for herbal medicines proposed for COVID-19 Treatment or prevention in Democratic Republic of Congo, Ghana, Madagascar, Nigeria and South Africa and Uganda. However, preclinical testing and documentation of traditional knowledge remain limited. To systematically collect data on TM and integrate it with other public health priorities it must be included in HIS.
Medical Products and Regulation: National pharmacopoeias and formularies were developed in several countries. Over 100 TM products and 45 for communicable diseases and noncommunicable diseases were registered and included in national essential medicines lists respectively. Nevertheless, fewer than one-third of countries had GMP-compliant production facilities. However, more clinical research as well as appropriate methodologies for TM are required for TM to produce evidence on the safety, efficacy and quality of TM products and interventions.
Health Service Delivery: Several countries established TM clinics within public hospitals, with Ghana having established such facilities in 55 hospitals; though only a limited number achieved full integration of TM into primary health care and insurance coverage.
Health Financing: Most TM programmes remained reliant on external funding, with limited domestic investment. National budget allocations for TM remain inconsistent across the Region. There is need for comprehensive insurance that covers services and products in order to protect populations from financial hardships in line with UHC goals.
Monitoring and Evaluation: WHO/AFRO facilitated periodic assessments through Regional Committee sessions in 2011 (Yamoussoukro), 2016 (Addis Ababa), and 2020 (Brazzaville). However, national M&E frameworks remain weak and data on TM coverage and outcomes is scarce.
";"Regulatory gaps, limited research capacity, underfunding, and uneven integration, inadequate protection of intellectual property—must be addressed. The experience from 2000 to 2023 highlights lessons and emphasize the need to implement the following recommendations:
1.	Stronger political commitment and institutional leadership.
2.	Harmonized regional regulatory frameworks and protection of traditional knowledge.
3.	Investment in R&D, GMP-certified production, and TM infrastructure.
4.	Full integration of TM into health systems under Universal Health Coverage.
5.	Development of robust national M&E frameworks and public engagement strategies.

Introduction:
Taking part in the activities at the HU Backyard Syntropic Community Garden has
been an enriching and transformative experience, both for me and for the others
involved. From the outset, the proposal to grow organic and medicinal food in line
with the principles of syntropic agriculture has created a deep connection with
nature and raised awareness of the importance of sustainable cultivation and
biodiversity.
Objective:
To describe and reflect on the experience of participating in activities with the HU
Backyard syntropic community garden, highlighting impacts on the connection with
nature in health promotion, environmental awareness and strengthening
community bonds, as well as reflecting on practical learning related to sustainable
management and integrative therapeutic actions.
. Method: Experience report on the syntropic community garden in the backyard of
the University Hospital. This report is based on personal observations, learnings
and reflections, focusing on the subjective experience and the therapeutic and
educational aspects experienced. Description of the experience: by getting involved
in the routine of managing the vegetable garden, we were able to understand in
practice the concepts of energetic renewal, and Goethe's and Steiner's
phenomenological protocols for contemplating nature and observing how caring for
the plants promotes a continuous cycle of evolution and balance in the system. We
learn to select seeds from different times of the year, prepare the beds with
seasonal consortium designs and understand the natural rhythms that govern
cultivation. These activities reinforce our understanding of the positive impact of
agroecological food, especially at a time when Brazil is facing increasing food
insecurity. The contact with plants such as medicinal herbs, organic vegetables,
fruit and flowers provided a unique sensory experience. During the activities, we
used contemplation techniques to exercise our senses, such as our sense of smell
as we took in the aroma of the herbs and our sense of sight as we observed the

vibrant colors of the flowers. In addition, the practice of preparing recipes with
ingredients harvested from the garden, especially teas made with medicinal herbs,
brought a therapeutic and welcoming dimension, reinforcing the idea of self-care
and self- Participating in artistic experiences such as singing, seasonal dance circles
and the recording of harvests has helped to strengthen the link with Brazilian
culture and the value of popular traditions. As well as stimulating creativity, these
activities produce moments of joy and reflection, fostering a greater emotional
connection with nature and with others (students, staff and volunteers). Another
striking aspect was realizing the social and educational effect of these actions. By
involving mothers, children, students and hospital staff, the garden has become a
space for exchanging knowledge and raising environmental awareness. The visits
and workshops sparked an interest in sustainable practices and valuing biodiversity,
as well as promoting a sense of belonging and community responsibility. And we
took the children and families of the Pediatric Clinics bundles of flowers and
medicinal herbs from the seasonal harvest, with the music of the season, bridging
the gap between nature and the Clinic, including the beauty, joy and harmony of
nature in the hospital's routine.

Conclusion:
We conclude that the experience of the HU Backyard syntropic garden has been
fundamental in reinforcing our commitment to sustainability and health care. It
exemplifies how simple actions of cultivation and coexistence with nature can
transform lives, promote integral health and strengthen human bonds in a hospital
environment. This experience confirmed the importance of integrating agricultural,
artistic and therapeutic practices in the context of health, contributing to a fairer, more balanced and harmonious society";"Hypothesis
The use of social therapy interventions applied to therapeutic resources in the environment of the Backyard-Hospital Universitario and Pediatric-Clinic can contribute to well-being with nature and humanization in the quality of live of those involved, including knowledge and awareness.";;"The hospital environment involves the complexity of human existence in a state of illness. Learning how to weave life goes beyond the mere interpretation of chemical-physical processes, because life, in its essence, transcends the sensory domain, it is a suprasensible reality, that is, it cannot be captured directly by the sense organs, which only apprehend its external manifestations8. Nowadays, it is extremely important to carry out interventions, research and further study into Art Therapy with nature, especially in its application to health in the context of Integrative Medicine. PICS, of which these interventions are a part, are therapeutic approaches that aim to prevent health problems, promote well-being and help patients recover. These approaches value attentive listening, the strengthening of the therapeutic bond and harmony between the individual, the environment and society. A significant obstacle is the scarcity of scientific studies that justify and support the incorporation of these therapies into the hospital environment. This reinforces the need for more in-depth research. Goethe and Steiner's Phenomenology in the Art of Nature interventions increase health-related quality of life, help self-esteem and mood, reduce symptoms of anxiety, depression and pain, improve emotion , collaboration with the humanizing force of man with nature, man with himself and the humaanizing force of man in the social process.

Complementary spaces within academic training, such as university extension activities, include these practices to offer PICS-based care to the academic community. This approach has gained greater legitimacy since the implementation of the “circularization” of extension activities in 2022, established by the Ministry of Education (Resolution No. 7/2018). This process aims to integrate and formally recognize PICS actions that, until now, have occurred sporadically within certain undergraduate programs. This tendency is reinforced by the dialogical nature of PICS, its emphasis on active listening, the building of therapeutic relationships, its multiprofessional and interdisciplinary characteristics, and the provision of holistic care — all rooted in social and cultural dimensions shared by both PICS and the practice of university extension. This report aims to share the experience of implementing a curricular extension component titled Integrative and Complementary Health Practices, offered to students from the Biomedical Science, Nursing, and Physiotherapy programs. The initiative was carried out in partnership with the PET Equidade Entre-Laços (Education through Work Program for Equity), which promotes the value of current and future SUS (Brazilian Unified Health System) workers.;Following a planning phase and needs assessment conducted by PET and the Municipal Health Department (SMS), selected health units were identified and action plans developed. Students underwent training in PICS, specifically auriculotherapy and facial massage therapy (Tui Na), and were then assigned to health units under the supervision of faculty members from the Bahian School of Medicine and Public Health (EBMSP). PET students were responsible for recording and monitoring the PICS-based care provided to health workers and service users at five health units: UBS Cosme de Farias, USF Candeal Pequeno, UBS Saboeiro, USF Doron, and Aristides Maltês Hospital. Demographic data — including race, gender, age, and employment status — as well as work-related variables were collected, with the aim of future analysis of the profile of female workers who engage with PICS. The activities took place over eight consecutive weeks, each session lasting 2 to 3 hours, with groups of 10 students per unit. Each session involved collective integrative practices (e.g. yoga, meditation, Qi Gong, pranayama breathing techniques, music therapy, art therapy, Lian Gong, medicinal plants, and aromatherapy), followed by individual care in the form of facial massage (Tui Na) and auriculotherapy. Each session concluded with collective feedback, evaluation, and planning for the next meeting.;The students’ main impressions recorded in field diaries and written reports were that the meetings were characterized by attentive listening and the exchange of experiences among workers, students, and extension participants, as well as by guidance on self-care. Collective care emerged as a generator of social support, while individual practices provided care centered on each person's uniqueness. Throughout the process, the strength of collective care in building social support networks became evident, contributing to a more supportive and welcoming work environment that fosters physical, emotional, and social wellbeing. The combination of active listening and integrative practices enabled professionals to feel valued, heard, and recognized as active agents in their own health journeys. For students, these spaces provided concrete experiences of holistic care and interprofessional collaboration, highlighting the importance of training that goes beyond technical competence to embrace humanization and dialogue with communities. These outcomes underscore the significance of extension activities in health education, particularly by promoting practical experiences that integrate scientific knowledge, empathy, listening, and commitment to the guiding principles of the SUS.;For students, this experience has been profoundly enriching. The opportunity to listen to SUS professionals and service users brought them closer to their future work environments. Engaging with PICS-based care across different moments of the project allowed students to observe both the health demands of female workers and the differentiated care that PICS can offer. The experience reinforces the university’s social role in training professionals committed to comprehensive care, equity, and the transformation of health realities in collaboration with the communities they serve.;"Integrative and complementary health practices; Health Workers; curricular extension"

Bignardi with his transdisciplinary team has developed a method to reach a consensus in a supradisciplinary diagnosis adopting phenomenological technics. In the health field, we identified opportunities for the application of phenomenological science as a resource to overcome the impermeability of watertight disciplinary areas, given the need for a consensual supradisciplinary diagnosis. 
The German Hospital Oswaldo Cruz , recognized for its excellence in care and innovation, in conjunction with its School of Health Sciences Education, promoted a workshop of ""Phenomenology applied to Health: promotion and assistance"", that took place in the  Trianon Masp Park in São Paulo, the German Hospital Forest Oswaldo Cruz and in Botanical Garden of São Paulo (where there is garden and forest living side by side), in which the health professionals actively participated in an educational process, in which we observed the potential of this process as a means of equipping participants to apply phenomenological science, developing the potential for phenomenological observation of plants and people, and their perceptions in relation to the experiences experienced in this workshop.
 The workshop program consisted of a first day presenting theory and experiments in urban nature and a second day at the Botanical Garden with three steps: 1st walking in the park (garden) and after in the forest, answering the question: what the difference between the two environments is; 2nd specific plant observed by a group of 4 to 6 people; 3rd person observed using the same technique reaching a supradisciplinary diagnosis, through colours and forms expressed on a white paper.
At the end of the workshop, participants were invited to answer a questionnaire with eight questions about their experience, including their perceptions regarding the difference between forest and garden, the theme of phenomenology, the experience of phenomenological observation of plants and people, and the perspective of applying it in their personal and professional lives.
We base this experience report on the phenomenological method of research, which presents itself as an alternative for investigating the fullness of the human being, capable of encompassing the totality of man, looking at things in themselves, in the sense that the entire process of knowledge production should be based on primary perceptions or the original meaning derived from lived experience (Husser, 1996).";The purpose of this paper is to share and present the experience of an educational living class in a Botanical Garden affects the experience of individuals, exposing  a group of post graduates students of Transdisciplinar Integrative Health course who had not yet experienced phenomenological observation in practice (Group A) and and professionals in the health or human sciences who were coming into contact with the topic for the first time (Group B),  to a precise observation of plants and people following phenomenological steps culminating with the expression in colours and forms of the plant and people observed.;"Answers were about the experience during the workshop, concerning sensitivity, emotions, perceptions, and intellectual conclusions. Postgraduate students expressed their experience in the workshop with a more in-depth look and with greater prospects for personal and professional application. They understood phenomenology as a tool to reach true behind patients claim, amplifying the perception of each person in his vulnerability and complexity; and the phenomenological appreciation of plants has been experienced as an integration of knowledges, a marvellous feeling emerging for within, overcoming external concepts, allowing a feeling of being one with every living creature. In the experience of observing the person, they recognized a naked welcome, listening with the heart, similarities between all living beings
Individuals who had their first contact with the subject were able to bring positive perceptions of the learning and applications in everyday life, expressing interest in delving deeper into the subject. They perceived phenomenology with scepticism, although it was possible to recognise the expansion that arises with this view, making possible a better connection with another person; for them, the phenomenological observation of plants it was more difficult to overcome preconceptions from education, childhood, becoming constricted to forms. During the phenomenological observation of people they felt a strong need to analyse and control, felt difficult to trust in intuitive feelings, was received with resistance, although recognised as tool to that brings reality from the silence. 
The workshop experience increases binding to Nature and Spirituality, consciousness of connections, believe in intuitive feelings for postgraduate students, with the realization that  art and Nature should walk together with Health understanding, everything is connected. In the other group, the workshop aroused feelings of curiosity, fear, enthusiasm, confidence, trust, and the understanding that it is necessary to feel more than to interpret.";"Although the group of graduate students expressed their experience in the workshop with a more in-depth perspective and greater prospects for personal and professional application, we observed that individuals in the community who had their first encounter with the topic and lacked theoretical frameworks were able to bring positive perceptions of the learning and its applications in everyday life, expressing interest in delving deeper into the topic. We recognized from the participants' responses to the questionnaires that, despite the difference in depth of the workshop topic, their understanding of the experience in the garden and in the forest was similar. The group of graduate students who had affinity with the applied methodology was able to deepen their understanding through practical experience, with the experience being positive for those who had their first encounter with the topic.
Given the results observed, we recommend replicating the methodology used in the workshop to develop individuals' ability to perceive the environment, themselves, and others, strengthening connections. We believe that the methodology applied in the workshop can be expanded to include lay members of the community, as it transcends academic knowledge, providing a broader understanding of individuals in all their dimensions.";"phenomenological observation of plants and people; educational experience; primary perceptions; original meaning; Health Education"

Dowsing is employed as a complementary diagnostic tool for the individualized selection of flower essences. The ranges used are: the traditional English Bach Flower Essences and the Brazilian Saint Germain Flower Essences. 
In addition to individual flower essence sessions for mothers and family members, time at the institution is also used to conduct informational talks on flower essence therapy. These include discussions, clarification of doubts and dynamics based on the healing qualities of flowers. These talk circles foster emotional expression, understanding and greater adherence to the therapy.
Essences for autistic people are usually prepared in a sanitary alcohol gel base for topical use on the palms, according to the prescribed frequency. When preferred by mothers, they may also be formulated in oral dosage bottles or in spray, for emergency use at the institution.
Initially, the preparation and supply of flower essences were entirely managed by the therapist at no cost to families, with continuous provision of Bach essences. A partnership with the producer of Saint Germain Flower Essences ensured regular support of this range. From 2020 onwards, a private pharmacy has assumed essence preparation for AAMPARA´s public as part of its corporate social responsibility.
Before the COVID-19 pandemic, all intake forms were in paper. Post-pandemic, these were digitized, allowing enhanced individual therapeutic tracking and a collective overview of the service. 
In addition, due to researcher´s professional demands, from 2019 on, in person activities have started to be carried out by another therapist, well trained in flower essence therapy too. The researcher has continued attending the autistic public remotely and conducting lectures either on-line or in person for AAMPARA´s families.
The present report covers the therapeutic outcomes of 60 individuals aged 2 to 26 years, attended between September 2021 and April 2025.
Overall data indicate significant improvements in core ASD symptoms, particularly social interaction (65%) and repetitive behaviours (61%). Positive changes in associated symptoms and comorbidities—such as self-injurious behaviours, enuresis, food selectivity, and sleep disorders—were also reported. In addition, the quickness parents report noticing positive changes reaches the sum of 61% in a period of less than month (18%) and 43% in a month.
";"AAMPARA´s public have a very limited financial condition. Some families depend on government benefits to survive and have multiple autistic children. Due to an increased demand of specialized autism professionals, AAMPARA had to implement a social fee to maintain therapeutic services. However, even this can be unaffordable for some families. Therefore, the institution public big rotativity prevents a long-term tracking and comprehensive data collection.
Another challenge is the limited literacy of many caregivers, which affect the quality of answers on intake forms and understanding of flower essence healing paradigm. Therefore, the presence of a therapist to facilitate activities is essential to promote therapeutic adhesion.
";"Flower essence therapy implementation at AAMPARA resulted from a meeting between the researcher and its president, who has agreed to trying flower essences for her 17-year-old daughter. The young lady has suffered from sleep disorders, since an autistic regression at 18 months. Both parents used to alternate during the nights due to her restless sleep and intense self-injuring movements. The family have tried different treatments without success. Initially suspicious and hopeless, the mother consented to topical application of essences on her daughter’s hands. Within a month, the young lady was sleeping deeply and peacefully, surprising her parents.  Both mother and daughter continue to use flower essences until today.
Since AAMPARA´s public has a restricted access to conventional therapies, flower essence therapy has emerged as a key complementary intervention for its further development.
The present report reflects collective data obtained through Initial Evaluation and Follow-Up forms, aligned with the Brazilian academic calendar:  forms are distributed at the beginning of the year and before or after mid- and end-of-year holidays.
The follow-up data confirm consistent improvements in key ASD areas, especially social interaction (65%) and repetitive behaviours (61%). Caregivers frequently report rapid onset of positive changes. In addition, the not at all option remains low or absent across nearly all evaluation items, suggesting broad-spectrum efficacy. Although the degree of improvement varies, each person received a personalized formula, demonstrating the importance of individualized approach. Issues such as sleep disorders, food selectivity, and urinary control showed notable progress. Even small improvements can have a profound impact on family well-being.
";"The implementation of flower essence therapy depends on the kind of institution and staff.  At AAMPARA, the hybrid service model has proven feasible for a limited number of families. However, for broader application, it is essential to plan how essences will be provided for the public. AAMPARA has opted to fully support the provision of flower essences to its public.

In Brazil, since Flower essence therapy is already included in the Brazilian National Health Service (SUS) and many professionals’ councils have already regulated the use of flower essences by their members, offering this service at public health units, aimed for people with autism, could be of considerable help for low-income families all across the country.
At AAMPARA, all therapists involved in the service undergo specific training to ensure competent and ethical care.
The positive outcomes observed at AAMPARA Autism support further scientific research to consolidate the use of flower essences as a natural and safe complementary intervention for people with autism of all ages.

Grounded in diverse medical rationalities—such as Reflexology, Neurophysiological Biomedicine, and Traditional Chinese Medicine—this approach has been widely implemented in Brazil, with positive impacts on the mental health and quality of life of healthcare professionals and university students. 
This abstract presents the institutional experience of implementing auriculotherapy at the Humanization and Care Unit of the Health Sciences Center, Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (CCS/UFRJ). Established in 2017, the unit was designed to support the academic community—including professors, students, and administrative staff—through a holistic model of care that acknowledges healing as an integrative process involving body, mind, and spirit. The initiative emerges within a broader context of growing mental health challenges in academic settings and adopts the biopsychosocial-spiritual model of health, addressing the physical, emotional, social, and spiritual dimensions of human experience.
The current auriculotherapy protocol was initiated in March 2025. The service is offered free of charge and voluntarily provided by a healthcare professional certified in auriculotherapy by the Federal University of Santa Catarina and the Brazilian Ministry of Health. Sessions are held once a week (Tuesdays), from 10:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m., by prior appointment via the unit’s email. The practice is promoted through social media and posters placed in high-traffic campus areas.
Each session lasts approximately 10 minutes, with the initial appointment taking 20 to 30 minutes to allow for a more comprehensive assessment. The protocol recommends a treatment plan of 5 to 8 sessions, depending on the individual's progress and needs. On the first day, no more than 10 auricular points are selected to be used throughout all sessions. At the end of each session, participants are advised to retain the mustard seeds on the auricle for five days and to perform gentle self-massage on the stimulated points three times daily to enhance therapeutic effects.
The methodology includes: (1) compassionate listening and presence, anamnesis, and a structured intake interview conducted during the first session; (2) application of mustard seeds to auricular points based on the main complaint; and (3) laying on of hands over the auricular region—a culturally sensitive practice acknowledged across multiple traditions.
During the initial consultation, data are collected on sociodemographic profile, clinical history, medication use, religiosity and spirituality, previous experience with complementary or spiritual practices, and emotional or psychological distress associated with the main complaint. Pain intensity—both physical and emotional—is measured using the Verbal Numeric Scale (VNS, range 0-10) before, during, and after the intervention. All information is recorded in internal reports, in accordance with Brazil’s General Data Protection Law (LGPD – Law No. 13,709/2018).
";The escalating mental health crisis in academia calls for sustainable, concrete responses. In an environment marked by overload, competition, and isolation, this initiative offers institutional care, support, and prevention through an integrative complementary health practice coupled with active and compassionate listening. It fosters self-care and belonging via a biopsychosocial-spiritual model, challenging the prevailing mechanistic approach and promoting cultural transformation toward holistic health in academia.;"A preliminary analysis of data collected between March and July 2025 shows that 9 individuals were treated by the sector, including 2 administrative staff members, 1 doctoral student, and 3 undergraduate students. The average age of participants was 31 years. A total of 89% self-identified as Black and 11% as White.
All participants (100%) reported anxiety as one of their main complaints and approximately 44% also reported feelings of worry. Fear and sadness were each reported by 22% of participants. Additionally, 78% reported weakened willpower, 44% reported pessimism, 67% experienced insomnia, 67% reported having fixed ideas, and 78% described intrusive thinking patterns.
Regarding physical pain, 56% of participants reported experiencing some level of pain during the initial interview: one person described mild pain (VNS=3), one moderate pain (VNS=4), another moderate pain (VNS=5), and two reported severe pain (VNS=8). Emotional pain was reported by 78% of participants: one person described mild emotional pain (VNS=3), two reported moderate emotional pain (VNS=5 and 6), and three reported severe emotional pain (VNS=7).
Among the 22% who completed the treatment, 11% reported a reduction in physical pain from moderate to mild (initial VNS=4, final VNS=2), and 11% experienced a decrease in emotional pain from moderate to no pain between the first and third sessions (initial VNS=6, third session VNS=0). However, from the third to the final session, emotional pain increased to a severe level (VNS=8). Despite this, the participant reported engaging in self-care practices, attending psychotherapy, and actively seeking ways to address emotional challenges.
Furthermore, 44% of participants reported attending psychotherapy, 66% reported engaging in physical activity or physiotherapy, and 67% engaged in spiritual practices such as prayer, uplifting reading, or meditation. A total of 78% stated that their spirituality or faith helps them cope with their current difficulties. At the time of analysis, 22% of participants were still undergoing treatment, while 56% discontinued the proposed treatment before completing the number of sessions recommended by the therapist. An investigation is underway to better understand the reasons behind treatment discontinuation in each case.
Additionally, we are exploring the possibility of offering a training course to prepare more volunteer auriculotherapists, aiming to increase service capacity and expand support through this practice.";Key challenges include improving data management, training new auriculotherapists, expanding services, refining protocols, establishing longitudinal follow-up, conducting research to evaluate outcomes, and raising awareness among academic leadership. Institutional recognition with financial and logistical support is essential for sustainability and impact. Integrating care practices into university routines is both a therapeutic and a political-ethical imperative given the widespread psychological distress in academic communities.;"Auriculotherapy; mental health; Universities"

In response to growing global recognition of Integrative Medicine (IM) and its potential contributions to holistic, patient-centered care, FMABC became the first medical school in Brazil to formally introduce a structured IM course in 2017.

This elective course was designed to fill critical gaps in conventional medical training by providing students with scientific, evidence-based exposure to complementary practices such as acupuncture, herbal medicine, Ayurveda, Reiki, and others. Initially launched in 2017 with one pilot group, the course gradually expanded through growing student demand and institutional support.

Each edition of the course offers a 40-hour workload, divided into lectures, experiential learning, and extracurricular activities. Materials and procedures include academic articles, clinical case discussions, hands-on demonstrations, and guided practice sessions. The course is coordinated by FMABC faculty and delivered by nationally and internationally recognized professionals in their respective IM areas. Evaluation includes attendance, participation, and a written exam.

The timeline of the initiative includes:

2017: Pilot implementation
2018: Launch of the Integrative Medicine Academic League
2018–present: Course expansion, institutional collaborations, and national/international recognition";"
Problems Addressed
Despite official recognition of Integrative Medicine (IM) by the Brazilian Ministry of Health, its inclusion in undergraduate medical education remains minimal. At FMABC and most medical schools in Brazil, students previously lacked formal exposure to integrative health practices.

This led to the following challenges:

Limited curricular space for non-conventional, holistic health perspectives.
Lack of scientific, evidence-based exposure to complementary therapies, with knowledge often restricted to informal or anecdotal sources.
Persistent misconceptions about the scientific validity and clinical relevance of IM.
There was a clear educational need to create an academically rigorous space for medical students to critically engage with integrative practices and develop a more comprehensive understanding of patient care.";"
Results
Since its implementation in 2017, the IM course at FMABC has yielded notable outcomes:

Enrollment and demand: Over 120 students per year participate in the course. Capacity is regularly exceeded, leading to waitlists.
Student feedback: More than 85% of participants report positive shifts in empathy, communication skills, and openness to interdisciplinary care.
Academic League: In 2018, the Integrative Medicine Academic League was established, offering ongoing student engagement through seminars, events, and peer education.
Interdepartmental collaboration: The course has facilitated partnerships with clinical and preclinical departments and integration with internship opportunities, especially in Family and Community Medicine.
Research and outreach: Student-led research projects and community extension initiatives have emerged from the program.
International recognition: In 2018, the program received an award at the International Congress of Integrative Medicine and Health, validating its educational innovation.";"Based on FMABC’s experience, the following recommendations are suggested for institutions considering similar initiatives:

Start as an elective: This allows for pilot testing, stakeholder engagement, and gradual scaling based on demand.
Invest in faculty training: Address skepticism and ensure scientific rigor through continuous education and access to updated literature.
Use a critical, evidence-based approach: Present integrative practices within a scientific framework to encourage informed inquiry.
Collaborate with experts: Involve certified professionals and researchers from diverse IM areas to enrich course content.
Create continuity structures: Support academic leagues or student-led initiatives to sustain interest beyond the course.
Address institutional resistance: Use data, dialogue, and phased implementation to overcome barriers such as curriculum rigidity and bias.
Seek visibility and partnerships: Participate in academic events and network with other institutions to expand impact and gain support.
FMABC’s initiative illustrates that it is both possible and beneficial to integrate Integrative Medicine into medical education, fostering more empathetic, holistic, and reflective future physicians.";"Integrative Medicine in Medical Education; Curriculum Development; Complementary and Integrative Health Practices; Holistic and Patient-Centered Care; Educational Innovation in Health Professions"

Similar to initiatives already implemented in several European countries, it is plausible that the intervention of musicians specially trained to work in hospital settings and other care environments (Integrative Musicians) could serve as a humanizing strategy for individuals with CKD undergoing HD, potentially resulting in improvements in these adverse conditions.Objective: To identify the potential influences of musicians’ performance, through musical intervention (MI) during hemodialysis (HD) sessions, on quality of life (QoL), depression parameters, and the subjective sense of well-being of patients undergoing HD at the Dialysis and Renal Transplant Center (CDTR) in Sorocaba, SP.BRAZIL.;"Assessment Methods: Quality of life (QoL) was evaluated using the Kidney Disease and Quality of Life – Short Form (KDQOL-SF™) version 1.3 questionnaire, and depression status was assessed with the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D).
Participants: The study included 24 patients over 18 years old who had been undergoing hemodialysis for more than six months at the CDTR. Of these, 12 patients comprised the control group (no intervention), and 12 patients received the musicians’ intervention for 5 months during their regular Saturday HD sessions.
Procedures: An open-ended questionnaire was administered to patients to assess receptivity and the effects of the intervention. The participants’ responses were subjected to thematic analysis and subsequently to the Collective Subject Discourse analysis technique (Lefèvre).";"Following the intervention of the Elo Musicians at the CDTR, we observed changes both in the patients and the staff, with significant improvements in patients’ quality of life and well-being. Quality of life indicators showed enhancements in emotional health, social functioning, illness perception, and motivation to engage in activities.
Depression markers revealed that half of the patients who initially exhibited signs of depression experienced substantial improvement, no longer classified within the moderate to severe depression group according to the HAM-D scale assessment.
The patients’ subjective perceptions of the Elo Musicians’ intervention were confirmed through discourse analysis, which revealed expressions of determination and a desire for improved well-being. Additionally, improvements were noted in the social and affective relationships among the patient–staff–family triad.";"As observers of the process, despite being involved in it, we were also able to conclude that the transformative role of the musicians in the hemodialysis environment, even over a short period, triggered a significant initial change that consolidated over time. From this subsequent phase onward, the impact extended beyond the music, the musicians, and their immediate effects, leading to behavioral changes in the individuals who experienced the process.
Those involved in the project became more proactive, attentive, and sensitive toward the patients—as if discovering the person behind the “ill body.” We also observed improved relationships among staff members—as if uncovering the person behind the “colleague.” In sum, the entire hemodialysis environment underwent a profound transformation.

The Planet&AR Project was developed to identify health and environmental vulnerabilities on Maré Island, a territory historically inhabited by Indigenous populations and now home to a predominantly Quilombola community. This region faces high environmental and socioeconomic vulnerability, particularly due to industrial activities and limited access to healthcare services.
Objective: To promote medical student immersion in a vulnerable territory and to expand their understanding of the health-disease process using a planetary health approach.";Following preparatory workshops on planetary health concepts, 16 medical students participated in a 3-day immersive experience on Maré Island. The immersion included guided community walks, conversations with residents and health workers, and observation of living conditions and environmental risks. A qualitative and exploratory research design was adopted. Group reflections and structured discussion circles were used to stimulate critical thinking and document students' learning. The pedagogical method was grounded in experiential learning and socioenvironmental contextualization.;"Results
During the immersion, students identified multiple determinants of health, including water and air pollution, poor sanitation infrastructure, and systemic inequalities. They also recognized the cultural resilience and environmental knowledge embedded in the local population’s way of life. Students reported a shift in perspective, gaining a deeper understanding of the links between environmental degradation, climate change, and social injustice. The experience fostered a more integrative view of clinical practice, particularly in contexts of vulnerability.
Discussion
The immersive experience proved to be a valuable pedagogical tool for introducing planetary health in medical education. By engaging directly with a marginalized community, students were able to reflect on the limitations of traditional biomedical training and the need for a broader, interdisciplinary approach. Although no formal evaluation was conducted, the documented reflections and group discussions provided insights into the transformative potential of such experiences. Further studies with pre- and post-immersion assessments are recommended to evaluate long-term educational impact.";This experience may serve as a model for integrating planetary health concepts into the curricula of Brazilian medical schools. This approach not only enhances academic training but also equips physicians with a holistic perspective essential for addressing the challenges posed by climate change and social inequality. Initiatives like the Planet&AR Project are therefore vital for transforming medical education and advancing responses to both environmental and health crises.;"Medical education; Planetary Health; vulnerable community"

";"Mental disorders are illnesses with psychological manifestations associated with some functional impairment resulting from biological, social, psychological, genetic, physical, or chemical dysfunction. Integrative and Complementary Health Practices (PICS) are alternatives for preventing and treating health problems, as stated by the Ministry of Health: ""These are treatments that use therapeutic resources based on traditional knowledge, aimed at preventing various diseases, such as depression and hypertension"" (Brazil, 2020). They stimulate natural mechanisms ""through effective and safe technologies, with an emphasis on supportive listening, the development of therapeutic bonds, and the integration of human beings with the environment and society"" (Brazil, 2018, p. 7). Aromatherapy ""is indicated for various mental health conditions, such as insomnia, stress, anxiety, pain, depression, and other organic diseases and discomforts."" The aroma and particles released by essential oils stimulate different parts of the brain, helping to alleviate various symptoms and pathologies (FIOCRUZ, 2025). Meditation is an ancient practice that ""consists of training the focus of attention in a non-analytical or discriminative way, reducing repetitive thinking, and cognitive reorientation."" Furthermore, it ""promotes favorable changes in mood and improves cognitive performance, providing greater integration between mind, body, and the outside world"" (Brasil, 2025).
";;"This study concludes that Integrative and Complementary Practices, Aromatherapy, and Meditation, used as care technologies in a mental health group, contributed to promoting well-being, greater intimacy and self-awareness, relaxation, stress reduction, improved mood, and, consequently, helped promote mental health.
