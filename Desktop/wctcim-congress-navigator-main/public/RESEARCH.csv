Despite this, few female physicians are documented, and their histories are brief and vague. Confucianism, which gained prominence during this period15, reinforced gender segregation16, limiting women’s access to education. Texts like “Model Family” (Ji?fàn) discouraged women from studying or practicing medicine or music17. “Confucianization of medicine” further marginalized women18. In 990, the Imperial Medical Department restricted medical practice to men, discouraging female doctors, midwives, and healers19,20.
Three female doctors are mentioned, and their stories often blend with folklore.  
Zh?ngXi?oNiángz?: Mentioned in “Records of YíJi?n” (1162)21, she was wife of a surgeon who learned medicine from an old wanderer and specialized in beauty formulas. Legends claim she cured an imperial concubine and Emperor RénZ?ng, earning her title “Lady Zh?ng”.
XíngShì: Referenced in “Rustic Conversations of Eastern Qí” (??)22, she was known for diagnosing pregnancy complications and predicting death through pulse reading alone.
W?YuánZhào: Described in “Records of YíJi?n” and in collection of biographies “T?ngJiàn True Immortal Body Collection” (??)23, she was portrayed as a priestess with transcendental abilities, diagnosing and healing patients without physical contact. She was also said to communicate with spirits.
Discussion
Marginalization of women in education and medicine during Sòng explains why few female doctors were documented, unlike other periods24. Their stories often resemble fables, emphasizing miraculous abilities rather than medical expertise. Zh?ngXi?oNiángz?’s tale mirrors folklore, while XíngShì’s pulse-reading skills are exaggerated in works, like “Journey to West”25. Technical medical texts, such as “Classic of Pulse”26 and “Yellow Emperor’s Inner Classic”27, do not mention such feats. W?YuánZhào’s story is the most preserved, reflecting Taoist-Buddhist28 influences that recognized women’s spiritual and healing potential29. Unlike Confucianism, Taoism maintained a cosmological balance of y?n-yáng30, valuing women’s roles.";"During Sòng, depictions of female doctors in few records found emphasized mystical abilities, close to folklore or myth. It suggests that this may reflect their exclusion from orthodox medicine, perhaps due to ""Confusionalization of medicine"" described by Lan12.";"history of Chinese medicine; female doctors; Sòng dynasty"

Objectives: This study aimed to explore the experiences of participants pertaining to knowledge translation (KT) and dissemination in clinical research and to discuss the barriers and facilitators. The purpose of the study was to reduce current knowledge-to-practice gaps, ensure accurate and accessible knowledge reaches the widest audience possible, and to provide informed guidance for individuals and groups.";This qualitative study included 14 participants who took part in an evidence-based medicine dissemination competition in 2023. Semi-structured interviews were carried out with participants remotely between December 2023 to January 2024. Participants’ experiences, perceptions, expectations, and recommendations regarding KT and dissemination in clinical research were explored and transcription data was analyzed using thematic analysis.;A total of 3 domains, encompassing 10 themes with 29 associated subthemes emerged. Within the domain of KT, this study discussed themes including priorities when selecting clinical research for dissemination, processing of clinical research content text, expressive presentation of clinical research information, elements of knowledge brokers, and reflective understanding of KT. For the domain of knowledge dissemination, this study delved into themes related to approaches of knowledge dissemination and implementation strategies for knowledge dissemination. Finally, this study considered the domain of the perspectives of knowledge users, addressing themes including resonating with the audience, scientific literacy, and practical utilization for knowledge users.;Appropriate and timely dissemination of research evidence is a key priority for many stakeholders, including academics, clinicians, patients as well as health institutions. Those involved in disseminating research should consider the potential benefits of utilizing social media platforms responsibly, the flexible utilization of artificial intelligence and the need for a multidisciplinary team with diverse backgrounds to jointly facilitate the effective translation and dissemination of clinical research findings, in order to optimize the overall impact of new research.;"knowledge translation; public dissemination; social media; in-depth interview"

Among these approaches, acupuncture and phytotherapy stand out, which use natural and holistic methods. The objective of this study was to identify which ICPs are most effective in reducing pain in patients diagnosed with osteoarthritis.;The research was based on a scoping review, carried out in the databases: BVS (Virtual Health Library), Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System on-line (MEDLINE/PUBMED) and EMBASE/ELSEVIER, using the Health Science Descriptors (DeCS): pain/chronic pain, integrative practices and osteoarthritis and their corresponding terms in English. Original articles published between 2020 and 2024 were included. The new Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) checklist was used. The initial search resulted in 1643 records, of which 278 were duplicates, 952 were excluded because they were not empirical cases of intervention, 219 did not have sufficient information to assess their interventionist nature. After a detailed reading, 138 articles were disregarded, resulting in 81 studies on interventions in the work context.;The research identified acupuncture and phytotherapy as the main PICs applied. Acupuncture, which originated in traditional Chinese medicine, is known for using needles inserted into specific points of the body to stimulate the flow of vital energy and promote balance in the body. This practice stands out as one of the most studied therapies, accounting for approximately 34% of the research conducted. This data may reflect both the broad acceptance of this practice and the accumulation of evidence that supports the continuation of studies. In general, the literature indicates that acupuncture can contribute to the relief of pain caused by osteoarthritis. Phytotherapy uses medicinal plants and their derivatives to prevent and treat various health conditions. This practice accounts for approximately 19% of the studies and therefore also stands out as a relevant field of research. Among the most mentioned species, Miconia albicans and Curcuma longa stand out. The studies suggest the standardization and rigorous validation of these methods as fundamental for integration into treatments, in line with the guidelines of the Unified Health System (SUS), which seeks to offer more complete and patient-centered care, transforming the way pain is approached and managed.;With the primary objective of promoting the individual’s balance and comprehensive well-being, PICs encompass a diverse range of therapies that move away from the traditional biomedical model, valuing the connection between body, mind and spirit. The SUS, in turn, plays a crucial role in this process, by incorporating PICs into its guidelines and offering citizens more complete and humanized care. By embracing the holistic vision of PICs and integrating them into the available therapeutic arsenal, the SUS is transforming the way pain is approached and treated, and paving the way for a future in which health is synonymous with comprehensive well-being.;"SUS; Pain; Osteoarthritis; Integrative Practices; health promotion"

Emotional disorders, such as anxiety, affected young people, adults, and also undergraduate students. Auriculotherapy is an effective intervention for the health care of individuals with emotional disorders. It is one of the 29 Integrative and Complementary Health Practices institutionalized in Brazil’s Unified Health System, recognized as an important health care strategy. Needles are the most common devices for administering the intervention. With technological advancements and the aim of making the technique safer, new application devices have gained prominence, such as low-intensity laser. The reduced invasiveness, compared to needle-based intervention, is a significant factor that enhances acceptance of laser treatment. This study aims to compare the effectiveness of auriculotherapy using laser and needles in treating anxiety among undergraduate students in the post-COVID-19 era.;"A randomized clinical trial, approved by a research ethics committee (protocol no. 5.700.107), was conducted with 397 undergraduate students allocated into the ""Needle"" group (NG; n=197) and the ""Laser"" group (LG; n=200). Five auricular acupuncture sessions were performed. Assessments were conducted before and after the treatment using the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and measurements of heart and respiratory rates. Data were analyzed using Generalized Estimating Equations with a 5% significance level.";Anxiety levels were 55.90±0.49 in NG and 55.72±0.46 in LG, decreasing to 53.61±0.57 (p=0.003) and 54.19±0.52 (p=0.028), respectively. There was no statistically significant difference between the groups in the initial (p=0.798) and final (p=0.340) assessments. Regarding heart rate, it was 81.03±1.011 in NG and 81.12±0.81 in LG, decreasing to 80.27±0.93 (p=0.580) and 80.67±0.769 (p=0.691), respectively. No statistically significant difference was found between the groups in the initial (p=0.945) and final (p=0.737) assessments.

Various devices can be used for its application, with needles being the most traditional. With technological advancements, new devices have gained prominence, such as low-intensity laser. Beyond assessing the effectiveness of these devices, it is essential to evaluate user satisfaction and the occurrence of adverse reactions to ensure the safe implementation of the intervention. This study aimed to assess satisfaction with treatment and the occurrence of adverse reactions in auriculotherapy using needles and laser.;A cross-sectional study, approved by an ethics committee (protocol no. 5.700.107), was conducted with 340 undergraduate students who underwent auriculotherapy treatment using either semi-permanent needles (NG) (n=166) or laser (LG) (n=174). At the end of treatment, satisfaction was assessed using a five-point Likert scale (1 - extremely dissatisfied to 5 - extremely satisfied), and possible adverse reactions were graded from zero (no discomfort) to 10 (unbearable discomfort). Data were analyzed using Pearson’s Chi-square test, Fisher’s Exact test, and the Mann-Whitney test, with a 5% significance level.;"Regarding participants' satisfaction levels, 39.6% (n=21) in NG and 41.5% (n=22) in LG were extremely satisfied; 41.5% (n=22) in NG and 37.7% (n=20) in LG were satisfied; 15.1% (n=8) in NG and 17.0% (n=9) in LG were uncertain; no participants in NG and 1.9% (n=1) in LG were dissatisfied; and 3.8% (n=2) and 1.9% (n=1) were extremely dissatisfied (p=0.825). Regarding the frequency of adverse reactions, the most notable were: ear pain – NG: n=46 (86.8%), LG: n=6 (11.3%), p<0.001; ear hyperemia – NG: n=31 (58.5%), LG: n=10 (18.9%), p<0.001; ear pruritus – NG: n=29 (54.7%), LG: n=8 (15.1%), p<0.001; intervention-related headache – NG: n=19 (35.8%), LG: n=17 (32.1%), p=0.682; ear edema – NG: n=16 (30.2%), LG: n=0 (0.0%), p<0.001; ear scaling – NG: n=12 (22.6%), LG: n=3 (5.7%), p=0.023; enlarged lymph nodes – NG: n=8 (15.1%), LG: n=2 (3.8%), p=0.093; ear flushing – NG: n=0, LG: n=1 (1.9%), p=1.000. Finally, the intensity of adverse reaction symptoms, expressed as mean (standard deviation), was: ear pain – NG: 3.23 (2.44), LG: 0.19 (0.65), p<0.001; ear hyperemia – NG: 1.89 (2.18), LG: 0.23 (0.50), p<0.001; ear pruritus – NG: 2.28 (2.77), LG: 0.28 (0.74), p<0.001; intervention-related headache – NG: 1.30 (2.39), LG: 1.11 (1.91), p=0.761; ear edema – NG: 0.74 (1.51), LG: 0.00 (0.00), p<0.001; ear scaling – NG: 0.66 (1.55), LG: 0.11 (0.50), p=0.012; enlarged lymph nodes – NG: 0.55 (1.46), LG: 0.13 (0.73), p=0.048; ear flushing – NG: 0.00, LG: 0.02 (0.14), p=0.317.";Most participants were satisfied with the treatments.

Regular cold water exposure has demonstrated health benefits on physical and mental health, yet investigations have been adult-focused. Kneipp cold water therapy stems from a 150-year, holistic, traditional medicine practice with adults and children. The objective is to share lessons from pediatric research with Kneipp cold water therapy and apply this to future cold water investigations and assessments.;The Kita Kneipp Study implemented a Kneipp therapeutic concept with kindergartens in and around Berlin Germany in the intervention arm of a mixed methods, two-arm randomized controlled trial. Qualitative data including expert interviews conducted with kindergarten staff and intervention-focused ethnographies describe how Kneipp therapy is being applied in a kindergarten-setting. Inductive and deductive content analysis was used to assess how cold water can be implemented and children motivated to engage with cold water in a pediatric setting. Examples are mapped to potential future research with children using cold water.;Examples from the Kita Kneipp Study demonstrate how children are motivated through play, observing exemplary peer-behavior, teaching and displaying self-efficacy to take part in health promotion research using cold water.

Control rats were provided with water and feed ad-libitum, the rats were sacrificed 24 hours after drug administration. 
The impact of DFP against Cisplatin-induce hepatic toxicity and histopathologic changes were examined through Hematoxylin/eosin and Periodic Acid Schiff stains, along with various biochemical and redox biomarkers evaluation in the liver tissues. The general body weight gain of the rats also observed. Chromatographic, spectroscopic, and in vitro antioxidative assays were performed to elucidate the phytochemical content, structural features, and antioxidative potentials of DFP
";The study found that compared with the control rats, cisplatin significantly increased liver injury markers, lipid peroxidation, and nitric oxide levels, meanwhile, it decreased hepatic reduced glutathione, glutathione peroxidase, Catalase, and sodium dismutase activities at p<0.05. DFP significantly improved liver function tests, reduced malondialdehyde, nitric oxide, and raised glutathione. DFP, on the other hand, suppressed these markers and oxidative stress and histology of the liver corroborated the biochemical observations. Additionally, the chemical constituents in DFP showed significant antioxidative and functional properties. ;The findings suggest that DFP could offer effective protection against cisplatin-induced hepatotoxicity which could be beneficial for combination therapy in cancer treatment.;"Cisplatin; Hepatotoxicity; Phoenix dactylifera; antioxidants; Hepatoprotection"

These traditional practices remain central to maternal and child healthcare, even as modern medical interventions increasingly permeate rural settings. The intersection of indigenous knowledge and biomedical approaches raises critical questions about healthcare accessibility, cultural preservation, and community autonomy.

This research is motivated by the need to understand how traditional maternal and childbirth practices persist and evolve in the face of modernisation and health system integration. There is a significant gap in both academic literature and policy frameworks regarding the unique healthcare challenges faced by nomadic communities, often resulting in healthcare interventions that are poorly adapted to their sociocultural context. This study seeks to fill this gap by documenting, analysing, and interpreting the traditional maternal and childbirth practices of pastoral nomadic women in Somaliland.

The primary objective of this study is to document and analyse traditional maternal health and childbirth practices among pastoral nomadic women, examining their cultural significance and their potential compatibility with modern healthcare systems. Additionally, the research aims to identify barriers to healthcare access and explore how indigenous practices can inform culturally responsive healthcare policies.
";"This ongoing study employs a qualitative research approach, grounded in ethnographic methodology. Fieldwork has been conducted in pastoral nomadic settlements across Somaliland, involving in-depth interviews and participant observation. Key informants include midwives, traditional birth attendants, community elders, and women who have experienced childbirth within nomadic settings.

Ethnographic interviews are guided by a semi-structured format, allowing for flexibility and depth of inquiry while maintaining consistency across participants. Topics explored include pregnancy beliefs, childbirth rituals, postpartum care, and community health support networks. Special attention is given to rituals such as taraaraysi (spiritual gatherings for pregnant women) and umal-igadh (cultural practices related to lactation and grief after infant loss).

Data analysis follows thematic coding, with emerging themes continuously revised as new data is collected. Thematic analysis is complemented by cross-referencing with existing literature on maternal health and indigenous practices. Ethical considerations include obtaining informed consent, ensuring confidentiality, and respecting the cultural integrity of the community.
";Preliminary findings indicate that traditional practices are deeply rooted in social cohesion and spiritual beliefs, often emphasizing the community's collective responsibility for maternal health. Practices like taraaraysi are not only spiritually significant but also serve as social support mechanisms, fostering solidarity among women. However, nomadic women face critical barriers to formal healthcare access, including geographic isolation, mobility patterns, and social norms that privilege traditional practices over biomedical interventions. Tensions arise when modern health policies fail to accommodate traditional knowledge systems, resulting in healthcare gaps and mistrust towards medical professionals;This research highlights the importance of preserving indigenous knowledge while building collaborative partnerships between traditional practitioners and biomedical professionals. Recognising the inherent value of traditional maternal health practices not only supports cultural preservation but also contributes to more inclusive and effective healthcare strategies for pastoral nomadic communities.;"Pastoral Nomadic Communities; Cultural Preservation; Indigenous Knowledge; Healthcare Access"

A situation intensified by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has contributed to burnout, absenteeism, and staff turnover. Stress arises when external demands exceed coping capacity. Mind-body medicine is a proven strategy for enhancing resilience and managing stress. This qualitative study aims to develop a tailored mind-body medicine intervention based on the specific needs of hospital employees, serving as a foundation for the SOULFOOD randomized controlled trial, which will examine whether mind-body medicine, nutrition, and complementary self-care strategies can enhance stress resilience.;This needs assessment involved five focus groups with hospital employees (n = 21) and one expert group (n = 9) to explore workplace stressors and gather input for the development of a mind-body medicine program in a hospital setting. Using purposive sampling, we recruited participants from various departments, including nurses, physicians, medical technicians, researchers, and administrative staff and from different age groups to ensure a broad range of perspectives. Additionally, an expert group consisting of health insurance professionals and hospital leaders (n = 9) was included to capture insights from key stakeholders. The semi-structured group interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed inductively using Kuckartz’s qualitative content analysis in MAXQDA. Codes were identified and grouped into categories to reveal patterns and topic frequencies. The results were discussed within an team and interpreted.;Participants reported significant stress due to workload, staff shortages, interpersonal tensions, and lack of time for self-care. There was interest in practical stress management techniques, conflict resolution training, and health promotion strategies such as exercise and nutrition. Flexibility emerged as a key requirement, particularly for shift workers. Digital and hybrid delivery formats were preferred for their accessibility and convenience. Short, actionable sessions integrated into daily routines were favoured over time-intensive formats. Experts emphasized the importance of institutional support for successful and sustainable implementation.;Healthcare workers mentioned the need for a flexible, multimodal program to manage workplace stress. Findings highlighted a demand for practical self-care tools, conflict resolution skills, and preventive health measures. These findings will be integrated in the SOULFOOD intervention development.;"Mind-body medicine; complementary medicine; Work-related Stress; Resilience; health promotion; "

This paper outlines the development of a tailored, evidence-based, theory-driven intervention designed to prevent burnout among hospital-based healthcare professionals (LAGOM program) based on mind-body medicine. During development, particular attention was paid to cooperation and constant feedback loops with various stakeholders, especially with the participants of the intervention.;The LAGOM project has been taking place at Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin and the Immanuel Hospital, Berlin since 2022. To develop, implement and evaluate the burnout prevention program, we conducted two reviews, interviews, focus groups, workshops, and used modified Intervention Mapping (IM) procedures and the Precede/Proceed logic model. In addition to the multi-professional project team, various advisory boards, including the management of the two hospitals, were involved in the project. The healthcare professionals for whom the intervention was developed were actively involved in every phase of program development.;"LAGOM (""Long-term Health-Related Organizational Concepts with Mind-Body Medicine"") includes 9-week in-person and online sessions covering stress patterns, communication, work culture reflection, self-care, and relaxation and exercise practices based on mind-body medicine. Participation in those sessions is working time. With endorsement from the management board of both hospitals, LAGOM also aims to enhance the work environment within the hospital structures, combining structural and behavioral prevention.This article details the scientific development process for a burnout prevention program, illustrating how intervention development methods can be used to improve the standards for reporting on intervention development. Employing best practice frameworks, evidence-based behavior change techniques and close collaboration with healthcare professionals enhances effectiveness of LAGOM.";The IM framework proved effective in systematically addressing the complexity of burnout prevention with mind-body medicine. Its application in other healthcare settings could help develop interventions that balance individual and structural components, tailored to the unique needs of each organization.;"Intervention development; Healthcare professionals; Burnout; Mind-body medicine; Prevention"

Metabolomic analyses have revealed distinct phytochemical profiles depending on Viscum album host tree species [1]. Additionally, seasonal variations, soil characteristics, and solvent polarity significantly influence the chemical composition of Viscum album preparations [2,3]. Our research aims to identify the bioactive compounds associated with the antitumor properties of Viscum album and to develop innovative pharmaceutical formulations based on mistletoe extracts.;"Whole fresh V. album plants were harvested from various host trees (Malus domestica, Quercus robur, Quercus petraea, Ulmus carpinifolia, Abies alba, and Pinus sylvestris) across different regions of Switzerland over the past eight years, during both summer and winter seasons, following a standardized protocol. In addition, a lipophilic extract (VALE) from the green organs (leaves and stems) of Viscum album subsp. austriacum was obtained using supercritical CO2 extraction. To improve the solubility and stability of VALE, a self-nanoemulsifying drug delivery system (SNEDDS) was developed [5]. Furthermore, a thermoresponsive hydrogel formulation was created using a dry ethanolic extract of Viscum album from Abies alba for topical transdermal application. The cytotoxic effects of ethanolic extracts, hydrogel, and SNEDDS formulations were evaluated in various tumor (melanoma, leukemia, sarcoma, breast, and prostate cancer) and non-tumor cell lines (fibroblasts, keratinocytes, and kidney cells). Analytical and cellular assays have been performed to evaluate the pharmaceutical parameters and the cytotoxic effects, respectively. The methodologies applied included: 
1)	Physicochemical characterization: LC-MS-based metabolomics, thin-layer chromatography (TLC), high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), dynamic light scattering (DLS), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM).
2)	Biological assays: In vitro cell culture, flow cytometry, spectrophotometric assays, and western blotting.";The biological assays revealed that ethanolic extracts and hydrogel formulations induced mitochondrial damage, apoptotic cell death, cell cycle arrest, and alterations in glycolytic enzyme activity in tumoral cells [3,4]. Extracts prepared with summer harvests exhibited greater cytotoxic compared to those from winter, particularly in kidney, prostate, and breast cancer cells. The hydrogel formulation, prepared via an efficient, low-energy method, showed favorable characteristics for topical use, including nanometer-sized micelles with low polydispersity index, dermal pH compatibility, non-Newtonian rheological behavior. The SNEDDS formulation was homogeneous, isotropic, and stable, and significantly improved VALE solubility. Oleanolic acid, a pentacyclic triterpene, was identified as a major active VALE compound.;Our findings emphasize the significant role of biological and physicochemical factors in the cytotoxic effects of V. album preparations. This research supports the relevance of basic scientific studies in uncovering the mechanisms of action of mistletoe extracts and their pharmaceutical formulations. Ongoing investigations aim to further explore the therapeutical potential of this traditional medicinal plant in oncology and other chronic diseases.;"Viscum album; metabolomics; biological effects; pharmaceutical formulations"

Historically, the term ""grounding"" has been used to describe the strategy of stabilizing electrical networks to protect individuals and equipment from high voltages and electric shocks. Recently, research on ""biological grounding"" has increased, where studies evaluate the effects of direct contact between the body and the Earth’s surface or via grounding equipment on the skin. These studies highlight physiological alterations and beneficial impacts on chronic pain, sleep, blood pressure, blood viscosity, and non-communicable diseases.  Previous studies have shown reductions in inflammation, improvements in pain, and enhanced quality of life. Grounding is a free, accessible method with no associated adverse effects. This review aims to consolidate findings regarding grounding’s effects on oxidative stress, highlighting health improvements and exploring existing hypotheses for these phenomena.";"This study is a review with Inclusion criteria of articles addressing the study’s central question and topics related to the effect of grounding/earthing on oxidative stress, published between 2005 and 2023. The research was conducted using the following databases: PubMed/MEDLINE, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar. Keywords included “oxidative stress,” “grounding,” and “earthing”, using the Boolean operators ""OR"" and ""AND, respectively. ";"The clinical trials reviewed demonstrate positive outcomes across a variety of conditions, including: red blood cell aggregation, cortisol levels and sleep, blood pressure, prevention and treatment of COVID-19 infections, reduction in vagal tone (associated with mortality risk) in premature infants, and pain management.
Hussain et al.(2016) state that the excessive production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS/RNS), generated during the oxidative metabolism process, has been reported to initiate the inflammatory process, leading to the synthesis and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. This relationship between oxidative stress and inflammation justifies the improvement reported for the clinical trials due to the biogrounding. PETEK (2022) wrote that oxidative stress is one of the most important factors in the body's inflammatory processes, due to an imbalance between the reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and elimination in an organism by antioxidant mechanisms. This fact may explain why biogroundind has been used to   improve chronic inflammatory diseases.";Grounding is a potentially effective, accessible, and low-cost therapeutic tool for combating oxidative stress and improving pain and inflammatory diseases. The most accepted hypothesis suggests that direct or indirect contact with the Earth's surface enables the capture of free electrons, which interact with reactive species (oxidants), preventing the formation of free radicals and acting as antioxidants.;"Oxidative Stress; Grounding; Earthing; Inflammation"

However, there is a lack of supporting clinical evidence to determine the impact of syndrome differentiation on the efficacy of acupuncture treatment. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the importance of point selection based on syndrome differentiation by re-analyzing the trials' results in treating primary insomnia with acupuncture.;"We systematically searched 9 databases for eligible trials. Two authors extracted data independently from citations, interventions, and outcomes. Since the ""treatment acupuncture"" and ""control acupuncture"" data compared in this study were from different trials, we matched the data in a 1:1 ratio and minimized heterogeneity between the paired groups. Matching factors included age, sex ratio, and the baseline Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score. Meta-analyses were performed using Revman 5.4 software. Effect estimation presented continuous data with a mean difference (MD) with a 95% confidence interval (CI). Besides the recombination indirect comparison, STATA 15.0 was used for network meta-analysis of all included trials.";We included a total of 172 trials. After matching, 19 recombinational studies were established. Meta-analysis showed that PSQI scores in the syndrome differentiation group were slightly lower than the non-syndrome differentiation group (MD=-1.98, 95%CI [-3.52, -0.44], P=0.01). Network meta-analysis of all included trials showed no statistical difference in acupoints selection between syndrome and non-syndrome differentiation (MD=-0.12, 95% CI [-3.85, 3.62]). However, acupoint selection based on syndrome differentiation (72.6%) ranks higher than acupoint selection based on non-syndrome differentiation (57.2%) according to SUCRA curves. Limitations included high heterogeneity from indirect comparisons and bias risks in original trials. Previous studies reported inconsistent results, potentially due to conflicts between standardized trial designs and individualized SD principles. Future research should adopt adaptive trial designs (e.g., sequential multiple-assignment RCTs) to better evaluate dynamic acupuncture protocols while balancing methodological rigor and clinical authenticity.;After matching recombination and network meta-analysis, we found a minor statistical difference in acupoints selection between syndrome and non-syndrome differentiation in the treatment of insomnia. However, due to the higher risk of bias in indirect comparisons and the insignificant clinical significance of the effect values indicating between-group differences, existing evidence has not yet shown that acupuncture based on syndrome differentiation is more effective in treating insomnia than non-syndrome differentiation.;"Matching recombination; indirect comparison; network meta-analysis; syndrome differentiation; randomized controlled trials"

The effect estimation is represented by continuous data, which indicates the mean difference (MD) in the PSQI scores, along with a 95% confidence interval (CI).";The study included 157 trials. Direct comparison showed high-frequency acupuncture (5 times per week) significantly improved PSQI scores compared to low-frequency (3 times per week) (MD=-1.46, 95%CI -2.14 to -0.78). However, paired analysis did not found difference between acupuncture frequency in treating insomniaS according to PSQI scores (MD=0.2, 95%CI -0.77 to 1.17), similar results were found in network meta-analysis (MD = -1.46, 95%CI -4.84 to 1.92). This study found no significant difference in efficacy for primary insomnia between acupuncture frequencies of ?3 versus ?4 weekly sessions, aligning with prior relevant research but contrasting pain-related conditions where higher frequency often enhances outcomes. While matching methods and network meta-analysis strengthened comparability, evidence certainty remains limited by potential confounding factors and insufficient treatment duration in some trials. Future studies should prioritize dose-effect designs for frequency-sensitive conditions like chronic pain disorders. Clinically, practitioners may tailor acupuncture frequency to individual needs without compromising efficacy, supporting flexible treatment personalization for insomnia.;The results of the matched studies and network meta-analysis suggest that there may be no difference in the efficacy of acupuncture between those treated with a frequency of ?3 times per week and those treated with a frequency of ?4 times per week for primary insomnia.;"Treatment frequency; acupuncture; primary insomnia; randomized controlled trials; network meta-analysis"

Secondary data from the Hospital Admission System were analyzed to assess respiratory health outcomes in both Indigenous and non-Indigenous populations. Monthly remote sensing data on particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5) were classified according to the WHO air quality standards. Generalized Mixed Effects Models, with a negative binomial error distribution, were fitted using RStudio Version 2023.12.0+369 and the glmmTMB package. Statitiscal Wald Test was applied followed by overall rates. This analysis assessed the impact of PM2.5 exposure on respiratory outcomes, adjusting for regional variations and potential confounders in 580 cities. Spatial images capturing wildfires and deforestation were used to illustrate anthropogenic actions over time. Ethics committee approval was not required as the study used publicly available and secondary data. This study investigates the impact of wildfire exposure, as measured by PM2.5, on respiratory diseases among Indigenous populations in the Brazilian Amazon from 2010 to 2018.;The analysis showed clear seasonal patterns affecting PM2.5 levels and respiratory diseases in the Brazilian Amazon. PM2.5 concentrations peak towards the end of the year, same period as the dry season marked by a significant drop in rainfall from June to September. Rainfall at the beginning of the year is high but decreases sharply mid-year, with an exceptional rainfall peak recorded in 2011. Minimum temperatures drop notably in June and July, typically ranging between 18°C and 22°C, except for 2018, which showed higher temperatures throughout most of the year. Respiratory disease cases peak around mid-year, slightly lagging behind PM2.5 peaks. Data gaps, especially in 2019 due to over 50% missing data in fire-affected regions like Pará and Amazonas, highlight challenges in monitoring. Overall, PM2.5 levels during wildfire seasons exceed WHO guidelines, disproportionately impacting Indigenous communities and stressing the need for improved environmental and public health policies.;The study highlights a strong connection between prolonged exposure to PM2.5 and respiratory diseases in Indigenous communities, reflecting the severe environmental degradation in the Amazon and the limited effectiveness of Brazil’s current wildfire and conservation policies. It underscores the urgent need for targeted public health interventions and stronger national and international actions to reduce pollution, deforestation, and climate impacts. ;"respiratory diseases; Indigenous health; climate change; Amazonian forest; "

In this context, non-pharmacological strategies stand out as viable and safe alternatives, among them Auriculotherapy (A) and Flower Therapy (FT). The objective of this study was to analyze the efficacy of auriculotherapy and flower therapy in managing anxiety and promoting and maintaining sleep quality among university students at a public university in Brazil.;This is a preliminary analysis of a randomized clinical trial with a crossover design, conducted with university students symptomatic for anxiety and sleep quality alterations, evaluated through the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Participants were randomly assigned to two groups: the A/FT group initially received auriculotherapy followed by flower therapy, while the FT/A group initially received flower therapy followed by auriculotherapy. Each intervention lasted four weeks, totaling eight weeks of follow-up. Data were analyzed statistically using linear regression via generalized linear models to assess the presence of a carry-over effect. When a carry-over effect was observed, comparisons between groups were conducted considering only the first evaluation period using the Mann-Whitney test. In cases where no carry-over effect was detected, mixed-effects linear models were used for group comparisons.;"A total of 45 students participated. Results indicated intragroup reductions in anxiety scores and improvements in sleep quality. In the A/FT group, PSQI scores varied from 7.45 to 6.18; STAI-state scores from 49.09 to 46.73; and STAI-trait scores from 46.27 to 46.18. In the FT/A group, PSQI scores varied from 6.10 to 6.00; STAI-state from 48.50 to 42.60; and STAI-trait from 43.00 to 40.20. The carry-over effect was statistically significant only for the STAI-trait (p = 0.0215). Direct comparisons between groups, however, did not show statistical significance.
";"In conclusion, the preliminary results suggest that both interventions were well tolerated, with no reports of adverse events, indicating good safety. Improvements in the measured outcomes were observed within groups, particularly in the group that started with Flower Therapy. However, the absence of statistical significance between groups, the presence of a carry-over effect, and the lack of effect size measures limit the interpretation of clinical efficacy. Thus, although the findings are promising, it is not possible to affirm the conclusive effectiveness of the interventions. Future studies with larger samples, control of residual effects, and clinical relevance analysis are recommended to deepen the understanding of the effects of these integrative practices on the mental health of university students.

The nursing profession, marked by its high demands and specialized requirements, poses a significant risk for the development of physical and mental health disorders among its practitioners. Mood serves as an indicator of overall psychological well-being, with positive mood states being linked to favorable health outcomes in both physical and mental health domains. The study aims to compare the effectiveness of Bach flower therapy with a placebo in improving mood states among stressed nursing workers. ;"Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pragmatic clinical trial. The sample consisted of 75 nursing professionals working in primary healthcare centers in São Paulo, Brazil. Data were collected via electronic form using a clinical sociodemographic questionnaire, and the Brunel Mood Scale (BRUMS). The Experimental group received a standardized formula containing the essences Cherry Plum, Elm, Hornbeam, Olive, Star of Bethlehem, Walnut, and White Chestnut, diluted in a 30% alcoholic vehicle; the Placebo group received only the 30% alcoholic diluent. Participants were instructed to intake four drops of the bottle’s content, four times a day, for four weeks. The study was approved by a research ethics committee. ";"Paired samples T-tests showed statistically significant results (p < 0.05) in both groups for mood states pre- and post-treatment. However, Cohen’s d effect size was more prominent in the Experimental group, in the following domains: Depression – Experimental, d = -0.79 (medium); Placebo, d = -0.42 (small). Confusion – Experimental, d = -0.45 (small); Placebo, d = -0.18 (trivial); Anger – Experimental, d = -0.56 (medium); Placebo, d = -0.38 (small).  The utilization of a standardized formula, combined with the relatively short intervention duration, may have been a limiting factor in achieving optimal outcomes. The positive outcomes observed in this study can be attributed to the therapeutic effects of specific flower essences, namely: White Chestnut, for Confusion; Cherry Plum, for Anger; and Star of Bethlehem, for Depression. The Walnut essence helps maintain emotional stability and personal autonomy, being indicated for people whose emotional states are subject to external influences.";Although both Experimental and Placebo groups showed similar effects on mood states, Bach flower therapy demonstrated a slightly better effect size in Confusion, Anger, and Depression domains, compared to the placebo.;"Affect; Pragmatic Clinical Trial; Flower Essences; Nursing; Primary Health Care"

Considering the growing impact of economic instability on emotional balance, this study aimed to reflect on the perceptions of well-being reported by individuals experiencing financial insecurity, based on clinical practice using the Saint Germain flower essences: Abundância, Boa Deusa, Boa Sorte, Canela, Chapéu de Sol, Lírio da Paz, Patiens, Populus Panicum, São Miguel, Tuia, Lótus Azul, and Poaia Rosa.;"The clinical follow-up took place between 2016 and 2019, involving 40 participants (n=20 in Brazil and n=20 in England), organized into three evaluation stages. Initially, a formula containing ten Saint Germain flower essences was administered: Abundância, Boa Deusa, Boa Sorte, Canela, Chapéu de Sol, Lírio da Paz, Patiens, Populus Panicum, São Miguel, and Tuia. After three months of continuous use, participants began using a new combination with Abundância, Boa Sorte, Lótus Azul, Patiens, and Poaia Rosa. The second evaluation was conducted at the end of six months of floral intervention. Two years after the beginning of the process, a third follow-up was carried out to assess the persistence of the reported perceptions. Data were organized in Excel spreadsheets, based on participants’ narratives collected through an author-developed clinical instrument applied at all stages of the therapeutic journey.
Inclusion criteria considered adults reporting emotional distress associated with financial instability, such as indebtedness, professional insecurity, and difficulty in financial planning. Descriptive analysis of the data revealed subjective reports of improved emotional balance, reorganization of daily routines, and increased coping capacity, in both the Brazilian and British contexts, despite sociocultural differences.
The study followed the ethical principles established by Resolution No. 466/12 of the Brazilian National Health Council. All participants voluntarily signed the Informed Consent Form (TCLE).
";"The results indicated significant improvement in emotional indicators in both countries. In Brazil, participants reported constant fear, feelings of powerlessness, and difficulties in financial management. In England, amidst the uncertainties of Brexit, they mentioned professional insecurity, family tensions, and decision-making blocks. After continuous use of the flower essences, greater emotional stability, reorganization of routines, and improved coping skills were observed.
";"Despite cultural and economic differences, emotional patterns showed similarities between the groups, suggesting that the Saint Germain flower essences may act on universal cores of imbalance related to insecurity and financial instability. Future studies with more robust designs, validated instruments, and larger samples are recommended to deepen the investigation of the mechanisms of action of the Saint Germain flower essences in promoting emotional balance and to strengthen their scientific basis.

Tuina therapy (Tuina) is commonly utilized for managing knee osteoarthritis (KOA), yet the available evidence is limited. To evaluate the effectiveness of Tuina compared to widely-accepted manual physical therapy (mPT) for patients with KOA.;Between Oct 2019 and Oct 2021, patients with KOA (Kellgren-Lawrence score II or III) were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive Tuina or mPT, with eight 20-minute sessions over 3 weeks. Assessments were performed at baseline, week 4, 8, and 16. The primary outcome was the change of total Western Ontario and McMaster University Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) from baseline to week 4. Secondary outcomes included WOMAC subscales, knee pain measures, performance-based tests, quality-of-life measures, and safety assessments. Patients, evaluators, and statisticians were blinded to treatment group assignment. All main analyses were by intention-to-treat.  ;"Of the 140 patients allocated to Tuina or mPT, 127 completed the treatment. There was significant intervention

They are composed of traditional Chinese herbs such as Acanthopanax, Qingmengshi, and Fritillaria. In Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), DQG is used to treat manic-type schizophrenia, especially when strong sedatives are ineffective. We conducted this study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of DQG as an adjunct to risperidone for negative symptoms of schizophrenia and its effect on improving Phlegm-Dampness Obstruction (PDO) syndrome.;"Methods: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in China. A total of 134 patients aged 18-70, meeting International Classification of Diseases, 11th Revision (ICD-11) criteria for schizophrenia and TCM criteria for PDO syndrome, were enrolled. After a washout period, participants were randomized to receive either DQG (10g BID) plus risperidone (1mg BID) or placebo plus risperidone for 6 weeks. Blinding was maintained for patients, investigators, and outcome assessors. The primary outcome was the change in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score from baseline to week 6. Secondary outcomes included PANSS negative scores, TCM symptom scores, and safety assessments. 
Analyses included Intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis, Per-Protocol Set (PPS), and Safety Set (SS). ITT was used as the primary analysis and PPS as the sensitivity analysis. Descriptive statistics included mean, standard deviation, median, interquartile range, frequency, and count. Group comparisons were conducted using t-tests, Wilcoxon rank-sum tests, chi-square tests, or Fisher's exact test. Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) were used for repeated measures analysis. 
";Of the 134 randomized patients, 126 completed the trial, with a dropout rate of 5.97%. Baseline characteristics were comparable between groups. By week 6, the ITT analysis showed a significantly greater reduction in PANSS total score in the intervention group compared to the control group (Median: 45 vs 48, Z=3.8486, P=0.0498). The intervention group also demonstrated significantly greater improvement in PANSS negative score (Median: 14 vs 15, Z=4.8713, P=0.0273) and TCM symptom score (Mean: 23.93 vs 30.13, t=2.85, P=0.0050). No significant difference was found in PANSS positive scores. The GEE analysis revealed significant group (P=0.0004), time (P<0.0001), and group*time interaction (P=0.0078) effects for PANSS total score, indicating a superior and sustained improvement pattern in the intervention group throughout the treatment period (significantly lower scores at weeks 2, 4, and 6, P<0.05). Sensitivity analysis of the PPS dataset confirmed the stability of these results. Both treatments were well tolerated.;DQG combined with low-dose risperidone significantly improved overall psychopathology and negative symptoms, as well as TCM syndrome manifestations, compared to risperidone plus placebo.

According to the symptoms and needs of different severity, there have been relevant stepped intervention clinical pathways in foreign countries, but they may not be applicable to China.;After the core group determined the problems to be solved in this study, extensive evidence was collected, including guidelines, systematic evaluations, etc., and multidisciplinary experts were invited to reach a consensus on the basis of Delphi questionnaires to form this path.;From January 2023 to March 2023, 78 experts were invited, out of which 40 responded and took part in this study, through which a stepped clinical pathway of conservative treatment for LSS with both TCM and Western medicine was constructed. There were four rounds of survey, with 40 questionnaires distributed and recovered in each round. The active coefficient for all four rounds was 100%. The pathway included grading criteria for LSS, stepped treatment to which interventions were matched, outcome evaluation indicators, evaluation interval, criteria for treatment upgrade/downgrade, instructions on some TCM interventions, recommended therapy combinations, as well as the application of some therapies, such as analgesics.;This study fully considers China 's national conditions and the objects of use, and forms a unique step-by-step clinical pathway for conservative treatment of integrated traditional Chinese and Western medicine. It is used for the implementation of basic medical institutions. According to the individual differences of patients, combined with the values and wishes of patients, doctors and patients jointly choose the most appropriate conservative treatment strategy that meets the preferences of patients. The implementation of this clinical pathway in primary healthcare institutions across diverse regions of China also faces several challenges, including uneven technical capabilities, resource shortages, low motivation among healthcare personnel, and poor patient compliance. These barriers can be effectively addressed through pathway-specific training programs, enhanced resource allocation, and strengthened oversight mechanisms, thereby improving the quality and efficiency of primary care services.;"consensus; degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis; conservative treatment; stepped clinical pathway; primary care"

Current management strategies include pharmacological treatments such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and oral contraceptives, which can be associated with adverse effects or inadequate efficacy in some patients. Light therapy has emerged as a promising non-invasive treatment option for various pain-related conditions, potentially offering analgesic effects through mechanisms such as improved blood flow, reduced prostaglandin levels, and smooth muscle relaxation. Despite its potential, the effectiveness of light therapy in alleviating dysmenorrhea remains unclear. This systematic review and meta-analysis aim to assess both the efficacy and safety of light therapy in managing dysmenorrhea.;A comprehensive search was conducted across 12 databases, including PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, Allied and Complementary Medicine Database (AMED), APA PsycINFO, CINAHL Complete, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Chinese Scientific Journals Database (VIP), WanFang Data, Research Information Sharing Service (RISS), and Oriental Medicine Advanced Searching Integrated System (OASIS), for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published until February 2025 that evaluated the effectiveness of light therapy for dysmenorrhea. Inclusion criteria were assessed independently, and inconsistencies were resolved by consensus. Data were extracted on pain intensity, treatment duration, and light therapy parameters. The methodological quality of the included studies was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool version 2 (RoB2). A meta-analysis was performed to estimate the pooled effect size of light therapy on pain reduction using a random-effects model.;"Twelve studies, including nine randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with a total of 645 participants, met the inclusion criteria. Most interventions involved low-level laser therapy (LLLT) (n=6), while others used high-intensity laser therapy (HILT) (n=2) or polarized light (n=1). A meta-analysis of three RCTs found that LLLT significantly reduced pain at 12 weeks compared to a sham treatment (mean difference (MD) = -4.02, 95% CI: -7.21 to -0.82; p = 0.01). LLLT also resulted in significantly greater pain relief than oral contraceptives over the same period (MD = 0.91, 95% CI: 0.49 to 1.33; p < 0.0001).  The risk of bias was concerning in most studies, and adverse effects were minimal and transient. No serious adverse events were reported across the trials.";The findings suggest that light therapy may offer a non-pharmacological alternative for pain management in dysmenorrhea, with minimal side effects. Further well-designed, large-scale randomized controlled trials with standardized light parameters are needed to confirm these findings and determine the optimal treatment protocol for clinical use.;"dysmenorrhea; light therapy; Low-Level Light Therapy; non-pharmacological; pain management"

Fire needle therapy, a traditional Chinese medicine technique, has potential as an alternative therapeutic strategy. However, rigorous evidence on its efficacy is lacking. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of fire needle therapy, alone and combined with topical tacrolimus ointment, for non-segmental stable vitiligo.;In this 6-month randomized self-controlled trial, 35 vitiligo patients were enrolled, providing three similar lesions each. Lesions were randomly allocated to receive fire needle monotherapy, 0.1% tacrolimus ointment monotherapy, or combined fire needle and tacrolimus ointment therapy. Main outcome was change in vitiligo surface area.;In total, 29 patients completed the 6-month follow-up. The combination therapy group showed significantly greater reductions in vitiligo surface area compared to monotherapy groups starting at months 4 and 5. By the end of the study, combination therapy resulted in remarkably higher repigmentation responses, with 89.7% of lesions showing at least mild (?25%) repigmentation and 51.7% showing good (?50%) repigmentation. This significantly exceeded the outcomes with topical tacrolimus ointment alone, which only achieved 6.9% mild response and 6.9% good response.

Importantly, no major adverse events occurred.;"This study provides promising preliminary evidence supporting the use of fire needle therapy, alone or in combination with topical tacrolimus ointment, for inducing repigmentation in non-segmental stable vitiligo. As a non-pharmacological approach, fire needle therapy warrants further study as an alternative vitiligo treatment.

Among individuals with IBS, approximately one-third of patients experience a specific subtype called IBS with constipation (IBS-C). In order to address the gaps in the existing literature and provide evidence-based recommendations for clinical practice, we propose a systematic review and network meta-analysis of pharmacological and non-pharmacological (including traditional, complementary, and integrative medicine (TCIM)) approaches for the management of IBS-C patients. This study aims to synthesize the available evidence, compare the relative effectiveness and safety of various interventions, and identify the most promising strategies for IBS-C management.;This systematic review and network meta-analysis (NMA) follow PRISMA-NMA guidelines and are registered in PROSPERO. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving adults diagnosed with IBS-C using standardized criteria are included. Both pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions are compared against placebo, sham, or active treatments. Primary outcomes and timepoints are defined based on expert input. Searches were performed in PubMed, Cochrane CENTRAL, Embase, and Web of Science. Data extraction and risk of bias assessments were conducted by two independent reviewers. Random-effects models and frequentist NMA were used, with heterogeneity and inconsistency evaluated.;107 RCTs related to IBS-C were identified from databases. These studies evaluated outcomes, including global improvement, quality of life (QoL), stool frequency and consistency, pain severity, bloating, urgency, straining, incomplete evacuation, discomfort, depression, anxiety, and stress. Other outcomes included work productivity, cramping, mucus, treatment satisfaction, recurrence rate, rescue medication use, and the need to defecate without being able to. Among the primary outcomes, 13 studies assessing global IBS-C symptoms using the IBS-SSS scale were included in the NMA. Various treatments such as acupuncture, breathing training, Chinese medicine, and linaclotide were compared against no intervention. The only treatment that showed significant improvement was breathing training, which reduced the total IBS-SSS score compared to no intervention (MD = -116.08, 95% CI: -219.10 to -10.59). Other treatments, including acupuncture, Chinese medicine, and linaclotide, did not show a significant effect on global IBS-C symptoms. For further outcomes, linaclotide showed significant improvement compared to placebo in the response of CSBM (RR = 2.47, 95% CI: 1.76 to 3.48). Additionally, Chinese medicine combined with linaclotide, linaclotide alone, and tenapanor increased the frequency of CSBM per week compared to placebo, whereas treatments like minesapride and PEG plus electrolytes did not. Linaclotide had the highest probability of improving CSBM frequency, followed by Chinese medicine plus linaclotide. Regarding mental health outcomes, no significant differences were found among the treatments for depression or anxiety based on the NMA results.;"This network meta-analysis provides valuable insights into the management of IBS-C, revealing the potential of non-pharmacological interventions such as TCIM approaches. While linaclotide demonstrated effectiveness in improving stool frequency, further clinical research is needed to establish the long-term benefits and optimal integration of TCIM practices into IBS-C treatment.

In this context, auriculotherapy—one of the Integrative and Complementary Health Practices—emerges as a promising intervention for emotional disorders. However, few studies have investigated participants' perceptions regarding the use of this intervention in emotional issues. The aim of this study was to analyze the perceptions of undergraduate and graduate students about the use of auriculotherapy in emotional disorders. ;This is a qualitative study, approved by an ethics committee (approval number: 5.700.107), conducted between August and September 2024. The participants were 23 undergraduate and 11 graduate students from a public higher education institution who had some degree of emotional disorder, assessed by the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21), and who underwent weekly auriculotherapy sessions. The interviews were analyzed using Bardin’s content analysis. ;"Three categories of discussion were established. (I) Benefits of auriculotherapy in relieving emotional symptoms: “(...) I feel less anxious, you’re able to deal with stressful situations better” (P1); “(...) I had many episodes of anxiety, really strong crises (...) it's been quite a while since I last had one, and I started to notice a decrease over time (...)” (E1). (II) Benefits of auriculotherapy in physical symptoms: “(...) I’ve noticed that my performance has improved, my nights of sleep have been better (...)” (P2); “I remember that as soon as I started auriculotherapy, I was able to sleep (...) I feel better physically (...) I feel less tired (...) I wake up more energized” (E2). (III) Satisfaction with auriculotherapy: “(...) These benefits of feeling more comfortable with yourself, I think they’re priceless (...)” (P3); “(...) This experience has shown me that it really makes a difference (...)” (E3).  ";"The participants’ perceptions in this study were that auriculotherapy provides emotional and physical benefits, in addition to improved academic performance, and consequently, increased satisfaction with the use of this intervention.

Starting with the UV-induced photolysis of 7-dehydrocholesterol to pre-vitamin D3 in the skin, the metabolite 25(OH)D3 is synthesized in the liver, and subsequently converted in the kidneys to the active hormone 1,25(OH)2D. To maintain health effects of the ""sunshine-vitamin D3"" in healthy persons, blood serum levels of 25(OH)D3 > 20 ng ml-1 are recommended. In contrast, significant parts of the Western European population suffer from 25(OH)D3 deficiency, as they have serum levels below 15 ng ml-1. It is also known that the effects of oral vitamin D supplementation (cholecalciferol) are limited due to the short degradation times, while endogenously produced 25(OH)D3 concentrations are slowly degraded over several weeks.";"To investigate vitamin D3 synthesis by solar-simulated UV radiation under consideration of current radiation protection guidelines, 20 non-adapted healthy volunteers (8 men, 12 women; skin phototypes I-IV; mean age: 38.6 ± 11.5 years, range: 22-59 years) were exposed to 15 whole-body irradiations for three weeks and up to five times per week during winter. Both spectrum and irradiance were chosen to be similarly with solar exposures at noon-time in summer in central Europe under cloudless skies. Daily doses were firstly limited to 30 % of the individual erythema threshold dose determined in non-adapted skin (MEDi), and increased up to 65 % of the MEDi during the series to compensate UV skin adaptation. The corresponding exposure times for each side of the body were between 7 and 15 minutes. 25(OH)D3 concentrations were measured from blood samples at baseline, and after every fifth irradiation.";"In most subjects, 25(OH)D3 levels increased from baseline deficiency (13.4±7.46 ng ml-1) after completion of the series. The increases varied individually and depended on age. They were greater the lower the baseline concentrations were, but the increases weakened from week to week.
After finishing of the series, the 25(OH)D3 concentrations were 32.4±6.9 ng ml-1 (range: 18-42 ng ml-1) in young and middle-aged persons up to 45 years, and 17.9±9.2 ng ml-1 (range: 8-32 ng ml-1) in elderly individuals aged 49-59 years. However, all subjects spontaneously and consistently reported both an increase in well-being and a feeling of activation after each treatment.";The results demonstrate the potential of sun-simulated, low-dose heliotherapy to induce a sufficient vitamin D3 status lasting over several weeks and to ensure desired preventive and therapeutic effects. However, this method appears particularly suitable for younger individuals. Other modes of action of sun simulated low-dose heliotherapy beyond vitamin D3 may exist that require further investigation, including skin-brain crosstalk through release of hormones that affect the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal axis.;"simulated heliotherapy; low-dose irradiation; vitamin-D3-synthesis; deficient healthy adults; age-dependency"

This pilot study assessed the feasibility and preliminary effectiveness of a co-designed, community-based CR program tailored to Chinese migrants living in Australia. ;"This pilot randomised controlled trial included Chinese migrants in Australia who had undergone stent placement or coronary bypass graft surgery. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to either a CR group or a waitlist control group. The CR program comprised: (1) a virtual shared medical appointment - a single 90-minute group consultation and 30-min individual sessions with a nurse, a dietitian, and a physiotherapist; (2) virtual Tai Chi - 60-minute sessions, twice weekly for 24 weeks; and (3) health education - four semi-personalised weekly messages for 24 weeks. Primary outcomes were feasibility indicators including recruitment rate, retention rate, and safety. Secondary outcomes included cardiometabolic markers, physical capacity (6-minute walk test), self-efficacy, social support, quality of life, psychological wellbeing (DASS-21), physical activity (7-day steps and walking distance) and satisfaction. Assessments were conducted at baseline, week 12 and week 24. Statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS (version 26.0). ";Nineteen participants (31.6% female) were enrolled in the study. No program-related adverse events were reported, and the retention rate was 86%. Compared with the waitlist control, the CR group showed significant improvements over 24 weeks in physical capacity (6-minute walk test (meters), CR group: 571.58±70.65 and waitlist group: 446.59±131.45, respectively, p=0.041), physical activity (7-day walking distance (kilometers), 51.22±16.77 and 27.76±9.39, respectively, p=0.01), and psychological wellbeing, including depression (DASS-21 depression score: 15.84 [95%CI 9.68 to 21.99] and 21.50 [95%CI 15.39 to 27.61], respectively, p=0.017), anxiety (DASS-21 anxiety score: 16.57 [95%CI 11.02 to 22.12] and 20.25 [95%CI 14.68 to 25.82], respectively, p=0.006), and overall distress (DASS-21 total score, 51.50 [33.12 to 69.88] and 63.50 [45.21 to 81.79], respectively, p=0.017). No statistically significant differences were observed at 24 weeks in other secondary outcomes. ;A culturally tailored, community-based CR program is feasible, safe, and potentially effective in improving physical fitness, physical activity, and psychological wellbeing among Chinese migrants in Australia. A larger, fully powered randomised trial is warranted to confirm these findings. ;"Tai Ji; coronary disease; randomised controlled trial; mental health; physical fitness"

Psychological factors such as stress, anxiety, and depression are increasingly recognised as modifiable cardiovascular risk factors, yet they are frequently underdiagnosed and undertreated. Tai Chi, a mind-body exercise, may offer potential physical and psychological benefits for this population. This study aimed to evaluate the effects and safety of a standardised Tai Chi intervention on psychological distress and cardiovascular function in individuals with CHD and/or hypertension.;In this randomised clinical trial, 120 adults aged ?40 years with CHD and/or hypertension were randomly assigned (1:1 ratio) to either a Tai Chi intervention or a waitlist control group. The Tai Chi group participated in a standardised 24-week program, consisting of two-hour sessions twice weekly for the first12 weeks, followed by once-weekly sessions for the remaining 12 weeks. The primary outcome was perceived stress, measured by the Perceived Stress Scale-10 (PSS-10). Secondary outcomes included anxiety (Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale), depression (Beck Depression Inventory-II), cardiovascular function (blood pressure, heart rate, heart rate variability, lipid and glucose profiles, and C-reactive protein), quality of life (SF-36) and physical fitness (6-Minute Walk test). Assessments were conducted at baseline, week 12, and week 24.;"Using a linear mixed model, the Tai Chi group showed a statistically greater reduction in PSS-10 mean scores (95% CI) at week 12 than the waitlist control (10.38 [8.81 to 11.97] and 12.46 [10.85 to 14.07], respectively; p=0.006), though the differences were not statistically significant at week 24 (10.44 [8.86 to 12.03] and 11.71 [10.08 to 13.34], respectively; p=0.077). Statistically and clinically significant improvement of physical fitness in the Tai Chi group compared with the waitlist group were found at 12 weeks (558.41 [533.48 to 583.34] and 513.59 [488.59 to 538.58]; p<0.001) and 24 weeks (552.81 [528.17 to 577.44] and 519.63 [494.42 to 544.84], respectively; p=0.002). Between-group differences were also observed in depression, diastolic blood pressure, and quality of life, but not in the remaining secondary outcomes. The attendance rate was 82.5%. No severe Tai Chi-related adverse events were reported.";"Conclusions: A 24-week standardised Tai Chi program appears to be safe and feasible intervention that may improve perceived stress and selected cardiovascular and psychological outcomes in individuals with CHD and/or hypertension.

Research has shown that music can be an effective non-pharmacological technique to reduce pain and anxiety, promoting relaxation and speeding up recovery. In Brazil, the use of music is considered and regulated as an Integrative and Complementary Health Practice (PICS). This study aimed to evaluate the effect of music on pain levels and changes in vital signs in patients during bed baths in the immediate postoperative period following heart surgery.;A randomized controlled trial (RCT), double-blind, was conducted in a Cardiac Intensive Care Unit of a private hospital in Natal, Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil, following the CONSORT guidelines. The study involved 38 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery in the immediate postoperative period. The patients were divided into two groups: a control group - CG (headphones without music) and an experimental group - EG (headphones with the patient's preferred music). Pain levels were assessed using the Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) and the Wong-Baker FACES Scale (WBS), applied during and after the intervention. The study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee (CAAE: 11745419.6.0000.5292) and registered in the Brazilian Registry of Clinical Trials (RBR-69w6f5z).;The patients were allocated as follows: 21 in the CG and 17 in the SG. There were no differences between the groups with regard to sociodemographic, clinical and surgical data.  In the experimental group, the ANOVA test for the study variables, with a significance level of 5%, indicated statistically significant differences regarding Heart Rate (mean before the intervention of 92.53 [SD: 11.98] and mean after the intervention of 88.82 [SD: 12.79], p = 0.019). In this same group, there was a statistically significant difference in pain, with a mean on the NRS scale before the intervention of 3.29 [SD: 3.14] and after the intervention of 0.88 [SD: 1.41], p = 0.001, and on the WBS scale (mean before the intervention of 2.82 [SD: 1.88] and after the intervention of 0.71 [SD: 1.21], p < 0.001). In the control group, no significant differences were observed in vital signs, NRS (p = 0.062), and WBS (p = 0.158). The results corroborate with the literature showing that music therapy is effective in reducing post-operative pain and anxiety by alleviating pain and lowering heart rate without causing side effects. Nursing plays an essential role in pain management and can incorporate music therapy as a supplementary tool in patient care, particularly during post-operative baths. This study suggests that music can be a valuable strategy to complement drug treatment.;This study found that playing music during bed baths reduced pain levels in the immediate postoperative period of coronary artery bypass graft surgery. Future research should explore the combination of music with other complementary therapies and assess the perceptions of both patients and professionals regarding its effectiveness in different contexts and groups.;"Thoracic Surgery; Pain; Music Therapy; Nursing Care"

It is characterized by physical and psychological signs and symptoms, such as anxiety and cravings, the latter being an intense desire to consume alcohol. Integrative and complementary practices, such as the use of Bach Flowers, may alleviate the most intense symptoms of this condition. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of Bach Flowers in Alcohol Abstinence Syndrome anxiety and cravings levels.;Bach Flower Remedies, developed by Edward Bach, are integrative therapies using wildflower extracts to promote emotional balance by acting on subtle energy fields. A randomized double-blind clinical trial was conducted at the Psychosocial Care Center for Alcohol and Other Drugs III in Paraíba, Brazil. Thirty-six participants were randomly assigned to experimental (Bach Flower) and control (placebo) groups. The remedy was diluted in water and administered orally: four drops, four times a day, for five days. Amber bottles and blinded administration by a researcher unaware of group assignments ensured blinding. Data collection involved sociodemographic and clinical instruments: the Revised Clinical Assessment of Abstinence, the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (IDATE), and the Brazilian version of the Alcohol Craving Questionnaire – Short Form – Revised (ACQ-SR). In the ACQ-SR, factor 1 related to craving from positive and negative alcohol-related reinforcement, and factor 2 to the intention to consume alcohol for pleasure. Assessments occurred before and five days after the flower essence application. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee (CAAE 61762022.1.0000.5537) and registered in the Brazilian Registry of Clinical Trials (RBR-7pzb4sw).;Using the Student's t-test, in individuals who received BFRs (EG), the State-IDATE score decreased from a mean of 59.1 to 39.0 (SD: 12.0-10.2), p < 0.001, and the Trait-IDATE score decreased from a mean of 61.39 to 52.94 (SD: 8.71-8.75), p < 0.001. The mean ACQ-SR Factor 1 decreased from 45.17 to 15.56 (SD: 8.73-7.29), p < 0.001, showing a shift from severe to mild craving. Effect sizes were large for State-IDATE (1.61), Trait-IDATE (1.27), ACQ-SR Factor 1 (3.76), and global ACQ-SR (3.70). ACQ-SR Factor 2 showed a medium effect size (0.55), increasing from a mean of 12.83 to 15.67 (SD: 4.03-3.82), p = 0.033, indicating reduced intention to consume alcohol for pleasure. In the CG, no statistical differences were found in State-IDATE (p = 0.441), Trait-IDATE (p = 0.896), ACQ-SR Factor 1 (p = 0.238), or Factor 2 (p = 0.469). Assessment of anxiety and craving, along with therapies that reduce the desire for alcohol, are essential to minimize relapses and prevent both clinical and emotional deterioration. Integrative and Complementary Practices (ICPs) can significantly contribute to the Psychosocial Care Network (RAPS) by providing therapeutic support for users and treatment teams. These practices are low-cost and non-invasive, making them an effective strategy to incorporate into intervention and treatment of alcohol users.;This research suggests that Bach Flowers Remedies can reduce anxiety, both as a trait and a temporary state, as well as reduce cravings, as assessed through the ACQ-SR index.;"Complementary Therapies; Floral Therapy; Substance Withdrawal Syndrome; Nursing"

Auriculotherapy and Foot Reflexology are non-pharmacological integrative practices that, through the stimulation of nerve endings in the areas of the ear and feet, respectively, promote health and well-being by reducing pain symptoms. This study analyzed the meanings that emerged from a group of chronic pain sufferers participating in an academic extension project, based on their experience with Auriculotherapy and Foot Reflexology. ;This is a case study research, with analysis made through a focus group conducted with eight of the thirty participants, after twelve weeks receiving care with protocols of both techniques, performed successively, being the Foot Reflexology session lasting 45 minutes, twice a week, for 6 weeks, and Auriculotherapy once a week, both using a protocol of points related to chronic pain complaints. Data analysis took place from a qualitative and quantitative perspective, using the Iramuteq software, which classified the words extracted from the focus group based on text segments from the textual corpus, allowing us to understand the users' perspective on the experiences in the two types of integrative practice. ;Regarding the effects perceived in Reflexology, relaxation and reduced anxiety stood out, and these perceptions were related to a greater understanding of the body. Improved sleep was the highlight of Auriculotherapy, which was associated with the perception of improved functionality. ;The good acceptance and recognition by the user of the improvement of chronic pain symptoms through non-invasive practices that are also low cost, indicates that such techniques should be considered in the context of public health services and also in professional health training institutions.;"health promotion; Complementary Therapies; Chronic Pain; Reflexotherapy; Auriculotherapy"

Although controversial, homeopathy is globally used and integrated into Brazil's public health system. A growing body of physicochemical research and a recent systematic review of placebo-controlled meta-analyses indicate specific effects of homeopathic preparations, warranting further investigation.  We are conducting ten N-of-1 trials to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of classical homeopathy in MDD. An N-of-1 trial is a randomized, double-blind, controlled, multiple-period crossover study conducted on a single patient. This study presents the initial findings from the first completed participant. We hypothesized that personalized homeopathic treatment would yield clinically significant differences compared to placebo in MDD patients. Additionally, we conducted a physicochemical analysis of the fifty-millesimal (LM) potencies of the individualized homeopathic medicine Sulphur used for the patient, alongside plasma proteomic analysis.;A 28-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover trial assessed Sulphur LM4-7 effectiveness and safety in a 45-year-old female with MDD. The primary outcomes were Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) scores, and secondary outcomes included SF-12 and Clinical Global Impression Scale scores. We conducted Plasma proteomics and physicochemical analyses (SEM, DLS, ICP-MS) of Sulphur LM2-7;During the open-label run-in phase, the patient demonstrated marked improvements across multiple domains, including a significant reduction in depressive symptoms (BDI-II scores decreased from 32 to 5). In the N-of-1 trial BDI-II scores increased significantly in the placebo group (P=0.017), whereas no significant change was observed in the Sulphur-treated group (P=0.243). Overall symptom improvement with homeopathy compared to placebo, controlling for baseline, was 78% (p<0.05). MCS-12 significantly decreased during placebo (P=0.008) but remained stable during homeopathic treatment (P=0.542). No significant PCS-12 changes were observed (P>0.2). CGI-I scores improved during the run-in treatment but showed no further change during the N-of-1 trial. Sulfur-loaded LM formulations presented nanoparticles, as confirmed by SEM analysis, demonstrated distinct particle size characteristics via DLS, and exhibited quantifiable sulfur concentrations detected through ICP-MS. Proteomic analysis suggested that Sulphur treatment modulates immune response pathways, highlighting a potential mechanism underlying its antidepressant-like effects.;This personalized integrative homeopathic protocol demonstrated superior effectiveness to placebo in the studied individual. The physicochemical characteristics and proteomic findings indicate potential immunomodulatory effects mediated by nanomedicine mechanisms. However, further research involving larger cohorts is warranted to confirm these preliminary observations.;"Depression; Homeopathy N-of-1 studies; Translational Research Nanomedicine; Proteomics ICP-MS; Antidepressant Deprescription"

CIH students may adopt unique habits shaped by their education, which emphasizes lifestyle medicine, natural health products (NHPs), and mind-body practices. This study characterizes the dietary and self-care practices among CIH students and their well-being outcomes.;This secondary analysis uses data from the International Cohort of Lifestyle and Dietary Health (INCLD-Health) Study. Biological, dietary, lifestyle, mental, and physical health measures were collected from 190 CIH students at the National University of Natural Medicine (NUNM) in Portland, Oregon. Descriptive statistical analyses summarized diet, nutrition, physical activity, and mental health data.;Among CIH students, 86% regularly used NHPs, with vitamin D, B vitamins, and omega-3 fatty acids being most common. The cohort primarily consumed whole grains, fruits, vegetables, nuts, and non-fried fish, with a mean daily intake of 1646 calories and above-average fiber consumption at 27.2g. Stress levels among CIH students were generally lower, with 37.1% reporting low stress, 58.3% moderate stress, and 4.6% high perceived stress, as measured by the Perceived Stress Scale.;CIH students appear to engage in higher rates of certain health practices, such as regular use of NHPs, healthy dietary habits, and mindfulness-based activities. This may reflect the emphasis on nutrition, NHP education, and preventative lifestyle modifications within CIH programs. ;"complementary and integrative health (CIH); health behaviors; student well-being"

Telomeres length (TL) has been emerging as a potential biomarker of aging. The phenomenon of age-related telomeres shortening is complex and biological mechanisms underlying this process are not yet definitively established. Shorter than the average TL for a specific age group, has been associated with increased incidence of age-related diseases. Our previous studies showed that Mindfulness practices with Tao Calligraphy can improve Depression, Pain and positively affect well-being.";"Materials and Method:
Pilot study investigated effect of mindfulness with tracing calligraphy daily for 2 hours a day for 9 months in 6 women and 6 men, age >60, who also received a subtle energy transmission at the beginning of the study. The subjects continued other mindfulness practices of their choice. The FISH flow cytometry (FC) TL measurement and Quality of Life Questionnaire SF-36 were completed at the start of the study, at 3 months and at 9 months.

Results indicate that mindfulness practices using Tao Calligraphy tracing have significantly increased TL in Granulocytes in 3 month; and they significantly improved the quality of life for participants on the SF-36 scale in 5 categories in 9 months. Observed positive trend in TL over 3 month in Granulocytes only, could be attributed to much faster cell cycles in Granulocytes then in Lymphocytes. The other reason for lack of more significant TL increase could be the small size of the cohort, the measurement method (TL rather than the commonly used telomerase activity measurement and the use of Flow Cytometry rather then Molecular tests); age of participants (previously reported TL increase with statistical significance in the subset of younger meditators, but not the older subset); lifestyle of study subjects who were long-term meditators where the effect on TL and QLQ may have already manifested over the year.";"Tao Calligraphy; Mindfulness; SF-36; Telomere"

The International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP 2020) defines chronic pain as a distressful sensation linked to tissue harm, persisting for over three months. To cope with pain, PLHAs utilize a range of approaches, including standard medical care, alternative healing methods, and body-mind practices. To begin to address this gap, our research project will employ community-based research methods to better inform the pain research and service delivery sectors with the following objectives: 1) create, educate and assist a team of peer researchers for collaborative study involvement, 2) conduct a bilingual survey of HIV-positive PLHA’s who self-identify as living with chronic pain in Canada, and 3) Apply Q-sorting to priotize survey data based on critical needs of those with pain and HIV.;"An exploratory sequential design mixed-methods approach was adopted to achieve goals inherent in community-based research. Aim 1: community engagement, peer training; Aim 2: recruit up to 500 Canadian PLHAs, aged 18 or older, fluent in English or French, and self-identify as living with chronic pain as defined by the IASP (pain for more than 3 months). Outcome measures: Presence of neuropathic pain, Pain severity, Pain-related beliefs and coping, Chronic pain acceptance, Emotional well-being, Social aspects (e.g., disruption associated with HIV, chronic pain, and stigma), Pain treatments including medications, physical and psychological modalities, and Complementary and Integrative Health (CIH) modalities, Sociodemographics, Clinical compassion ,  Sense of coherence; Aim 3 : Q sort with 6 or more unique groups (online, in person). Here we report on findings from Aim 2.";A total of 244 individuals completed the survey (63% identifying as male, mean age: 48).  Half of respondents report having access to a family doctor, 37 % report having low income (37%), or on disability (19%). More than 50% report a substance use disorder, many had stable CD4+ count (42%), ~25% used cannabis daily, and 59% report not having a partner to provide support. Common themes as to approaches for addressing pain include avoidance and isolation, physical activities, substance use, hobbies and creative outlets, use of pain medication, the effects of emotional and lifecourse struggles, and faith/spiritual practices. Respondents offered important feedback on what they believe health care providers should know such as: appreciation for their care and dedication, the need for a wider variety of options for pain management, the importance of addressing accessibility, the need for increased empathy, and that many feel frustrated with issues like judgement and delays as part of their healthcare.;PLHA’s have a broad range of experiences with chronic pain that suggest a need for further research and implementation efforts in the delivery of healthcare services.;"Chronic Pain; community based research; complementary and integrative health (CIH); HIV/AIDS"

Food and catering services represent an effective lever for reducing food waste, as large quantities of food are prepared, served but also discarded every day. Especially within hospitals, catering and related waste substantially contribute to hospitals’ overall emissions. The University Hospital Essen has therefore implemented seven measures to reduce its food waste in patient catering. A sustainability assessment was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness and resource efficiency of the measures.;"Over six months, the University Hospital Essen implemented seven food waste reduction measures. These comprised 1) measuring and analyzing food waste; 2) regular strategic meetings; 3) training dietitians; 4) reducing the portion size of spreadable fat; 5) removing yoghurts from admission meals; 6) reducing soup- and sauce production; and 7) increasing freezing of overproduced foods. Food waste was measured before and after the intervention, over a four-week period each. The implementations’ effectiveness was assessed by comparing food waste savings before and after the intervention. For resource efficiency, benefit-cost ratios were calculated. Additionally, a qualitative assessment examined the implementation effort, longevity and transferability of each measure.";After six months, food waste was reduced by 19 % (?26,500 kg), equivalent to 35 g less food waste per meal for about 1,400 patients receiving three meals daily. The intervention was therefore effective in reducing food waste. The reduction translated into savings of 90,159 euros, 43,557 kg CO2e and approx. 24 million kcal saved. The benefit-cost analysis showed that each euro invested resulted in savings of 1.62 kg of food waste, 1,482 kcal, 2.67 kg CO? equivalents, and 6.53 euros. Most food waste came from plate waste, mainly due to poor discharge management and ward-kitchen communication, leading to meals being prepared for patients who were no longer present. Reducing the amount of spreadable fat, however, was especially effective in reducing food waste, requiring minimal effort. Due to additional workload in daily work activities, measuring food waste needed high effort. All other measures required low implementation effort and were highly transferable, long-lasting and sustainable.;The intervention demonstrated that targeted measures are effective in reducing food waste in hospital catering, with both environmental and economic benefits. An enhanced discharge management and communication system are recommended to further reduce food waste and improve efficiency in patient catering.;"Planetary Health; food waste; patient catering"

These conditions are chronic and management is lifelong. Older age is a risk factor, but arthritis can occur at any age, impacting whole-person wellbeing and quality of life. Yoga is a mind-body practice that includes movement, breathwork, mindfulness, relaxation, applied philosophy and lifestyle. Yoga's whole-person approach has the potential to improve arthritis management in conjunction with established pharmacological and surgical interventions. While the use of yoga has been studied for safety, feasibility and effectiveness in multiple arthritic conditions, no review has gathered that evidence across diagnoses and the lifespan. This review includes a summary of evidence for yoga's role in arthritis management from children to elderly adults.;"The PubMed Central database through the United States National Library of Medicine was searched for relevant indexed literature using the terms ""yoga"" AND (arthritis OR rheum*) with the ""clinical trials"" filter applied.

Additional searches were conducted with the terms ""juvenile"" and ""elderly"" added and ""clinical trial"" removed to ensure the capture of studies at both ends of the lifespan. Studies were assessed for markers of rigor, including sample size, study design, comparison group and reporting quality.";"Thirty-nine manuscripts were identified as relevant with 11 eliminated as a study protocol or secondary analysis. The remaining 28 manuscripts were published by research teams in Australia, Canada, Croatia, India, New Zealand, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and the United States. Thirty-nine percent included patients with osteoarthritis OA; 36% were in rheumatoid arthritis, with the remaining few focused on ankylosing spondylitis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, or multiple arthritis diagnoses. Regarding age and gender, 75% of studies included adults in general with two of those recruiting women only. Two studies targeted older adults, two were for young adults (one of only young women), two were with adolescents, and one included both adults and children. Twenty of the 28 studies were randomized controlled trials (RCTs), with five identified as pilot RCTs. Five studies were non-randomized single group pilot studies and the remaining two included case-control and case study. Common comparators were exercise and usual care. Almost half used an 8-week intervention with durations ranging 1-3 months and frequency of practice between daily and weekly with thrice per week as most common. Styles of yoga were diverse, including hatha yoga, chair yoga, teleyoga, Iyengar-based, Integral-based, biomechanically-based, relaxation-based, Raj Yoga, and more. Common outcomes included pain, physical function, disability and quality of life with some reporting only feasibility outcomes. Most reported significant improvements in yoga users and about half found significant differences between groups with no serious related adverse events.";Yoga appears safe for arthritis patients and may improve clinical outcomes across the lifespan.

These strategies, while not explicitly acknowledging the T&CM workforce, align with T&CM principles including universal health coverage, improving wellbeing, disease prevention and multidisciplinary, person-centred care.";"This mixed-methods, multi-phased cross-sectional study is guided by a health policy and systems research approach. Reported are two components: a nationwide survey of adults in Australia and semi-structured interviews with general practitioners (GPs) and practice nurses. The online questionnaire collected demographic data, personal T&CM use, and opinions about T&CM practitioners’ role in Australian healthcare. It included multiple-choice and free-text responses, with specific sections for medical/allied practitioners, T&CM practitioners, other health-related workforce (academic, administrative, policy), and healthcare consumers. 
	GPs and practice nurses who completed the survey were invited for interviews to explore their T&CM knowledge, experiences, and perceived barriers/facilitators to care collaboration with T&CM providers. The survey was distributed through Australian Primary Health Networks, professional associations, consumer groups and social media platforms.";"Between July-August 2024, 697 valid surveys were received. Respondents were predominantly female, aged 45-64 years (54%), had used T&CM (91%), represented all Australian states and territories, and 66% were born in Australia. The sample comprised 37% who identified as consumers (n=256), 28% as T&CM practitioners (n=195), 25% medical or allied healthcare providers (n=177), 8% health care admin/policy/academic (n=53), and 2% unclassified. Interviews were undertaken with 10 GPs and 3 practice nurses. Key findings include:
•  Overwhelming support for formal integration of T&CM practitioners including 94% of consumer and 82% of medical/allied practitioner respondents. 
•  Around 80% of respondents believed qualified T&CM practitioners could potentially contribute to meeting the goals of the Australian Government’s Primary Health Care 10 Year Plan and National Preventive Health Strategy. 
•  75% of medical/allied respondents supported access to systems of T&CM that are based on beliefs or knowledge that does not align with biomedical science. 
•  61% of surveyed medical/allied providers referred to T&CM practitioners, although some avoided written referrals due to medicolegal concerns. 
•  82% of T&CM providers referred patients to GPs. 
While two-thirds of medical/allied survey respondents considered themselves sufficiently informed to advise patients about T&CM, interviewed GPs expressed hesitancy in referring patients to T&CM providers, citing insufficient knowledge about their education and scope of practice. The study's limitations include low survey uptake among individuals who have not used T&CM or do not support its integration.";A cross section of Australian stakeholders believe that greater utilisation of qualified T&CM practitioners could enhance the healthcare system’s focus on disease prevention and health promotion, and help to meet the goals of government strategies to improve health outcomes through strengthening locally delivered, person-centred, wellness-focused multidisciplinary care. Persistent barriers to collaborative care between T&CM and mainstream providers need to be addressed to facilitate effective integration. The perspectives of participants for and against integration are examined.;"Australia; Traditional Complementary and Integrative Medicine; healthcare integration; primary care; Consumer Participation"

Health-promoting behaviours - including physical activity, sleep, social connection - are associated with improved mental wellbeing, yet there is limited insight into how students perceive and use these strategies for self-management. ;In 2024, Australian university students were recruited via digital and community channels to complete an online survey exploring wellbeing management. Eligible participants were aged ?18 years, enrolled in a university program, and had no history of five specified psychiatric disorders. Quantitative data were analysed descriptively. A subset (n=375, 45%) responded to an open-ended question exploring lifestyle-based mental health strategies. Responses were analysed using inductive thematic analysis.;The characteristics of free-text responders were largely similar to non-responders in ethnicity, gender, residential status, mental health conditions, and lifestyle categories. Statistically significant differences showed responders were more likely to be aged ?26 years, live alone, be enrolled in a PhD, report chronic conditions, and practice meditation and wellness activities, while being less likely to study full-time or report average/higher socioeconomic status—suggesting that those with lived experience and greater health awareness were more inclined to share personal insights. Thematic analysis identified three key themes: (1) awareness of lifestyle’s role in mental health, (2) barriers to implementation (e.g., financial constraints, time pressure, low self-esteem), and (3) enablers of engagement (e.g., personalisation, flexibility, routine). Students most frequently identified physical activity, social connection, and time in nature as effective self-management tools. While knowledge was high, sustained behaviour change was hindered by structural and personal barriers.;University students value lifestyle-based approaches for mental health but face common implementation challenges. Public health efforts should prioritise accessible, student-centred interventions that integrate behavioural flexibility and social support to promote sustainable mental wellbeing strategies in tertiary settings.;"mental health; university students; health-promoting behaviours; mixed-methods epidemiology; self-management"

In people with multiple sclerosis (pwMS), higher mastery has been linked to improved psychological wellbeing, illness acceptance, treatment adherence, and quality of life. Given MS’s progressive nature, understanding how mastery evolves over time and identifying modifiable predictors may guide interventions to support self-management and long-term health outcomes.;A longitudinal survey of 602 pwMS was conducted over five years. Mastery was assessed using the Pearlin Mastery Scale. Group-based trajectory modelling identified distinct mastery trajectories over time. Predictors included demographic (e.g., socioeconomic status), clinical (e.g., depression, fatigue), and lifestyle variables (diet, physical activity, vitamin D, meditation, non-smoking). Multinomial logistic regression was used to evaluate predictors of trajectory group membership, with the mid mastery group used as the reference.;Four distinct mastery trajectories were identified: low (10%), mid (43%), high (34%), and highest (13%), with these proportions representing the assignment to each group. Comparing the high vs. mid mastery groups, higher than average socioeconomic status (RR=2.24, 95% CI: 1.32–3.80), high quality diet (RR=1.40, 95% CI: 1.09–1.80), and regular physical activity (RR=1.28, 95% CI: 1.00–1.65) were positively associated with high mastery. In contrast, depression (RR=0.43, 95% CI: 0.25–0.74) and fatigue (RR=0.64, 95% CI: 0.48–0.86) were negatively associated. These findings highlight the role of modifiable lifestyle and clinical factors in supporting higher mastery trajectories over time in pwMS.;Public health and clinical interventions that target depression and fatigue, alongside promoting healthy diets and physical activity, may improve self-mastery in pwMS. Enhancing mastery may support better disease self-management, reduce symptom burden, and improve quality of life in this population.;"Multiple sclerosis; self-mastery trajectories; predictors of self-mastery"

Temporomandibular Joint Balancing Therapy (TBT), a manual therapy in Korean traditional medicine, has emerged as a complementary approach for TMD treatment. TBT aims to correct jaw imbalances, relieve pain, and improve function through specific manipulation techniques. Despite growing clinical use, systematic data on how TBT is implemented in practice, its perceived effectiveness, and barriers to implementation remain limited. This study surveyed TBT-trained practitioners to evaluate its clinical application patterns and practitioners' perceptions, aiming to guide future standardization and evidence-based integration.;"We conducted a cross-sectional survey among 90 Korean practitioners (76% male, 24% female; 93% Korean medicine doctors) who completed a TBT training program. The questionnaire covered demographic information, training experience, TBT utilization (frequency of use, conditions treated), perceived effectiveness (confidence level, treatment duration, patient satisfaction), barriers to use, and suggestions for improvement. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and chi-square tests to examine associations between practitioner characteristics and various aspects of TBT practice.";"Descriptive analyses revealed that most respondents were Korean medicine doctors (93%) with varied age distribution (46% aged 60+, 41% in 40s-50s). Most completed TBT training before 2020 (59%) and received integrated theory-practical education (99%). Chi-square analyses showed significant associations between gender and preferred education methods (p=0.005), with males favoring hands-on components (58% vs. 33%) and females preferring theoretical content (43% vs. 24%). 
TBT usage varied considerably: 33% (95% CI[23.3%, 42.7%]) reported frequent use (?10 cases weekly), 19% rarely used it, and 48% applied it occasionally. Primary applications included TMD (67%), non-TMJ musculoskeletal conditions (64%), and spinal/postural issues (59%). While 26% reported high patient satisfaction and 58% moderate satisfaction, practitioners identified notable barriers: patient cost burden (55%), skill deficiency (42%), difficulty obtaining patient consent (36%), and time constraints (30%). Most practitioners (80%) indicated that significant symptom improvement typically required 1-3 months of therapy.
The findings highlight several needs: standardized evidence-based protocols for different conditions, enhanced practical training addressing gender-specific preferences, regular case-sharing platforms, and research addressing cost-effectiveness concerns. These measures would improve practitioner confidence, optimize treatment efficacy, and facilitate TBT integration into mainstream TMD management.";"This survey provides important insights into the current status of TBT implementation among trained Korean practitioners. The findings underscore several needs for advancing TBT practice: 1) developing standardized, evidence-based protocols for different TMD subtypes and related conditions; 2) enhancing practitioner education through expanded practical training and case-based learning, particularly addressing gender differences in training preferences; 3) establishing regular case-sharing platforms among practitioners; and 4) conducting clinical research addressing cost-effectiveness and treatment duration concerns. These measures would improve practitioner confidence, optimize treatment efficacy, and facilitate TBT integration into mainstream TMD management as a standardized complementary therapy.";"Temporomandibular Joint Disorder; Temporomandibular Joint Balancing Therapy; Traditional Korean Medicine; Manual Therapy"

It embodies long-standing heritage, distinct ethnic characteristics, and regional features. As a vital component of traditional Chinese medicine, ethnic minority medicine exhibits unique clinical advantages and significant service potential. However, its diverse theoretical systems and complex intervention schemes complicate objective clinical efficacy evaluation. Moreover, the unique cultural attributes of each ethnic minority medicine hinder cross-cultural promotion.
Evidence-based medicine (EBM) prioritizes the use of the best available evidence to guide clinical practice. EBM capability encompasses the ability to collect, evaluate, integrate evidence, make clinical decisions and conduct research based on EBM principles. Enhancing EBM capability is crucial for improving the scientific evaluation of ethnic minority medicine's efficacy and promoting its modernization and internationalization.
To address the current status of clinical research in ethnic minority medicine, this study surveyed specialized medical units and research institutions to comprehensively assess the current EBM capability and specific development needs, providing a basis for formulating high-quality development strategies.";"A questionnaire survey was administered across multiple ethnic minority medical institutions and research organizations, focusing on three core dimensions: (1) perceptions and attitudes towards evidence-based medicine (EBM); (2) advantages and challenges in the development of ethnic minority medicine; and (3) demands and recommendations for enhancing EBM capability within ethnic minority medicine.";This study collected a total of 501 valid questionnaires, of which 103 were obtained through resending to regions with insufficient initial participation. The survey respondents included 354 practitioners of ethnic minority medicine (70.66%), representing Tibetan, Mongolian, Uyghur, Zhuang, and Korean medicine. Among the respondents, 146 (29.14%) reported familiarity with evidence-based medicine (EBM), while 355 (70.86%) had only a general understanding or had never heard of EBM. A significant majority (93.61%) believed that introducing EBM could promote the development of ethnic minority medicine. The primary challenges identified were the lack of EBM professionals and limited understanding of its application in clinical practice (88.22%). In a 9-point importance rating for enhancing evidence-based abilities, high scores were noted for standardizing clinical practice guidelines (7.50 ± 1.90) and determining sample sizes in clinical research (7.45 ± 1.90). For improving clinical research literacy, respondents emphasized the need for expert academic lectures and experience sharing (80.64%) and evidence-based methodology monographs on ethnic minority medicine (80.04%).;Practitioners of ethnic minority medicine demonstrate a positive attitude toward the integration of evidence-based medicine (EBM). However, significant gaps remain in EBM education and dissemination. Enhancing evidence-based capabilities can be achieved through targeted measures, including cultivating or recruiting EBM professionals, establishing evidence-based support platforms for clinical research, organizing regular academic lectures and exchanges, and strengthening the development of theoretical frameworks and evaluation systems tailored to ethnic minority medicine. These efforts will facilitate the adoption of evidence-based practices that align with the unique characteristics of ethnic minority medicine.;"Ethnic medicine; Evidence-based capability; Cross-sectional survey"

Uyghur medicine has developed unique therapies and effective medications through extensive clinical experience, offering potential solutions for vitiligo treatment. 
We have carried out the following two tasks in the preliminary work: (1) In response to the complex composition of Uyghur medical intervention for  vitiligo and the subjective criteria for judging treatment timing, a method combining quantitative data analysis with qualitative expert consensus was adopted to develop standardized and operable diagnostic and therapeutic protocols as well as quantitative evaluation criteria. (2) Relying on the Uyghur medical consortium, a cluster-randomized controlled trial was conducted to assess the effectiveness and safety of the optimized vitiligo treatment protocol. 
However, primary hospitals practicing Uyghur medicine are scattered across different regions, with significant disparities in local economic and medical levels, leading to considerable differences in their access to resources. How to promote the widespread adoption and application of optimized treatment protocols, and facilitate the implementation of the developed protocols and technologies in medical consortium hospitals to improve the quality of primary healthcare services remains a challenge. 
We aim to investigate the facilitators and barriers to the implementation of the optimized Uyghur medicine treatment protocol for vitiligo at the local level, and to understand the main difficulties in adhering to the protocol from the perspective of various stakeholders.";A semi-structured interview approach was employed, involving doctors, patients, hospital administrators, caregivers, and other relevant stakeholders. The interviews focused on several key aspects: the implementation status of the treatment protocol, the impact of health insurance policies (such as hospital stay duration control), patient satisfaction, subjective perceptions of treatment effectiveness, and the main difficulties identified by stakeholders in adhering to the protocol.;Interviews were conducted with stakeholders from 10 Uyghur medicine hospitals of different levels in Xinjiang, including 2 hospital administrators, 19 doctors, 14 patients, 3 caregivers, and 3 methodology experts. The preliminary analysis revealed the following results:1.Main Barriers: 1?The optimized protocol requires a 3-month treatment course (with two follow-up treatments per week after discharge), which leads to poor adherence among patients living far from the hospital. 2?Some hospitals lack an in-house pharmacy, making it difficult to prepare oral medications, resulting in patients having to purchase them at a higher price. 3?A portion of patients are not proactive in their treatment, showing little concern for their condition and unwillingness to follow up. 2.Main Facilitators: 1?High patient satisfaction. 2?Standardized treatment reduces the impact of varying physician skill levels on patient outcomes.;Ensuring that research outcomes truly benefit the rural and pastoral populations requires further investigation. It is essential to consider the local realities and adopt targeted dissemination measures (implementation strategies). In subsequent research, we will take into account the impact of influencing factors, including the influence of ethnic minority cultural factors. We will employ a co-design approach locally and incorporate implementation science methods to identify implementation strategies and further verify the implementation outcomes.;"Ethnic medicine; vitiligo; Implementation Science"

We searched PubMed, PsycInfo, and Central until April 2024. We calculated standardized mean differences (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) from both intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol (PP) data for symptom severity (primary outcome), health-related quality of life and depression (secondary outcomes) using Hedges’ correction for small samples. For risk of bias (RoB) assessment, we used the Cochrane RoB 2 tool.;We included seven publications on six randomized controlled trials that examined 517 patients with PTSD, depression, and mixed non-psychotic mental disorders and compared pr???y?ma to passive controls (wait list and attention control) or standard care (psychotherapy, electroconvulsive therapy, antidepressants). Overall RoB was some concerns in two and high in four studies. Meta-analysis of both the ITT (SMD = -0.27, 95% CI = [-0.52, -0.03], I² = 10%) and PP samples (SMD = -0.35, 95% CI = [-0.57, -0.12], I² = 0%) showed that pr???y?ma significantly reduced post-intervention symptom severity in comparison to passive controls. When compared to standard care, both ITT and PP meta-analyses showed comparable results in reducing symptom severity. For secondary outcomes, only PP analyses on quality of life showed significantly higher post-intervention effects for pr???y?ma in comparison to passive controls (SMD = 0.59, 95% CI = [0.31, 0.87], I² = 20). Sensitivity analyses excluding all studies with high risk of overall bias revealed significant effects of pr???y?ma on symptom severity and quality of life, however only in PP samples and in comparison to passive controls. Adverse events were reported inadequately.;This meta-analysis suggests short-term effects of pr???y?ma when integrated in out- and inpatient care of mental disorders. In consideration of the overall high risk of bias and low number of analyzed patients, pr???y?ma should not be used instead of standard therapies. Further research is needed to explore long-term effects and adequately assess adverse events.;"Pranayama; yoga; Mental Disorders; Meta-Analysis; Systematic Review"

Against this background, integrating salutogenic strategies – which emphasize health literacy and self-regulation – alongside symptomatic treatment may provide additional therapeutic value. We therefore developed and tested a mind-body medicine group program for its effectiveness and safety.;"We conducted a randomized controlled trial (NCT05798221) including 86 patients (77.9% female; mean age 50.8 ± 13.0 years) who reported post-COVID-19 symptoms for an average of 20.0 ± 9.8 months, following 1.5 ± 0.7 SARS-CoV-2 infections. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either a 10-week interdisciplinary group intervention (NASH) plus treatment as usual (TAU), or TAU alone. The NASH program was based on the principles of mind-body medicine, Traditional European Medicine, and ear acupuncture. It included weekly six-hour sessions combining interdisciplinary group consultations, health education, and guided exercises in physical activity, relaxation, breathing techniques, nutrition, and complementary self-care. The primary outcome was post-COVID-19 symptom severity, assessed by the Somatic Symptom Scale (SSS) at 16 weeks. Further secondary outcomes were assessed at both week 10 and week 16. Statistical analyses were conducted on an intention-to-treat (ITT) basis using analyses of covariance, adjusting for baseline values and participants’ treatment expectations. Results are presented as mean differences with 95% confidence intervals (CI).";ITT analyses revealed significant between-group differences on post-COVID-19 symptom severity at week 10 (-3.61 SSS, 95%CI=-5.47|-1.75, p < .001) as well as at week 16 (-3.00 SSS, 95%CI=-4.64|-1.35, p < .001). Further analyses will reveal possible effects on secondary outcomes. Adverse events were mild and transient, including occasional dizziness, skin irritation, circulatory discomfort, and headaches related to specific NASH techniques (e.g. breathing exercises, mustard flour, acupuncture, and cupping). Participation in the NASH intervention was not associated with serious adverse events.;NASH significantly reduced post-COVID-19 symptom severity compared to TAU, with effects sustained over 16 weeks. The intervention was well tolerated, with only minor adverse events reported. The findings underscore the potential of integrating salutogenic strategies into the treatment of individuals with post-COVID-19 syndrome.;"Mind-Body-Medicine; Post-COVID-19; Traditional European Medicine; acupuncture; Self-Care"

Copper Chloride Crystallisation (CCC) is an interesting methodology, belonging to metabolomic fingerprinting based on pattern formation, able to study samples comprehensively. It can potentially characterise qualitative differences due to specific pharmaceutical processes as well as their physical/chemical properties.;Viscum album L. extracts obtained by mixing fermented juices of summer and winter harvests were used as samples.  CCC sensitivity to qualitative differences was tested with three levels of increasing difficulty. The three levels aimed to differentiate extracts 1) of two mistletoe subspecies, 2) of mistletoe belonging to the same subspecies but grown on two different host trees, and 3) mixed by hand or with a specific machine. A computer analysis was performed on the outputs. 7 parameters related to the structure and the texture of the CCC patterns were selected.;All 7 parameters showed significant differences (ANOVA p < 0.006) at the first sensitivity level. 4 parameters (3 of which related to texture) showed significant differences (ANOVA p < 0.003) at the second sensitivity level. 2 parameters (both related to structure) showed significant differences (ANOVA p < 0.006) at the last sensitivity level (effect size range 1.75 – 0.22, 0.56 – 0.26, 0.27 – 0.20, respectively).;CCC proved able to detect differences in a phytotherapeutic product, spanning from easily detectable chemical differences to qualitative ones.

Through a wide variety of homeopathic medicinal products, homeopathy addresses potentially all medical conditions. Its therapeutic effects have faced controversy since its early development, despite a substantial empirical body of research. Since several decades, scientists active in homeopathic fields have been gathering an expanding body of literature. Maintaining an updated bibliography that organises clinical evidence by medical condition is essential for future studies.;Seven online databases (Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, SCOPUS, Science Citation Index, CINAHL, and LILACS) were searched for homeopathy and related terms for the years 2021 to 2025. We included studies that compared a homeopathic product or intervention with a control regarding the therapeutic or preventive outcome of a disease (classified according to the International Classification of Diseases-11). All languages were included. The data were extracted independently by two reviewers and analysed descriptively.;Seventy investigations met the inclusion criteria. Additionally, two studies published before 2021, which had been overlooked in the previous HOMIS, were found, bringing the total to 72. Fifty-two studies had a therapeutic purpose, nineteen had a preventive purpose, and one had both. 87 percent were randomized controlled trials (n=63), whereas the rest were non-randomized studies (n=9). The leading comparator was placebo (n=46). The type of homeopathic intervention was classified as complex (n=7), individualized(n=33), routine (n=16) and other (n=16). The potencies ranged from D1 to LM12. The included studies explored the effect of homeopathy mainly on COVID-19 infection (n=13) and a total of 23 medical conditions.

Valuable tools for investigating this topic are bioassays using plants sensitive to homeopathic remedies. The aim of our study was to investigate the effect of the homeopathic remedy Carbo vegetabilis 30x on garden cress seedlings (Lepidium sativum L.) grown in calcium nitrate solution.;Cress seedlings were cultivated upright on chromatography paper in hanging plastic bags containing calcium nitrate solution (0.5 g/l), which led to an increase in shoot length and a decrease in root length compared to cress grown in pure water. The treatment of the seedlings consisted of dissolved Carbo vegetabilis 30x globules or dissolved unimpregnated sugar globules as control, or the cress was left untreated. The bags containing the seedlings were scanned after a 5-day growth period at 14.5°C, and the length of the seedlings was analysed with the software ImageJ and a digital tablet. The outcome parameters were shoot length, root length, total length, and root/shoot ratio. To evaluate the stability of the experimental system, Systematic Negative Control (SNC) experiments were conducted. A total of 12 independent experiments were performed involving around 25000 seedlings. All experiments were randomised and blinded during treatment, measurement, and basic data analysis.;"When Carbo vegetabilis 30x was applied, a slight yet significant increase in shoot length of 0.05 cm (p=0.002) was observed compared to the control. There were no significant effects on the parameters root length and total length. The root/shoot ratio of the seedlings decreased significantly (p=0.003) through application of Carbo vegetabilis 30x. The SNC experiments showed no significant differences in cress growth, suggesting a stable experimental setup. 

These results indicate a small but significant effect of Carbo vegetabilis 30x on the growth of cress cultivated in calcium nitrate solution. Due to the large number of samples in this test series and the correspondingly high statistical power, a random result is not to be assumed. In addition, the SNC experiments verified the stability of the experimental setup.";The obtained data are in favour of a possible effect of Carbo vegetabilis 30x on cress seedlings. Future studies can use this bioassay to investigate the mode of action of homeopathic remedies.;"Homeopathy; Bioassay; Cress; Plant model; Potentisation"

The most common constituent is 6-Shogaol which has been shown to be a promising anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory agent that also possesses strong hepatoprotective effects. In a small investigative study among six early-stage, transfusion-independent patients with MDS, Golombick et al. (2017) found that 6-Shogaol caused a decrease in the serum ferritin (SF) levels of three patients who had elevated SF at baseline. Upregulation of hepcidin levels was observed in two of these three patients, possibly through an improvement in liver function with 6-Shogaol supplementation. Hence, 6-Shogaol, a natural food derivative, may lower the iron overload by decreasing iron absorption;A pilot clinical trial was conducted in two Sydney Haematological centres. Thirty adult patients with diagnosed Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) were enrolled and received 1 tablet (equal to 20mg of ginger standardised to 20% 6-shogaol) for 24 weeks. Patients were followed up two monthly. Bloods were taken every two months for full blood count, liver enzymes, electrolytes, kidney function, full iron studies including ferritin, BUN and thyroid status. Another blood pathology tube was taken to measure Hepcidin. Quality of life questionnaires were also conducted. ;"Thirty patients were enrolled, with 4 patients withdrawing. One due to seeing no change, one passed away for other reasons, one patient has an allergic reaction to the ginger supplement, and another was excluded due to disease progression. Of the 26 participants that completed the 6 months of supplementation, n=16 showed some benefit in haematological parameters. Thirteen of the 16 participants that showed some benefit haematologically, also showed improvements in cytopenia. Three of the participants had reduced ferritin levels and half (n=8) of the 16 participants showed 10% disease improvement with the other half (n=6) showing 10% improvement in cytopenia. Three of the participants had more than 30% improvement in disease status. 
The results of this trial indicate that a ginger extract (6-Shogaol) at a dose of 20mg daily may assist in reducing disease progression and improve haematological parameters. Considering this cohort is elderly with comorbidities, this trial indicates that 6-shogaol can be taken safely in this cohort without extra burden on the participants

Chinese medicinal herbs (CMHs) are often used alongside chemotherapy to help manage these effects. This systematic review aimed to assess the effects of CMHs in alleviating chemotherapy-induced short-term side effects in women with early breast cancer.;We searched eight databases and two registry platform, up to May 2024. We screened the reference lists of relevant trials and reviews. Two authors independently extracted data and assessed the risk of bias. We assessed the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach.;"We included 25 RCTs with 2,319 participants and 17 different CMHs, each study ranging from 30 to 352 participants. Only one study has a low risk of bias, other studies have at least one domain at unclear or high risk of bias.
Main results for clinically key outcomes:
Incidence of nausea or vomiting: CMHs may reduce this outcome when compared with no treatment (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.86; very low certainty, 4 or 6 cycles). CMHs plus ST (versus ST; RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.15 to 1.38; very low certainty) may have no effect on this outcome. 
Incidence of fatigue/relief of fatigue: black soybean extract EW02 plus ST (versus placebo+ST; RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.64; very low certainty, 2-3 cycles) and Buzhong Yiqi pills (versus no intervention; RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.09; very low certainty, 2 cycles) may have no effect on relieving the fatigue.
Karnofsky performance status improvement (?10 points increase): CMHs (versus no intervention; RR 2.15, 95% CI 1.24 to 3.72; very low certainty, 2 to 8 cycles) may improve the QoL. However, CMHs plus ST (versus ST; RR 1.35, 95% CI 0.73 to 2.47; very low certainty, 2 and 6 cycles) may have no effect on the QoL assess by Karnofsky Performance Status improvement.
Abnormal rate of liver function: CMHs (versus no intervention; RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.99; very low certainty) may reduce the abnormal liver function during 12 days to 6 cycles of chemotherapy. However, CMHs plus ST (versus ST; RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.22 to 1.18; very low certainty) may have no effect on the abnormal liver function during 4 and 6 cycles of chemotherapy. 
Abnormal rate of renal function: CMHs (versus no intervention; RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.31 to 2.30; very low certainty) may have no effect on the abnormal renal function during 3 to 6 cycles of chemotherapy.";Low to very low certainty evidence suggested that CMHs may had potential effects to reduce the incidence of nausea and vomiting. Moderate to very low certainty evidence showed a beneficial effect on the quality of life from CMHs. We identified no high certainty evidence for the effectiveness and safety of any therapy included. Only minor AEs were reported in the studies and there was insufficient evidence of adverse events/reactions related to CMHs. Large, well-designed clinical trials targeting the most promising CMHs are needed before any conclusions can be drawn.;"Chinese medicinal herbs; chemotherapy; side effects; early breast cancer; Systematic Review"

Women with DOR, trying to conceive naturally or by in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer (IVF-ET), were randomly assigned to BCR group or placebo group. Both groups were treated for 3 consecutive menstrual cycles. Primary outcomes were ongoing pregnancy rates, live birth rates, antral follicle count (AFC), endometrial thickness, perfusion index of ovarian artery (PI), and female hormones [estradiol (E2), progesterone (P), luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH)]. Secondary outcomes included Score of Traditional Chinese Medicine Syndrome Scale (TCMSS), safety and health-related outcomes (mental health, quality of life, diet, exercise, sleep and weight). Statistical significance of the differences between the two groups (P-values) were exploratory. ;Sixty women completed the randomized controlled trial (RCT) by March 2023. Participants included 36 women from the Wenling Clinical Center (Wenling City, Zhejiang Province, China) and 24 women from the Beijing Clinical Center (Fangshan District, Beijing, China). All 60 participants (100% adherence) completed the intervention protocol and endpoint assessments. After treatment, in the BCR group, the AFC, endometrial thickness and PI, while the serum E2, P, AMH levels were increased compared with those in the placebo group(P<0.05, P<0.01) . The serum LH and FSH in the BCR group were lover than the placebo group(P<0.05), as well as the score of TCMSS.

While the results on DHEA-induced endometrial improvement are controversial. To evaluate whether DHEA intervention improved endometrial function and reproductive outcomes during in vitro fertilization/intracytoplasmic sperm injection (IVF/ICSI) cycles and to thus provide clinical recommendations.;"PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE and Web of Science from database inception to 31 July 2024, without language restrictions. The references of conference proceedings and websites on clinical trials were manually checked. Parallel-controlled randomized controlled trials (RCTs) design; women underwent IVF/ICSI, patients in the experimental group received adminstration with DHEA, whereas the control group received with or without placebo; and the outcomes included reproductive or endometrial function. RCTs evaluating the effects of DHEA on IVF/ICSI outcomes were included. Risk of bias and quality of evidence (QoE) were assessed according to the Cochrane Collaboration’s tool and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation system. Odds ratios (ORs) and mean differences (MDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were assessed by random-effects or fixed-effects models. Subgroup and meta-regression analyses were used to find sources of heterogeneity. Trial sequential analysis was used to judge the stability of the outcomes. Trial sequential analysis was used in order to control for random errors.";"A total of 16 trials included 1973 women. DHEA treatment significantly increased endometrial thickness (MD=0.93, CI: 0.27 to 1.60; low QoE), which helped improve clinical pregnancy rate (CPR) (OR=1.34, 95% CI: 1.08 to 1.67; low QoE). DHEA administration also increased the quality of oocyte and embryo [including the number of oocytes retrieved (MD=0.73, CI: 0.36 to 1.10; low QoE), oocytes fertilized (MD=0.48, CI: 0.10 to 0.87; low QoE), transferred embryos (MD=0.27, CI: 0.09 to 0.46; very low QoE), and high-quality embryos (MD=0.65, CI: 0.27 to 1.03; low QoE)]. Subgroup and meta-regression analyses revealed that heterogeneity might be related to disease type, ovarian stimulation protocol, and addition time of DHEA treatment. There was insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion regarding the live birth rate/ongoing pregnancy rate, miscarriage rate, and M? oocyte number of DHEA. And no severe adverse effects were observed with DHEA administration. Due to the apparent improvemen in the CPR, women with thin endometrium might benefit from DHEA cotreament.";"Due to the limited sample size and methodological problems, the QoE was low to very low; hence, the results should be interpreted with caution.

Respondents were recruited from 60 medical institutions spanning 23 provincial-level regions (Grade 3A hospitals: 60.71%, i.e., the highest tier in China’s three-level system). The sample included clinicians from both TCM-related departments and non-TCM departments; 24.29% reported working in TCM-related departments, with the remainder distributed across internal-medicine subspecialties. The instrument covered six domains: demographics, prescription frequency, quality perception, medication-guidance practices, healthcare-policy impact, and comparative efficacy versus traditional decoctions. Analyses were quantitative (descriptive statistics and chi-square tests of association); no qualitative interviews were included in this analysis. Reporting followed STROBE recommendations for cross-sectional studies.

Despite 85.72% rating CHFG quality favorably—attributing this mainly to raw-material standards (87.72%) and manufacturing processes (82.46%)—68.57% reported limited awareness of storage-stability issues. Policy factors were salient: 80.7% viewed insurance coverage as pivotal, and 48.25% explicitly considered reimbursement when prescribing, whereas only 14.29% reported hospital assortments fully meeting clinical needs. Training gaps were evident: 60.7% rated institutional education on CHFG (e.g., dose-conversion sheets) as absent/insufficient, and many noted a lack of standardized medication-guidance materials. Collectively, these data indicate policy constraints, education deficits, and affordability concerns continue to suppress adoption despite perceived convenience and acceptable safety relative to decoctions.;Scaling CHFG use will require coordinated interventions: broaden insurance coverage, standardize dose-conversion protocols and medication-guidance materials, and strengthen physician training. Future work should prioritize real-world comparative-effectiveness and cost-effectiveness evaluations to narrow the gap between perceived value and routine clinical use. Guidance from STROBE can further enhance transparency and comparability of CHFG implementation research.;"Chinese herbal formula granules; clinical application; physician perceptions; Health Policy; traditional medicine integration"

Fire acupuncture, a traditional Chinese medicine therapy, has the potential for nerve-immune regulation and multi-target intervention. This study aimed to explore the effects and potential mechanisms of fire acupuncture on dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis in rats, focusing on the regulation of cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway (CAIP), autophagy and antioxidant.;"UC rat models were induced by DSS and randomly divided into several groups: Control, DSS model, Fire acupuncture (FA), 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA), sham acupuncture (Sham-FA), Sham-FA + chloroquine (Sham-FA+CQ) and FA + chloroquine (FA+CQ). 
Phenotypic assessments included disease activity index (DAI), colon length, spleen index, histopathological damage, and immunohistochemical detection of tight junction proteins (ZO-1, occludin). The CAIP was assessed via serum norepinephrine (NE), pancreatic polypeptide (PP), inflammatory factors (IL-1?, TNF-?, IL-6), and colon acetylcholine (ACh) levels using ELISA, and colon IL-1?, TNF-?, IL-6 transcription levels using RT-qPCR. Western blot was used to analyze ?7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (?7nAChR) expression.
Autophagic flux was evaluated through colon LC3B-II, P62, and AMPK/ULK1/mTOR pathway proteins via Western blot. Oxidative stress was evaluated through colon glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) using ELISA. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were detected by immunofluorescence. 
For pathway validation, transcription levels of P62, Keap1, and NRF2 were assessed by RT-qPCR. Western blot analysis measured P62/Keap1/NRF2/HO1 pathway proteins. Co-localization of P62, Keap1, and NRF2 was analyzed by multiplex immunofluorescence. The role of P62-Keap1 autophagic degradation in the pathway was further validated using CQ.";"Fire acupuncture significantly reduced DAI scores (P<0.01), restored colon length (P<0.001), and alleviated spleen index (P<0.001). FA enhanced mucosal barrier function by upregulating tight junction proteins ZO-1 and Occludin (P<0.001, P<0.01), reducing inflammatory infiltration, promoting crypt regeneration, and lowering histopathological index (P<0.001). 
FA suppressed sympathetic nervous system activity by lowering NE (P<0.001), activated the vagus nerve by increasing PP (P<0.001) and ACh (P<0.01), upregulated ?7nAChR (P<0.01), and reduced pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1?, P<0.05; TNF-?, P<0.01; IL-6, P<0.001).
FA activated AMPK? Thr172 phosphorylation (p-AMPK/AMPK, P<0.001; p-AMPK/?-actin, P<0.001), enhanced autophagic flux by upregulating ULK1 (P<0.01) and Beclin1 (P<0.001) while inhibiting mTOR (P<0.001), and reduced LC3B-II (P<0.001) and P62 (P<0.05). CQ inhibition of autophagic flux caused accumulation of LC3B-II and P62 (P<0.05 and P<0.01, respectively). FA also decreased reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels (P<0.001) and increased antioxidant enzymes (GSH-PX, P<0.001; SOD, P<0.01).
FA upregulated the mRNA levels of P62 (P<0.05), Keap1 (P<0.001), and NRF2 (P<0.001), increased P62 Ser 349 phosphorylation (p-P62/P62, P<0.001; p-P62/gapdh, P<0.05), promoted competitive binding of P62 to Keap1 (P62-Keap1 %area, P<0.001), and targeted Keap1 for autophagic degradation (lowered Keap1 protein, P<0.001), thereby enhancing NRF2 nuclear translocation (P<0.001) and upregulating downstream markers HO1 and NQO1 (both P<0.001). Pathway inhibition experiments showed that CQ blocked P62-Keap1 autophagic degradation and NRF2 nuclear translocation, significantly attenuating FA’s therapeutic effects.";Fire acupuncture significantly improved DSS-induced colitis via CAIP and activated the AMPK/P62/NRF2 axis.;"Fire acupuncture; Ulcerative colitis; Cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway; Autophagy; Oxidative Stress"

This study aimed to evaluate patients’ awareness, satisfaction, and barriers to CHFG utilization in China.
";A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 156 patients across 60 medical institutions. The questionnaire encompassed six domains: demographic characteristics, disease spectrum, medication habits, cognitive pathways, efficacy/safety perceptions, and healthcare policy influence. Descriptive statistics and chi-square tests were employed to analyze associations between variables.;"Key findings revealed that a predominantly young adult female population (83.97% female; 76.28% aged 18–45 years) was observed, with high awareness of CHFGs (94.87% of respondents had prior knowledge, primarily through physician recommendations (85.14%)). While over 80% favored CHFGs for their convenience, such as eliminating decoction requirements, 60% reported dissolution-related challenges during use. Safety perceptions exhibited contradictions, with 54.3% expressing concerns about heavy metal residues and 39.6% fearing allergic reactions, despite 61.07% stating no apprehensions about adverse effects. Policy influence appeared significant yet underrecognized, as 78.57% acknowledged insurance reimbursement as a critical usage determinant, but 52.7% remained unaware of specific policy details. Efficacy comparisons further highlighted divided opinions, with 40.71% perceiving CHFGs as equally effective as traditional decoctions and 29.29% consistently favoring conventional preparations, underscoring persistent debates over therapeutic equivalence.
While CHFGs were lauded for convenience (90.38%) and alignment with modern lifestyles, challenges persisted: dissolution issues (61.5%), taste dissatisfaction (56.25%), and incomplete policy awareness. Patients prioritized taste improvement (56.25% cited this as a reason for non-recommendation) and transparent quality control. Notably, 43.51% expressed concerns over additive excess and pesticide residues, reflecting skepticism toward industrial processing.
";This study highlights a paradox: while CHFGs offer practical advantages, their clinical uptake is constrained by technical limitations and policy gaps. Recommendations include optimizing dissolution technology, expanding insurance coverage, and enhancing patient education on production standards. Future efforts should focus on bridging the gap between perceived convenience and systemic barriers to realize the full potential of CHFGs in integrated healthcare systems.;"Chinese herbal formula granules; patient perspectives; healthcare integration; traditional medicine; clinical application"

The dynamics and mechanisms of meditations on oral and gut microbiome modulations are not well understood. This study investigates the short-term modulations of the gut and oral microbiome during an Arhatic Yoga meditation retreat as well as on the role of microbiome in improving well-being through a possible gut-brain axis.;A single-arm pilot clinical trial was conducted in a controlled environment during a 9-day intensive retreat of Arhatic Yoga meditation practices with vegetarian diet. Oral and fecal samples of 24 practitioners were collected at the start (Day0: T1), middle (Day3: T2), and end (Day9:T3) of the retreat. Targeted 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing was performed for both oral and gut samples. Functional pathway predictions were identified using phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states (PICRUSt2). DESeq2 was used to identify the differential abundant taxa. Various statistical analyses were performed to assess the significant changes in the data.;Our findings revealed that Arhatic Yoga meditation together with a vegetarian diet led to changes in the oral and gut microbiome profiles within the 9-day retreat. Oral microbiome profile showed a significant (p?<?0.05) difference in the species richness and evenness at the end of study, while non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) confirmed the shift in the gut microbiome profile of the practitioners by T2 timepoint, which was further supported by PERMANOVA analysis (p?<?0.05). Health-benefiting microbes known to improve the gastrointestinal and gut-barrier functions, immune modulation, and gut-brain axis were enriched. gut microbiome of both beginner and advanced Arhatic Yoga practitioners showed similar trends of convergence by the end of study. This implies a strong selection pressure by Arhatic Yoga meditation together with a vegetarian diet on the beneficial gut microbiome.;This pilot study demonstrates that Arhatic Yoga meditation practices combined with a vegetarian diet during a short intensive retreat resulted in enrichment of known health-promoting microbes. Such microbial consortia may be developed for potential health benefits and used as probiotics to improve the gastrointestinal and immune systems, as well as functions mediated by the gut-brain axis;"Microbiome; Gut-Brain Axis; Arhatic Yoga"

After evaluation and selection by experts, a total of 1,389 tongue images from CRC patients and 1,543 tongue images from non-colorectal cancer (NCRC) participants were included in this study. The original tongue images underwent preprocessing, feature extraction, and pattern recognition. Based on traditional machine learning methods, we proposed a multi-feature fusion clas- sification method to construct a tongue diagnosis model for CRC using tongue features as inputs. To further evaluate the role of tongue images in CRC diagno- sis, we validated the proposed method in an independent external cohort, which included 119 CRC patients and 221 NCRC participants from two different hos- pitals.;The tongue-based CRC diagnostic model achieved an accuracy of 87.28% and an F1 score of 0.902, outperforming models that relied solely on single handcrafted features or deep learning-based features. Furthermore, the use of filter-based feature selection methods to eliminate redundant features im- proved the classification performance of the model for CRC.;The intelligent tongue diagnosis model developed in this study demonstrates a high discriminative ability for CRC, offering a novel and valuable approach for CRC diagnosis and screening.;"Artificial Intelligence; tongue diagnosis; Colorectal Cancer; Machine Learning; Diagnostic Model"

This is achieved by harnessing clinical case data, employing knowledge distillation methodologies, and integrating Direct Policy Optimization (DPO) reinforcement learning techniques.;Real-world TCM clinical cases, primarily collected from hospitals and clinical institutions in Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, were employed as the core dataset, reflecting the local cultural and medical characteristics of the Jiangnan region. All data collection and usage strictly adhered to ethical approval protocols, ensuring patient privacy and compliance with institutional review boards. GPT-4o was employed as the reference model to perform knowledge distillation on these clinical case data, thereby generating a high-quality instruction dataset for syndrome differentiation and treatment. The distilled data was subsequently fine-tuned by the Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) method grounded in the Qwen2.5-7B model to improve its abilities of diagnosis and treatment, together with competencies of personalized syndrome differentiation and treatment. Furthermore, an additional dataset of clinical cases was leveraged to emulate the diagnosis and treatment preferences of TCM experts, with the DPO reinforcement learning technique being applied for ongoing refinement and enhancement.;The proposed knowledge distillation approach achieved substantial gains over all baseline models in prescription recommendation tasks, with at least 38.1921 improvement in P@5, 32.6341 in P@10, and 25.0623 in P@20, respectively, and achieved higher BLEU-4 and ROUGE-1 scores compared to direct training, with improved model readability and generalization ability. Despite a marginal reduction in P@5 and P@10 for prescription recommendation tasks, it showed a slight improvement of 0.2857 in P@20, with overall performance comparable to direct training. The model was optimized for improved stability of recommendation via the DPO method, ensuring that when the number of predicted medications exceeded 6, the precision consistently outperformed the knowledge-distilled model. This underscores the efficacy of reinforcement learning in facilitating the model's acquisition of data-driven preferences.;The TCM Large Language Model constructed with knowledge distillation and reinforcement learning strategies effectively enhances diagnosis and treatment reasoning and personalized syndrome differentiation and treatment competencies. By incorporating real-world clinical cases rooted in Nanjing’s cultural and medical heritage, with strict ethical oversight and validation, this approach provides new research directions and technical support for intelligent TCM clinical decision-making.;"Keywords: Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM); syndrome differentiation and treatment; Large Language Model (LLM); knowledge distillation; reinforcement learning"

While these approaches are essential, they do not fully capture the contextual and interpretive dimensions of health interventions in real-life settings. Especially in the field of Traditional, Complementary and Integrative Medicine (TCIM), patient perspectives, meaning-making processes, and complex interaction patterns play a crucial role, but are rarely systematically considered in research and practice. To address this gap, we present a protocol for a metasynthesis of qualitative studies on nature-based and forest-based therapies. This approach aims to complement quantitative findings with in-depth insights into participants’ lived experiences and the multifaceted subjective effects of these interventions.
The metasynthesis is guided by the following research questions: (1) How do nature-based therapies affect the health and well-being of participants? (2) How do participants in nature-based therapies experience and interact with nature and what is relevant to them?";The metasynthesis follows a systematic approach orientated on the methodological framework developed by Sandelowski and colleagues, incorporating six key phases: (1) conceptualizing the qualitative research design, (2) conducting a comprehensive systematic literature search and study selection, (3) classifying the findings, (4) synthesizing and integrating qualitative findings, (5) ensuring methodological rigor, and (6) reporting the outcomes transparently. The protocol is structured according to PRISMA-P guidelines and has been registered in the PROSPERO database.;The metasynthesis is expected to provide a nuanced, combined inductive and deductive synthesis of participants' perspectives on nature-based interventions. Insights that classify and synthesize findings will inform how nature-based therapeutic interventions are experienced, what aspects are perceived as beneficial, and what contextual factors shape their effectiveness.;Metasyntheses represent a valuable method for systematically capturing the richness and complexity of qualitative primary research. By integrating experiential knowledge, patterns of meaning, and user perspectives, they can enrich and contextualize existing quantitative evidence. In the field of TCIM – particularly with complex interventions such as nature-based therapies – this complementary perspective is essential. Understanding participants’ perspectives on nature-based therapies allows for a more comprehensive picture of previously unrecognized potentials and challenges, which can and should be addressed in the development of future nature-based programs to enhance health and well-being of humans. Using qualitative metasyntheses highlights the experiential evidence necessary to advance a more comprehensive and person-centered evidence base in conjunction with quantitative reviews and metaanalyses.;"metasynthesis; Systematic Review; nature therapy; qualitative research; green spaces"

In the state of Pernambuco, Brazil, few health professionals have sought to specialize in homeopathy. Those who have chosen this specialization have been motivated by their personal experiences to explore this field, seeking solutions that can alleviate conditions without the adverse effects associated with many conventional medications. The objective of this study was to quantify the professionals who worked with homeopathy in Pernambuco, identify the medical schools (MS) where they trained, their concerns and difficulties in homeopathic clinical practice, and the pharmaceutical forms prescribed by them.;The study was a mixed method and data collection was done through the application of a questionnaire with qualitative and quantitative responses.;"Forty health professionals were interviewed, including 36 physicians, 2 dentists, and 3 veterinarians. They identified themselves as unicists (18), pluralists (17), complexists (02), and others (03), with approaches that varied according to the patient's context. The globule and liquid pharmaceutical forms were the main forms indicated by the professionals. The main difficulties reported were the short opening hours of homeopathic pharmacies, little knowledge of the population about homeopathy, low demand as a first-choice treatment, prejudice by other health professionals, attacks by laypeople and dissemination of distorted information, and resistance from the academic community to homeopathy. Another academic challenge encountered was the fact that none of the interviewees had access to the homeopathy discipline during their undergraduate studies in Pernambuco, evidencing the hegemony of the biomedical model and the invisibility of homeopathy in universities. Misinformation from fellow professionals contributes to distorted perceptions and affects patient culture, relegating homeopathy to a therapeutic resource of last resort rather than a primary option.O método Hahnemanniano é usado por 90% dos prescritores e 10% utilizam o Método Hahnemanniano e o Fluxo contínuo. Em relação às Escalas, 50% dos prescritores fazem o uso da escala centesimal (CH) e decimal (DH); 30% usam exclusivamente a escala centesimal (CH) e 12,5% as escalas centesimal (CH), decimal (DH) e a cinquenta milesimal (LM) e 7,5% usam as escalas centesimal (CH) e decimal (DH). Os prescritores que usam a escala decimal a fazem porque também tem formação profissional pela Antroposofia. ";The work highlights the need for actions to increase awareness of its foundations and benefits. This is a study with the potential to generate a positive impact on the acceptance and practice of homeopathy in Brazil, and is a tool capable of guiding actions that promote knowledge about homeopathy and its benefits. In Brazil, although homeopathy was first recognized as a medical specialty 44 years ago, none of the higher education institutions among those interviewed who graduated in Pernambuco offered the subject in their curriculum. The prescribers who had access to homeopathy during their undergraduate studies did so at universities outside the state and the country. Homeopathy remains an invisible science within universities today, given the hegemonic practice of the biomedical model.;"Homeopathy; Homeopathic Prescribers of Pernambuco; Homeopathic Prescription; "

Ligation-based therapies, particularly those integrating Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), have emerged as minimally invasive alternatives for managing internal/mixed hemorrhoids. This review aimed to map current evidence and evaluate the effectiveness of ligation techniques combined with TCM.;A literature review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving ligation-related innovative surgeries for internal/mixed hemorrhoids was done. Literature searching was conducted in PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Sinomed, Wanfang, VIP and CNKI (up to October, 2024). Risk of bias was assessed and evidence quality was evaluated using GRADE. ;"After screening 3090 records, 109 RCTs (sample size range: 30 to 756) were included. Three key comparisons were identified: 1) traditional ligation (12 RCTs) vs routine care (including Chinese medicine line in 6 RCTs); 2) conventional hemorrhoidectomy; 3) innovative techniques (involving sclerotherapy, high suspension and low incision(HSL), and herbal fumigation). TCM fumigation was primarily used in the postoperative period, with only 3 trials adopting it as the main intervention. Primary outcomes included efficacy (hemorrhoid resolution), postoperative symptoms (pain, edema), and complications (ankyloproctia).
Effectiveness and safety
Efficacy: Traditional ligation showed no significant difference (very low quality, 3 RCTs). Innovative surgery, especially HSL, significantly improved efficacy (moderate quality, 5 RCTs). Surgery combined with TCM herbal fumigation demonstrated improved efficacy (moderate quality, 2 RCTs).
Pain: Postoperative pain outcomes were heterogeneous in traditional ligation trials. For haemorrhoidectomy, there was a significant increase in pain (very low quality, 2 RCTs).
Edema: Herbal fumigation-washing significantly reduced postoperative edema incidence (moderate quality, 1 RCT).
Ankyloproctia: TCM-injection-based sclerotherapy (e.g., Fanhuang, Xiaozhiling) reduced ankyloproctia risk (moderate quality, 6 RCTs).";Ligation-based techniques, particularly those integrating TCM therapies (e.g., herbal fumigation with Sophora flavescens Aiton and Herba Houttuyniae, HSL, and Xiaozhiling sclerotherapy), offer promise for mild-to-moderate hemorrhoids. However, the low quality of evidence highlights the need for standardized RCTs with long-term outcome data. Future research should prioritize high-quality clinical trials focusing on optimal integrated TCM protocols, with systematic evaluation of long-term efficacy and adverse effects to address existing evidence gaps.;"Hemorrhoidectomy; Postoperative complications; Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM); GRADE approach"

A change of terms from Medical Rationality to Therapeutic Rationality can be justified in the transformation of medicine, which is no longer limited to a confrontational approach to disease, but embraces a broader perspective, adopting more personalized therapeutic approaches, aligned with the individual characteristics of each person.;Work developed as a narrative literature review, using the Standards for Reporting Qualitative Research: A Synthesis of Recommendations and PRISMA-P 2020 Checklist, which has been adapted.;The study established associations between the concepts of Medical Rationality and the principles underlying Complex Medical Systems. The notion of “therapeutic rationality” is used here to highlight the specific logic that guides osteopathic care, focusing on its principles, practices, and clinical reasoning. While medical rationalities include broader frameworks, this concept emphasizes osteopathy’s coherence as a distinct form of care not reducible to biomedical norms. The aim is not to create a new category, but to recognize osteopathy’s conceptual autonomy within integrative health practices. It demonstrated that Osteopathy can be coherently framed within the scope of Medical Rationality. Furthermore, it offered a critical reflection on the definitions of osteopathy and the current status of its professional regulation.;Terms, concepts and characteristics developed in this work bring osteopathy much closer to Medical Rationality and will justify the use of the term Therapeutic Rationality, recognizing the individual and unique perspective of each person.;"osteopathy; medical rationalities; integrality; therapeutic rationality"

Its main active compounds, the phytocannabinoids, interact with the human endocannabinoid system, which is involved in sleep regulation. One-third of the world’s adult population reports symptoms of insomnia, making it a common issue in healthcare systems. This potential effect of cannabis on sleep suggests its possible use in the treatment of insomnia disorder.;An integrative review was conducted using the MEDLINE and PubMed databases, covering the period from January 2014 to January 2024, with the descriptors cannabis OR cannabinoids AND insomnia OR sleep. Human studies with full texts available in English or Portuguese that addressed the use of medicinal cannabis for the treatment of insomnia were included.;The initial search yielded 383 articles, of which 26 met all inclusion criteria. The studies originated from seven countries, including two multicenter studies, and were all published in international journals in English. For detailed analysis, the studies were grouped according to methodological design. The main methodologies identified were cohort and cross-sectional studies, totaling 14 articles. Only three systematic reviews were included. Of these, one was a Canadian protocol still lacking final results at the time this review was conducted The other two systematic reviews combined evaluated more than 150 studies and highlighted that most outcomes related to cannabinoids are supported by weak evidence, mainly from observational studies or low-impact clinical trials. Three randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included. Two double-blind, placebo-controlled RCTs used standardized cannabis products and demonstrated improvements in sleep quality and duration. The third trial investigated self-reported cannabis use during a cognitive behavioral therapy protocol and found no significant impact on treatment outcomes. Observational and cross-sectional studies, which constituted the majority of the sample, mostly relied on self-reported data and involved large sample sizes. They reported improvements in quality of life, sleep quality, pain management and anxiety, as well as reduced opioid use and utilization of healthcare service. The most common forms of cannabis use reported were vaporized dry flowers, oils, tinctures, and edibles. The reviewed literature suggests that the endocannabinoid system plays a relevant role in sleep regulation and that medicinal cannabis may be a promising therapeutic option. However, there is still a lack of high-quality placebo-controlled trials in humans.;Although widely used, cannabis-based therapy still lacks robust evidence regarding its effectiveness in treating insomnia disorder. Findings indicate that phytocannabinoids may alter sleep architecture and improve sleep quality, but the predominance of observational studies highlights the need for rigorously designed clinical trials to better understand its therapeutic role, potential adverse effects, and objective sleep outcomes.;"cannabis; cannabinoids; insomnia; sleep quality"

Acupoint stimulation therapy is frequently used to treat PD. We conducted a network meta-analysis to compare the efficacy and safety of acupoint stimulation therapies based on the Korean and Chinese clinical practice guidelines for PD. ;We searched relevant studies from inception to November 1, 2024, in 10 databases including the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Embase, PubMed, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang Database, China Science and Technology Journal Database, SinoMed, KoreaMed, Korean Studies Information Service System, and Oriental Medicine Advanced Searching Integrated System. We used the Cochrane Handbook to assess the risk of bias, RevMan to perform pairwise meta-analysis, and the Netmeta package of R (4.4.2) software. ;A total of 120 studies were identified which included 9571 participants with PD. In these studies, 29 types of acupoint stimulation therapies based on Korean and Chinese clinical practice guidelines were reported. The quality of the risk of bias of the included studies was low. Based on a network meta-analysis, the top three treatments were acupoint catgut embedding (ACE) + moxibustion, warm acupuncture + acupressure, and warm acupuncture + western medicine. A visual analog scale (VAS) scores at 3 months follow-up were the highest for ACE + moxibustion, ACE + cupping, and acupressure + manual acupuncture (MA). After adjusting for prostaglandin E2 levels, the scores were highest for ACE, manual acupuncture + western medicine, and manual acupuncture + moxibustion. The result of SUCRA on prostaglandin F2? level, the top 3 were ACE + WM, MA + moxibustion, and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation.;Acupoint stimulation therapies are more advantageous than western medicine for adjusting the visual analog score at the time of treatment, at 3 months follow-up, and for adjusting prostaglandin E2 and F2?. Our findings showed that ACE + moxibustion might be best treatment solution for PD for reducing the visual analog scale scores, and ACE and ACE + western medicine might be best for reducing prostaglandins E2 or F2? levels. ;"Acupoint stimulation therapy; Systematic Review; network meta-analysis; primary dysmenorrhea"

The prescribable app M-sense Migräne includes features such as relaxation exercises, behavioral recommendations, and headache documentation to support individuals with migraine. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of M-sense Migräne in reducing migraine days.;We conducted a fully remote, two-arm, parallel-group randomized controlled trial (DRKS00024174) among adults (?18 years) in Germany diagnosed with episodic or chronic migraine. Participants were randomized 1:1 via an in-app randomization list to either the intervention group, receiving the full version of M-sense Migräne (including digital headache diary, relaxation techniques, behavioral modules, and educational content), or to a control group using a diary-only version. The primary outcome was the number of migraine days per 28-day period after 12 weeks (weeks 9–12), analyzed via ANCOVA adjusted for baseline migraine frequency and migraine type. Secondary outcomes included headache days, quality of life (HIT-6), self-efficacy (HMSE-G-SF), migraine-specific health literacy, lost productive time (HALT-30), and days with acute medication use.;"Between March and September 2021, 477 individuals were randomized (n=238 intervention, n=239 control). 476 were included in the intention-to-treat analysis (mean [SD] age, 35.2 [10.4] years; 429 [90.3%] female; mean [SD] migraine history 17.4 [10.5] years)).

Adults with EoE commonly experience dysphagia and food impaction, significantly impairing quality of life. Standard treatments, including corticosteroids, elimination diets, and endoscopic procedures can be costly and invasive. Subsequently, adults with EoE may turn to Complementary Medicine (CM). This study investigated the use, beliefs, attitudes, satisfaction, and perceived safety and efficacy of CM among adults with EoE, including the determinants of CM use.;"An international, cross-sectional online survey was conducted between May and September 2022. English-speaking adults with an endoscopy-confirmed diagnosis of EoE, residing in Australia, New Zealand, the USA, the UK, or Canada, were eligible to participate. The 33-item survey covered five domains: socio-demographics; health service and treatment utilisation; perceived efficacy and safety of treatments; and attitudes toward CM.";A total of 362 adults with EoE completed the survey. Respondents were primarily from the USA (n = 129, 35.6%) and Australia (n = 113, 31.2%). Most identified as White/Caucasian (n = 324, 89.5%) and female (n = 253, 69.9%). One-half of respondents (n = 181, 50.0%) reported using CM (consulting a CM practitioner, or using a CM therapy or product) for the management of their EoE. By percentage of population, CM use was highest in Canada (n = 33, 73.3%), followed by Australia (n = 56, 49.6%) and the USA (n = 64, 49.6%). CM practitioners most frequently consulted were naturopaths (n = 29, 8.0%), acupuncturists (n = 17, 4.7%), and massage therapists (n = 16, 4.4%). Dietitians or nutritionists were consulted by 139 (38.4%) participants. CM products were used by 151 participants (41.7%), predominantly vitamins (n = 91, 25.1%), probiotics (n = 90, 24.9%), and minerals (n = 55, 15.2%). Herbal medicines were used by 11.6% of respondents (n = 42), with the most frequently used herbs being Curcuma longa (n = 27), Zingiber officinale (n = 16), and Aloe barbadensis (n = 14). CM therapy was used by 13.0% (n = 47) of respondents, most commonly meditation (n = 28, 7.7%) and yoga (n = 14, 3.9%). Dissatisfaction with conventional care (n = 52, 14.4%) and lack of suitable treatment options (n = 51, 14.1%) were the leading reasons for CM use. The most frequently reported concerns about CMs were effectiveness (n = 86, 23.8%), practitioner training (n = 86, 23.8%), and side effects (n = 58, 16.0%). ;CM use is common among adults with EoE and seems to be largely driven by dissatisfaction with conventional care and limited availability of suitable treatment options. Although many respondents perceived CM as helpful, concerns regarding effectiveness, practitioner training, and side effects were reported. These findings highlight the need for further research to identify safe, effective and acceptable integrative approaches for EoE management.;"Eosinophilic Oesophagitis; Traditional Complementary and Integrative Medicine; efficacy; Safety; Patient Satisfaction"

Common symptoms of EoE in adults include dysphagia and food impaction, frequently contributing to reduced quality of life (QoL). Conventional management of EoE is often invasive, poorly tolerated, and expensive, with limited evidence supporting the long-term safety and efficacy of these approaches. Consequently, many individuals turn to complementary medicine (CM). Despite over 50% of adults with EoE reporting CM use, evidence of the clinical effectiveness of CM interventions for EoE remain scarce.;Following a systematic literature review, international survey, and practitioner focus groups, turmeric (Curcuma longa) was identified as a potential candidate intervention for the management of EoE in adults. A 12-week, open-label, randomised, dose-comparison pilot trial was conducted to assess the feasibility of Meriva® Curcumin Phytosome® in adults with EoE. Participants were randomised into two groups: low dose (500 mg twice daily) and medium dose (1000 mg twice daily). Primary outcomes were assessed at weeks 0, 4, 8, and 12 using the Brief Esophageal Dysphagia Questionnaire (BEDQ), Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for EoE symptom severity, EoE-QoL-A (version 2.0), and blood absolute eosinophil count (AEC).;"Seventeen of the 20 enrolled participants completed the trial (low dose group; n = 10; medium dose group; n = 7). Dysphagia symptoms (partial ETA squared [?p²] = 0.130), QoL related to EoE (?p² = 0.382), EoE symptom severity (?p² = 0.208) and AEC (?p² = 0.078), showed considerable improvement within groups over the 12 weeks. Relative to the medium-dose group, the low-dose group demonstrated a greater improvement in dysphagia symptoms (?p² = 0.036), QoL (?p² = 0.182), and EoE symptom severity (?p² = 0.049) over time, indicating that their symptoms eased. The greatest difference in the EoE related QoL between groups was seen at the week 12 timepoint, with a large effect size (?p² = 0.268) favouring the low dose group. A moderate AEC time-by-group interaction effect (?p² = 0.104) was observed, with a large between-subjects effect (?p² = 0.040) indicating the greater benefit in the medium-dose group.  Despite a larger initial drop in AEC in the low dose group when compared with the medium dose group, overall AEC increased in the low dose group and decreased in the medium dose group in the final 4 weeks of the trial period, with a large effect size (?p² = 0.154) observed between groups at the 12-week timepoint. No serious adverse events were reported.";Meriva® was found to be well-tolerated, safe and effective in improving dysphagia symptoms, EoE symptom severity, QoL and absolute eosinophil count in adults with EoE. A dose of 500 mg twice daily offered greater clinical benefit in relation to EoE-QoL, dysphagia and EoE symptom severity as compared with a 1000 mg twice daily dose. Conversely, 1000mg twice daily was found to be more effective in lowering absolute eosinophil count over 12 weeks when compared with 500mg twice daily. Findings from larger, placebo-controlled trials are now warranted to increase confidence in the certainty of this evidence.;"Eosinophilic Oesophagitis; Turmeric; herbal medicine; Safety; efficacy"

Mild to moderate COVID-19 cases represent the majority of infections and are typically managed at home with symptomatic support. However, there remains a need for interventions that could accelerate recovery and reduce symptom burden in this setting. This study evaluated the effectiveness of individualised homeopathic medicines (IHM) in improving clinical outcomes and reducing recovery time in patients with confirmed, mild to moderate COVID-19 receiving home-based care.;This was a prospective, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled exploratory trial conducted in a São Paulo municipality (Brazil) between February and July 2021. Unvaccinated adults (n=82) with RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and persistent symptoms were recruited from a public health database. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either IHM or placebo. IHM was selected for each patient based on their acute symptom totality using classical repertorisation and Materia Medica. All medicines were prepared individually (centesimal scale) and delivered in identical hydroalcoholic solutions. The placebo group received the same vehicle without active ingredient. All communication and follow-up occurred via phone. Patients self-administered 3 oral drops every 2 hours. Symptom progression was scored at each contact using a 0–72 scale derived from 24 COVID-19 symptoms (graded 0–3). Primary outcomes were time (hours) from initial appointment to medical discharge (defined as symptom resolution: score ?2 in at least two items) and reduction in symptom score over time. Statistical tests included generalised linear models, Poisson regression, and chi-square trend tests (significance: p<0.05).;"Of the 82 enrolled patients, 68 completed follow-up (32 IHM; 36 placebo). Groups were comparable at baseline in age, sex, BMI, and initial symptom scores. Mean time to medical discharge was significantly shorter in the IHM group (74.5 ± 57.47 hours; 95% CI: 55.73–93.27) compared to placebo (137.42 ± 87.85 hours; 95% CI: 106.98–167.86), with p<0.05. At 74.5 hours, the IHM group showed a lower symptom score (mean 7.31 ± 5.19) than the placebo group (11.72 ± 5.5; p<0.05). At 137.42 hours, the IHM group continued to show a significantly lower score (2.83 ± 2.79 vs. 5.09 ± 4.78; p<0.05). These findings suggest that IHM led to faster symptom relief and earlier clinical recovery. The difference was consistent across time points and reinforces the potential effectiveness of individualised prescriptions in acute epidemic contexts.";Individualised homeopathic medicines significantly reduced time to recovery and symptom intensity in mild to moderate COVID-19 managed at home, compared to placebo. The findings highlight the potential role of classical homeopathy as an adjunct therapeutic option in public health emergencies. Further studies with larger samples are warranted to confirm and expand upon these results.;"Homeopathy; PROSPECTIVE CLINICAL TRIAL; COVID-19"

Severe cases may signal an elevated risk of endometriosis—a chronic, hormone-dependent inflammatory disease that remains underdiagnosed, often for many years. The MeMaF project (Menstrual health and hybrid care Model for all young Females), developed and implemented in Germany, addresses this care gap. It aims to relieve menstrual pain and to identify and treat girls and young women with a high risk of endometriosis at an early stage through a hybrid, integrative, and interdisciplinary care model.;"MeMaF is a two-stage Innovation Fund project led by Charité – Universitätsmedizin Berlin, in collaboration with statutory health insurers (BARMER, TK, DAK), the Hasso Plattner Institute, and digital and clinical partners (Registration No. DRKS00033614).

• Stage 1 (nVF-1): A digital intervention delivered via the app period., which includes cycle and symptom tracking, educational content, and integrative self-care tools such as yoga, aroma self-massage, and acupressure. This stage is evaluated in a prospective observational study with 3,000 participants.

• Stage 2 (nVF-2): A nested randomized controlled trial (n = 220) targeting participants identified as high-risk for the development of endometriosis. It involves interdisciplinary, multimodal care including extended ultrasound, personalized medical counseling, pelvic physiotherapy, nutritional guidance, and psychological support—complemented by digital tools.";"During the implementation of the MeMaF project, a key challenge was the development of a hybrid care model that meets clinical, financial, technical, and organizational requirements. A major task was the simultaneous development of technical and clinical infrastructures to support both care delivery and study operations. The first stage of care was successfully realized as a fully digital app-based model, offering low-threshold and widely accessible integrative self-care and monitoring. The second stage was designed as a clinical, interdisciplinary program with direct linkage to the digital components of nVF-1 through the period.app and centralized evaluation structures.
Reaching the target of recruiting 3,000 participants for nVF-1 and 220 for nVF-2 required tailored strategies to effectively engage the adolescent and young adult female population. Dependencies on external service providers posed risks of delays and unforeseen complications. Nevertheless, successful strategies included strong interdisciplinary collaboration, flexible project management, and the application of professional communication expertise—particularly in outreach and public engagement. The full recruitment target for nVF-1 has already been achieved.";Initial insights from the German MeMaF project indicate that a hybrid model combining digital platforms with integrative self-care and interdisciplinary support may be a feasible and acceptable strategy to support menstrual health in young women. While full results from clinical and economic evaluations are pending, the model holds promise for broader implementation and adaptation in international contexts. Integrative therapies such as yoga, acupressure, and aroma self-massage may serve as valuable components in holistic menstrual care frameworks.;"dysmenorrhea; Endometriosis; Integrative Medicine"

We compared the effectiveness of three different dietary treatment plans (G1-FM-low FODMAP diet, G2-IP IgG based elimination-rotation- diet, and as control group, the G3-K control diet recommended by an attending gastroenterologist) in treating patients diagnosed with mixed irritable bowel syndrome.;A total of seventy-three female patients diagnosed with a mixed form of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-M) were enrolled in the study. The diet of each patient in Group 1 (G1-FM) and 2 (G2-IP) was determined individually during a meeting with a dietitian. To determine the individualized G2-IP IgG based elimination-rotation- diet each patient was tested for specific IgG to 270 different foods. Patients from Group 3 (G3-K) received nutrition advice from a gastroenterologist. All diet plans were adjusted to an energy value of 1800–2300 kcal. Duration of the trial: 8 weeks.;"Significant differences in the reduction of IBS symptoms were found between the groups. IBS symptoms as well as comorbid symptoms such as headache/migraine, skin condition, constant tiredness or weakness significantly improved or disappeared completely in the G2-IP group (idiopathic abdominal pain, p < 0.001; abdominal pain after a meal, p < 0.001; abdominal pain during defecation, p = 0.008), while in the G1-FM group,  only some of the IBS symptoms significantly improved (mucus in stool, p = 0.031; bloating, p < 0.001). In group G3-K no significant improvement was seen. In addition, the G2-IP IgG based elimination-rotation- diet showed improved supply for mono- and poly-unsaturated fatty acids, fibers, vitamin A, D and E, Magnesium, iron and iodine and decreased supply for cholesterol, carbohydrates compared to the Fodmap diet. The G2-IP IgG based elimination-rotation- diet showed improvements in 86% of the cases compared to 38% in the Fodmap diet.";Based on the results of this open-label study, it was concluded that various dietary interventions in the treatment of IBS-M patients do not uniformly affect the course and outcomes of disease management.

In Brazil, acupuncture is recognized as a nursing specialty and includes systemic needling, auriculotherapy/auricular acupuncture, moxibustion, and cupping therapy. The aim of this study was to explore the guiding aspects of the nursing process in acupuncture practice, with the purpose of disseminating robust evidence to support the safe and high-quality delivery of acupuncture care by nurses. ;"This is an integrative literature review, structured around the steps of problem identification and guiding question formulation, use of search strategies with defined inclusion and exclusion criteria, followed by selection, analysis, and interpretation of data. The search for evidence was conducted in April 2025 using the following databases via their respective scientific portals: LILACS through the Virtual Health Library; PubMed, SciELO, Scopus, Web of Science, and CINAHL via the Federated Academic Community (CAFe) of CAPES/Brazil, and supplemented by Google Scholar and documents from health authorities. The methodological quality of the selected publications was not assessed.";"A total of seven publications were included, categorized into the following themes: implementation of the nursing process directed at acupuncture practice and the need to incorporate knowledge of PICS into nursing education. The evidence demonstrated the importance of structuring acupuncture practice around the following aspects of the nursing process during the initial consultation: integrative data assessment (tongue observation, appearance and posture, pulse palpation, and identification of painful or sensitive points; energy inspection), as well as other subjective and objective data integrated with Western clinical reasoning; formulation of nursing diagnoses and clinical diagnosis based on TCM patterns of energy imbalance; planning of care centered on patient needs with defined goals and expected outcomes; therapeutic decision-making; and implementation of optimal acupuncture interventions, including point selection, techniques, and frequently anchored in individualized nursing care, interprofessional collaboration, and health programs. In follow-up consultations, the nursing process is applied in acupuncture practice through nursing progress notes that include the evaluation of treatment effectiveness, reassessment of integrative and complementary health data, redefinition of energy and nursing diagnoses when necessary, adjustments to the comprehensive care plan, and decisions regarding the continuation of therapeutic intervention.The main limitation identified was the small number of studies included. Further implementation and methodological studies on care protocols, adapted to both local and global contexts, are recommended to support and refine the application of the nursing process in acupuncture practice.";Best practices in acupuncture performed by nurses should be guided by a nursing process aligned with scientific evidence, the specificities of this therapeutic approach, and diverse socio-environmental contexts. Moreover, this knowledge should be introduced early in nursing education. ;"Acupuncture Therapy; Nursing Process; Complementary Therapies"

mental health and psychological well-being. While anecdotal evidence and popular media suggest
potential benefits for reducing stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms, the scientific evidence
supporting these claims remains fragmented. This protocol outlines the methodology for a systematic
review and meta-analysis aiming to critically appraise and synthesize the available evidence on the
effects of CWE on mental health outcomes in adult populations, including both healthy individuals and
those with clinical conditions. The review will examine both psychological variables and physiological
stress markers in response to cold-water exposure interventions.";"The overarching aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to synthesize the effect of CWE on mental health outcomes in adult populations (18 years or older, healthy and clinical population). The primary objective is to assess the effects of CWE on key mental health outcomes, specifically depressive symptoms, anxiety, perceived stress, and general mental well-being, by pooling effect sizes from available studies using validated psychometric instruments. The secondary objective is to investigate the effects of CWE on broader psychological and physiological variables associated with mental health, including sleep quality, thermoregulatory (e.g., core body temperature, skin temperature), metabolic responses, and neurobiological markers such as cortisol, norepinephrine, and inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-6, TNF-? or C-reactive protein (CRP)). CWE is defined as full-body or chest-level immersion (?25°C), ice baths, cold showers and recreational open-water winter swimming. Any control (e.g. placebo, usual care) serves as comparison. Therefore, following PRIMSA 2020 guidelines, a systematic search will be conducted in PubMed, PsycINFO, Embase, and Web of Science. Eligible
studies will include randomized controlled trials, controlled clinical trials without randomization, cohort studies, and case-control studies. Risk of bias will be assessed using RoB1 for randomized controlled trials, ROBINS-I for non-randomized intervention studies, and ROBINS-E for observational studies. Random-effects meta-analyses will be conducted where sufficient data are available. ";"The review will provide a structured quantitative synthesis of cold-water exposure’s effects on mental
health, helping to bridge the gap between popular claims and empirical evidence.";The findings will inform future research, public health guidelines, and the development of safe and effective cold-water exposure protocols for clinical and wellness applications.;"cold-water exposure; mental health; stress reduction; Anxiety; Depression"

Findings from MADDY RCT;The Micronutrients for ADHD in Youth (MADDY) study investigated a multinutrient intervention (vitamins, essential minerals and antioxidants) to treat symptoms of ADHD and emotional dysregulation. In this report, we examined the outcome measures of psychometric tools from clinician rating, parent reporting, or clinician elicited from parents, compared by treatment groups.;"Children aged 6 to 12 with ADHD and emotional dysregulation were randomized to a multinutrient product or placebo for 8 weeks. Blinded outcome measures included: 1) the clinician rated Clinical Global Impression (CGI); 2) parent reported Child and Adolescent Symptom Inventor-5 (CASI-5) and Strength and Development Questionnaire (SDQ), 3) clinician elicited Parent Targeted Problem (PTP) and Pediatrics Adverse Events Scale (PAERS). ";"Of 135 enrolled in the trial, data from 126 children were included in the intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis. Clinician rated CGI-I categorized responders (CGI-I<3) were 54% in the multinutrients group vs. 18% placebo (Cramer’s V=0.37, p<0.001). The parent-reported CASI-5 composite scores did not differ between groups (p=0.70); both groups improved from baseline (p<0.01). Parent reported SDQ was not significantly different by group for total difficulties (p=0.63); both improved from baseline to end of RCT (p<0.01), trend for greater improvement for all subscales of the SDQ in the multinutrient group compared to the placebo group.

The average of all PTPs (1 & 2) was also significantly (p=.05) better for micronutrients (3.85) than for placebo (4.25). PAERS analysis revealed micronutrient group to have a greater overall improvement in the combined score than the placebo group with a between-group difference in change of –0.36 (95% CI: -0.67, -0.04; p=0.03) with ITT data and –0.48 (95% CI: -0.81, -0.15; p=0.005) with per-protocol data.";"Comparisons of psychometric tools found dissimilar outcomes by reporter of the measure. Clinicians’ rated outcomes showed higher proportion of responders in the multinutrient group compared to placebo while parent reported outcomes found improvement of overall symptoms from baseline to end of RCT but no difference between groups. Clinician elicited outcomes found symptom specific changes differed by group.

Measures of efficacious and safety of a multinutrient treatment for children with ADHD showed dissimilar results if provided by clinician rating vs. parental report vs. conferred outcomes. Thus, future research of TCIM interventions should consider the type of outcome measures used to evaluate treatment efficacy.";"multinutrients; RCT; outcome measures"

These abnormalities significantly increase the risk of cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and all-cause mortality. Women undergoing the menopausal transition are particularly vulnerable to MetS due to hormonal fluctuations that promote adverse metabolic changes. In this context, identifying effective interventions to prevent or mitigate these alterations is essential. Yoga has emerged as a promising traditional and complementary practice for improving metabolic parameters in diverse populations. This study evaluated the effects of a structured Shivam Yoga training program over 6, 12, and 24 months on the prevalence of MetS and its individual components in this population.;This longitudinal study enrolled sedentary women aged 40–65 years diagnosed with metabolic syndrome (MetS) in Ouro Preto, Brazil. Participants were randomly assigned to either a yoga intervention group or a control group. The intervention consisted of twice-weekly, 60-minute standardized Shivam Yoga sessions for up to 24 months, while women in the control group maintained their usual activities. Biochemical (fasting glucose, triglycerides, HDL-c), anthropometric (waist circumference), and blood pressure measurements were collected at baseline and follow-up visits. Assessments were conducted at baseline and at 6-, 12-, and 24-month follow-ups. Statistical analyses included both parametric and non-parametric tests, with significance set at 5%.;"A total of 102 sedentary women aged 45–60 years with MetS were assigned to either a Shivam Yoga intervention or a control group. However, 76, 57, and 37 participants completed the 6-, 12-, and 24-month follow-ups, respectively. The frequency of MetS significantly decreased in the Yoga group compared to the Control group at 6 months (–20.8%; p = 0.028) and 24 months (–46.0%; p = 0.007). Intragroup analysis revealed a 73.3% reduction in MetS frequency in the Yoga group at 24 months (p = 0.001). Glucose levels significantly decreased in the Yoga group at all time points: 6 (–9.66 mg/dL; p = 0.034), 12 (–11.61 mg/dL; p = 0.041), and 24 months (–21.54 mg/dL; p = 0.001). At 24 months, improvements were also observed in HDL cholesterol (+20 mg/dL vs. Control; p = 0.001), waist circumference (–7.40 cm; p = 0.003), and both systolic (–19.40 mmHg; p = 0.005) and diastolic blood pressure (–10.93 mmHg; p = 0.009). Triglyceride levels remained unchanged across groups and time points (p > 0.05).";"Long-term practice of Shivam Yoga significantly improved the metabolic profile of climacteric women with MetS. The structured program reduced MetS prevalence and improved key clinical parameters, supporting its potential as a sustainable, low-cost, non-pharmacological strategy for managing MetS and preventing chronic disease in this population.

LAGOM is a tailored prevention program that combines behavioral and structural prevention with a focus on mind-body medicine (MBM). Following the evaluation of LAGOM in a feasibility study (DRKS00032014) and in an ongoing pragmatic randomised controlled trial (DRKS00034060), this longitudinal open cohort study aims to generate real-world evidence on the implementation and long-term effectiveness of the LAGOM program in a university hospital setting. Conducted as an independent scientific evaluation, this study aims to support the integration of LAGOM into workplace health promotion initiatives at the Charité – Universitätsmedizin Berlin.;"Methods: This longitudinal open cohort study comprises two cohorts. The first cohort includes all hospital employees who will participate in LAGOM in 2025-2027. It will be complemented by a comparison cohort of hospital employees who do not participate in LAGOM. From this second cohort, a comparison group will be selected using propensity score matching based on key sociodemographic and occupational characteristics (e.g., occupational status, years of experience, working hours). Inclusion criteria for both cohorts include provision of written informed consent and current employment with direct patient contact in a hospital setting. Participation in the LAGOM program is restricted to working hours.

LAGOM is a structured nine-week programme designed to prevent burnout. Sessions take place weekly, alternating between on-site and online, and are offered to fixed groups of up to 15 participants. The course incorporates elements of MBM, as well as behavioural and structural prevention strategies. 

Measurement time points will include assessments at baseline before LAGOM (week 0), immediately after LAGOM (week 10) and at a follow-up visit 6 months after the program. Data collection will include psychological (burnout symptoms, measured using the Burnout Assessment Tool, BAT), stress (measured using the Perceived Stress Scale, PSS-10), well-being (WHO-5)) and stress-related physiological measures (diurnal cortisol profiles, heart rate variability (HRV)). A health economic evaluation will be conducted to assess the program’s cost-effectiveness from an operational perspective, considering both direct and indirect intervention costs. The primary economic outcomes absenteeism and presenteeism will be measured using the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire - General Health (WPAI:GH). In addition, job satisfaction and turnover intention will be assessed as further indicators of organisational benefits. The LAGOM program will be evaluated for the purpose of continuous program adaptation based on participants’ feedback.";"Results: This is ongoing work, and no results are available yet.

Discussion: In addition to providing feasibility and effectiveness data, this study aims to generate long-term real-world data on the impact of the LAGOM program, with a particular focus on improving employee mental health and well-being. Long-term data, including health economic assessments and laboratory-based markers, are important for evaluating the program’s sustainable integration into workplace health promotion. The study will be submitted to the Charité Ethics Committee and registered on drks.de. The results will be disseminated to the scientific community through peer-reviewed journals and to the general public via press releases.";-;"Mind-body medicine; Burnout Prevention; Workplace Health Promotion; HealthEconomics; Healthcare"

Response adaptive randomization (RAR), a dynamic randomization method, not only benefits from clinical research, but also meets the requirement of medical ethics. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) emphasize personalized diagnosis and treatment, while RAR can more flexibly adapt to patient responses. The perceptions and experiences of participants on randomization methods use are unknown. The existing study of RAR method is scarce. This study is designed to investigate the understanding and application of randomization methods among clinicians and researchers engaged in methodology and drug development, explore their perception on challenges of traditional randomization methods, advantages and potential clinical application scenarios of RAR method, and provide advice for future application.;A questionnaire survey was conducted among clinicians and researchers engaged in methodology and drug development, covering basic information, cognitive, clinical practice, and suggestions. Then some of the participants were selected to receive semi-structured interviews. Interview transcripts were analyzed using NVivo 11 software for qualitative data analysis, employing thematic analysis to identify challenges in randomization methods and explore potential scenarios and challenges for RAR application.;Thirty valid questionnaires were collected. Almost all clinicians and researchers engaged in methodology and drug development were familiar with traditional randomization methods (29 [96.67%]). The challenges of traditional randomization methods included difficulty in recruitment, patient treatment preferences, poor compliance, ethical dilemmas in critical trials, which could limit benefits for placebo groups, and unbalance covariates. Over half of respondents (23 [76.67%]) recognized the potential of RAR to optimize allocation and align with ethical requirements, though most lacked practical experience due to the absence of standardized guidelines and mature platforms. The application of RAR methods has drawn great attention, while the majority of respondents (25 [83.33%]) reported no experience in clinical practice. The challenges of RAR method included insufficient clinical researches on RAR method (25 [83.33%]), the absence of unified standardized guidelines for implementation (25 [83.33%]), and a lack of mature RAR platform (24 [80.0%]). The Semi-structured interviews identified four main themes: understanding and clinical experience of randomization methods, current challenges in randomization, advantages and clinical scenarios for RAR method, and recommendations and potential challenges for RAR promotion. Compared with traditional randomization methods, RAR method was more flexible in clinical trials, allowing participants to be assigned to a better treatment, which could save samples, improve recruitment efficiency, and apply to complicated clinical scenarios. Future studies should thoroughly investigate RAR method through carrying out well-designed researches, providing clinical cases, and developing methodological consensus and guidelines.;Clinicians and researchers engaged in methodology and drug development were familiar with the characteristics, advantages, and challenges of traditional randomization methods. The RAR method demonstrates significant advantages in TCM clinical researches, particularly in screening different TCM prescriptions under the same pattern differentiation, determining optimal dosages for the same prescription, and identifying the most effective among multiple candidate regimens. RAR method has attracted great attention for its clinical and ethical value. Future studies are supposed to fully explore RAR method, and promoting its application in TCM clinical reasearch. ;"Randomization; response adaptive randomization; understanding; application"

Health professionals as Pharmacists and nutritionist part of this project promoted an educational action about hypertension on April, 26th, 2025. The objective of this work is to survey the blood pressure of community participants, classify them and promote an educational talk on hypertension.  The lecture subjects was Hypertension, what are the risks factors, classification of the blood pressure, conventional treatment and the consequences of this clinical condition. The lecture as well demonstrated 5 medicinal plants (Garlic, Celery, Green tea, Burrito and Ginseng) that helps in the hypertension treatment with scientific support.;The lecture was presented with data show for 32 people, mainly women with more than 35 years old. No treatment was applied  before evaluation of the blood pressure (BP). All participants had the BP measured with a sphygmomanometer by health professionals. Everyone was seated and relaxed for 15 minutes before the measurement. The results of the blood pressure of the participants were discussed with the community.;From the 32 participants only 12 was with the blood pressure classified as normal (? 120 mmHg / ? 80mmHg). 3 of them was classified as prehypertension (130 – 139 mmHg / 85 – 89 mmHg) and 17 was with blood pressure classified as hypertension. 10 of them in stage 1 (140 – 159 mmHg / 90 – 99 mmHg), 3 of them in stage 2 (160 – 179 mmHg / 100 – 109 mmHg) and 4 participants was with blood pressure in stage 3 of hypertension (? 180 mmHg / ? 110 mmHg). 8 people knew they were hypertensive and still had high blood pressure. Only one participant that is hypertensive were with normal blood pressure during this intervention.;Even with technological advances and more information in the health area, it can be noted that needy communities still suffer with lack of support and information. This education action was well received by the community.

Codes were inductively grouped into themes, with discrepancies resolved through team discussion.;-;;Access and Decision-Making for TCM Health Information via Social Media in Older Adults: A Qualitative In-Depth Interview;Older adults increasingly seek Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) advice online, yet their age-related limitations and the fragmented quality of social-media content complicate safe, informed decision-making. Current evidence on how this population navigates mobile platforms for TCM knowledge is scarce. We therefore explored the status, drivers, barriers and unmet needs surrounding older adults’ access to—and subsequent use of—TCM health information delivered via mobile social media.;"A qualitative design employing semi-structured interviews was adopted. Forty-four community-dwelling adults aged ? 65 years from Beijing, Jiangsu and Fujian were recruited via convenience sampling. Interviews (face-to-face or video) followed a seven-question guide, were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and anonymised. A six-step reflexive thematic analysis was conducted by a multidisciplinary team; codes were inductively clustered into sub-themes, themes and overarching domains, with disagreements resolved by discussion.";"Interviews with 44 older adults generated approximately 30 hours of audio and 330 000 Chinese characters of transcript, yielding 94 codes grouped into eight themes across three domains:current status, related factors, and needs.

Current status—Participants engaged in information-seeking behaviours, preferring disease-management and health-maintenance content in video, text, and audio formats from platforms they habitually used or trusted sources like professional TCM practitioners. They also demonstrated decision-making behaviours, including sharing posts, recording prescriptions, purchasing supplements and consulting TCM practitioners. Resultant influences were both beneficial (enhanced self-care, symptom relief) and detrimental (financial burden, information overload). 

Related factors—Positive drivers included strong health needs, cultural identification with TCM and trust in authoritative sources. Convenient access to mobile platforms further enhanced older adults' receptivity to digital health messages. However, negative factors such as physical limitations (e.g., declining vision), limited digital literacy, questionable information credibility and over commercialized content diminished their enthusiasm and trust. Neutral factors, including economic considerations and differing family interests, subtly influenced their decisions.

Needs—Older adults expressed clear unmet needs: they desired higher quality, comprehensible, and easily navigable information, emphasizing practical knowledge such as chronic disease management and emotional health support. Technological expectations included senior-friendly interfaces with enlarged fonts, simplified navigation, and enhanced voice-based search functions. They also expressed interest in integrating artificial intelligence tools to facilitate symptom assessment, virtual tele-consultations, and coherent online–offline healthcare coordination. Policy-related expectations called for stricter regulation to combat misinformation and preserve TCM traditions.

These findings align with global trends showing older adults' growing reliance on digital media, but highlight specific cultural contexts influencing their TCM-related preferences and decision-making patterns, underscoring the need for targeted interventions to enhance older adults’ digital health literacy and TCM engagement. ";Older adults exhibit active but cautious engagement with mobile-mediated TCM information. Addressing credibility concerns, technological usability and policy support could enhance safe uptake and informed decision-making. Future studies should include populations from diverse economic and cultural backgrounds, evaluate hybrid online–offline models, and conduct longitudinal studies on evolving usage patterns.;"Older adults; Traditional Chinese Medicine; social media; Health-information seeking; Qualitative study"

factors influenced by the environment. This challenges the deterministic view of the genome, showing that
gene activity can be deeply modulated by external signals and an individuals subjective perception.
Epigenetics emerges as the bridge between genetic code and environmental input, allowing life experiences,
emotional patterns, diet, stress, and exposure to energetic fields to dynamically shape gene expression.
Mechanisms such as DNA methylation, histone modification, and the action of non-coding RNAs form a
plastic interface between external stimuli and internal biology. Pioneering studies by Moshe Szyf and Michael
Meaney demonstrated that environmental influences can induce stable epigenetic changes affecting behavior
and physiology across generationseven without mutations in DNA sequences.";"This article is based on a critical review of multidisciplinary scientific literature, including both classical and
contemporary sources on epigenetics, vibrational medicine, cellular biocommunication, and pharmacognosy.
The analysis focused on research investigating how natural compounds and subtle stimulisuch as biophotons
and low-frequency electromagnetic fieldsaffect gene expression, cellular metabolism, and DNA integrity.
Authors like Fritz-Albert Popp, Bruce Lipton, Martin Blank, and Reba Goodman served as references to map
how vibrational signals can modulate molecular pathways. The article also explores studies on the impact of
contemplative practices and adaptogenic medicinal plants on epigenetic regulation and the
neuro-immuno-endocrine axis.
";"The findings reveal a growing interconnection between genetics, consciousness, and subtle energy fields.
Bioactive compounds such as curcumin, resveratrol, and silymarin exhibit epigenetic properties by regulating
key enzymes like histone deacetylases and DNA methyltransferases. These effects include silencing
pro-inflammatory genes, reactivating tumor suppressor genes, and restoring dysregulated physiological
systems. Additionally, biophoton emissionsultra-weak photons emitted by cells, especially DNAare emerging
as a form of intracellular communication and biological coherence. These emissions shift under oxidative
stress and may be modulated through meditation and antioxidant herbal therapies. ELF-MF (extremely low
frequency magnetic fields), even at non-thermal levels, have been shown to alter DNA structure, enhance
transcriptional activity, and activate stress-responsive genes such as HSP70. Together, these insights
suggest that the cell functions as a sensitive bioelectronic unitreceiving and transmitting information beyond
traditional biochemical pathways.
";"The convergence of genetics, epigenetics, vibrational fields, and herbal medicine signals a silent revolution in
medical science. The human body, viewed as a dynamic informational field, can be restored and rebalanced
through subtle interventions that resonate with its original biological signature. Therapeutic models
incorporating these elements hold promise for more personalized, effective, and non-invasive approaches to
health. Acknowledging the role of non-material factors in biological regulation is not a departure from science,
but an expansiontoward a holistic vision of health rooted in the interplay of energy, information, and matter.

A rat model of muscle spasm in M and T groups was established via exercise-induced fatigue (EIF), adopting a moderate exercise intensity on the treadmill for two weeks. Kneading manipulation was administered in the T group for 7 consecutive days, and using a massage manipulation simulator on the BL57 acupoint with a force of 4N, 60 times per minute, for a total of 5 minutes.  Pain threshold was assessed by mechanical withdrawal threshold (MWT) and thermal withdrawal latency (TWL). Hemorheological parameters were measured to evaluate blood viscosity. Expression levels of lactic acid (LA) and urea nitrogen (BUN) were quantified by biochemical assays. The ultrastructure of gastrocnemius muscle was observed under a transmission electron microscope. Metabolomic profiling of gastrocnemius muscle was conducted using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS).;Compared with the M group, both MWT and TWL in the T group were significantly higer, the oscillation frequency (F), the blood viscosity, plasma viscosity, and the levels of LA and BUN were significantly  lower. The electron microscopy showed that myofibrils in the T group were arranged more orderly than M group, with clearer light and dark bands, and increased mitochondria. The metabolomics results showed that there were 136 differential metabolites between the T and M groups, mainly involving in glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway, inositol metabolism, and lipid metabolism.;Chinese tuina therapy can effectively alleviate skeletal muscle spasm?as well as pain and circulatory disorders caused by muscle spasm.

The possibility that biophotonic signaling could influence epigenetic states is a novel topic of growing scientific interest. This systematic review aims to synthesize evidence on the interplay between biophoton emission and epigenetic modulation, focusing on cell signaling and genomic plasticity.

";"A systematic review was conducted according to PRISMA guidelines, searching PubMed, Scielo, and Google Scholar for studies published between January 2000 and March 2024. Search terms included ""biophoton"", ""ultra-weak photon emission"", ""epigenetics"", ""gene expression"", and ""photobiomodulation"". Inclusion criteria: (1) peer-reviewed original articles or reviews; (2) studies reporting on biophoton emission and/or epigenetic regulation in response to physical, electromagnetic, or photobiological stimuli. Exclusion: case reports, non-peer-reviewed sources, or non-English articles. Study quality was assessed with the GRADE system. Data extracted included sample type, methodology, measurement techniques, and main findings.";"A total of 284 records were identified; after removal of duplicates and screening, 37 articles met inclusion criteria.
Biophoton emission: 22 studies quantified biophoton emission in vitro or in vivo. Most demonstrated increased emission in response to oxidative stress, cell damage, or external stimuli (e.g., low-level light therapy).
Epigenetic modulation: 15 studies analyzed gene expression and epigenetic marks (DNA methylation, histone acetylation) following exposure to light or electromagnetic fields. Several found modulation of gene expression associated with changes in methylation status and chromatin remodeling.
Link between biophotons and epigenetics: No study directly demonstrated a mechanistic link, but several hypothesize that biophotons may act as signaling molecules affecting gene regulatory networks.
Therapeutic implications: A minority of studies report beneficial effects of low-intensity light exposure on cell proliferation, differentiation, and gene activation. However, results are inconsistent, and clinical translation remains limited.
Current evidence suggests a potential, though not yet fully elucidated, relationship between biophoton emission and the regulation of epigenetic mechanisms. While biophotons are confirmed as indicators of cellular state and possible mediators of cell-cell signaling, direct causality between biophoton flux and epigenetic remodeling has not been established. Methodological limitations include small sample sizes, heterogeneity in experimental protocols, lack of standardization in biophoton detection, and limited in vivo data. Most included studies are exploratory, with moderate to low methodological quality (GRADE rating: low-moderate).
Limitations:
This review is narrative in nature, based on published literature, and does not include meta-analysis or original data. The evidence is exploratory, and all claims should be interpreted with caution.";This review highlights an emerging interface between photobiology and epigenetics, where biophoton-mediated cellular communication may influence genomic plasticity. While current evidence is preliminary and primarily correlative, the results support further investigation into the mechanisms and therapeutic potential of biophoton and photobiomodulation-based interventions. High-quality, controlled studies are essential to clarify causality and assess clinical applications.;"biophotons; Epigenetics; Photobiology; Cell signaling; gene expression"

Offered free of charge, the course is self-paced and available via the Fiocruz (Research Institute linked to the Brazilian Ministry of Health) Virtual Campus. Its primary objective is to disseminate foundational knowledge on human physiology, emotional well-being, sleep, breathing, and meditation. The course comprises six theoretical modules and twenty-two practical sessions grounded in Yoga, meditation, and Somatic Education methodologies. In addition to serving as a self-care resource for stress management, the course functions as a continuing education initiative, supporting both individual and group participation with flexible sequencing, duration, and practice combinations. This study presents an evaluation of the course’s initial three months of implementation using the RE-AIM framework.";Participants are invited to complete pre- and post-intervention questionnaires to assess self-efficacy, risk of common mental disorders, sleep quality, stress, anxiety, depression, knowledge acquisition, and overall satisfaction. RE-AIM was used for detailed implementation analysis focusing on reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation and manteinance. The statistical tests used were: Chi-square, T-test and Paired t-test.;"The course demonstrated satisfactory reach, with statistical analyses based on 222 baseline and 68 follow-up questionnaires. The majority of participants identified as women (79.73% at baseline and 77% at follow-up), were single (54.05% and 67.65%), held higher education degrees (74.33% and 64.71%), and reported household incomes of up to five minimum wages (64.86% and 77.94%). HP comprised 47.3% of the initial sample and 39.71% of the final sample.
Effectiveness was evidenced by reductions in the proportion of participants at risk for common mental disorders (from 43.69% to 30.88%), as well as in severe cases of anxiety (from 21.12% to 12.94%), depression (from 16.21% to 10.94%), and stress (from 27.93% to 16.18%). Statistically significant improvements were observed in self-efficacy (p ? 0.01) and knowledge acquisition (p ? 0.01). Although the proportion of participants reporting dissatisfaction with sleep increased (from 26.66% to 42.65%), mean comparisons suggested a trend toward improved sleep quality (p = 0.07). 
Adoption indicators were promising: 91.18% of participants considered the information useful and easy to understand; 88.24% approved of the practical components; 91.18% reported improved emotional regulation; and 85.29% indicated that the knowledge gained was beneficial in addressing daily challenges. Key implementation challenges included technical difficulties with the online platform and insufficient funding for outreach activities. Maintenance strategies have involved social media dissemination and in-person workshops for course promotion targeting HP.";The RE-AIM-based evaluation revealed the course’s effectiveness in enhancing mental health outcomes and high levels of participant approval. To expand its reach among HP, including CHW, sustained outreach efforts and institutional coordination are essential. Future quantitative and qualitative evaluations will be critical in identifying barriers, enablers, and opportunities for refinement to strengthen the course’s role as a practical intervention for self-care and the promotion of collective health and well-being.;"Self Care; self-management; mental health; Meditation; Heath Education"

Modern medical approaches primarily employ antibiotics, antiviral agents, and glucocorticoids for treatment. However, clinical challenges persist, including antibiotic overuse , bacterial resistance, and gastrointestinal complications .
In traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), pediatric pneumonia falls under the category of Feiyan Chuansou (panting and coughing due to pneumonia). TCM demonstrates significant advantages in clinical treatment, post-illness recovery, and alleviation of adverse reactions in pediatric pneumonia.
This in vitro study aims to investigate the effects and mechanisms of Yinlai Decoction (YLD)-containing serum on 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) synthesis and secretion in a RIN-14B cell model of gastrointestinal heat accumulation (GHA)-complicated pneumonia, and to explore the experimental mechanisms underlying YLD’s therapeutic efficacy against GHA-complicated pneumonia.";The drug-containing serum of YLD was prepared via intragastric administration of YLD to Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. A rat model of gastrointestinal heat accumulation (GHA) complicated with pneumonia was established using a high-calorie diet combined with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) nebulization, and the model group serum was subsequently collected. The normal group serum was obtained from rats fed a standard diet and administered saline intragastrically. The effects of serum from different groups on RIN-14B cell viability were assessed using the CCK-8 assay. To replicate the in vitro cell model of GHA-complicated pneumonia, RIN-14B cells were stimulated with model group serum. Cells were divided into six experimental groups: control (untreated), normal (normal serum-treated), model (model serum-treated), YLD (YLD serum-treated), TPH1 inhibitor (LP-533401 hydrochloride-treated), and YLD + TPH1 inhibitor (co-treated with YLD serum and LP-533401 hydrochloride). The expression of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) was quantified using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Western blot analysis was performed to evaluate the protein levels of 5-HT synthesis-related markers (STAT5, pSTAT5 [Tyr694], TPH1) and secretion-related markers (TRPA1, TRPC4).;ELISA results demonstrated that compared with the normal group, the 5-HT level in the model group was significantly decreased (P < 0.01). In contrast, the 8% YLD group exhibited a marked increase in 5-HT levels compared to the model group (P < 0.01). Western blot analysis revealed that the protein expression of STAT5, pSTAT5 (Tyr694), TPH1, TRPA1, and TRPC4 in the model group was significantly reduced compared to the normal group (P < 0.01). Compared with the model group, the YLD group showed significantly elevated expression of STAT5, pSTAT5 (Tyr694), TPH1, and TRPC4 (P < 0.01 or P < 0.05), while TRPA1 expression displayed an upward trend without statistical significance. Additionally, compared to the TPH1 inhibitor group, the YLD + TPH1 inhibitor group exhibited significantly increased protein levels of TPH1, TRPA1, and TRPC4 (P < 0.05).;YLD enhances STAT5 protein expression and promotes its phosphorylation in the GHA-complicated pneumonia cell model, thereby upregulating TPH1 expression and facilitating 5-HT synthesis. Furthermore, YLD increases TRPA1 and TRPC4 protein expression, promoting 5-HT secretion.;"Yinlai Decoction; Drug-containing serum; Gastrointestinal heat accumulation; Pediatric pneumonia; 5-Hydroxytryptamine"

It was also evident that the terms/descriptors associated with interculturality in health – most of them typical of the region of the Americas – are not standardized or are grouped into standardized words that, together with their definitions, do not apply or fit all ethnic populations; in addition, that clinical evidence is scarce and not necessarily well cataloged, this being a field still under construction in public health.
";"Preliminarily, we propose that most of the studies carried out in the field of public health seek to evidence interventions of specific pathologies in populations but not by adherence to models or health systems of ethnic or intercultural origin; that an ethnic and social approach is needed in health interventions and that we must transcend the normative, conceptual and hospital adequacy, to make effective the adequacy of existing health systems that articulate traditional medicines with allopathic medicine and the development of intercultural health models and/or systems.";"Intercultural healt; sociocultural adaptations; cultural relevance; ethnic groups"

Many of them experience symptoms such as abdominal pain, backache, nausea which are commonly perceived as normal. Ayurveda considers menstruation a painless, natural event and recommends specific foods to reduce associated discomfort. This study aimed to evaluate Ayurvedic dietary formulations—Green Gram Soup and Barley Porridge for their effectiveness in alleviating menstrual symptoms.;To align with modern lifestyles, both products were developed in a ready-to-cook format and assessed for nutritional value, safety, and stability. A single-arm, prospective study was conducted on 208 young women aged 14–20 years experiencing menstrual discomfort. Participants consumed the formulations for lunch and dinner during the first three days of their menstrual cycle, across six consecutive cycles. Symptom scores were recorded at baseline, during intermediate follow-ups (1st to 5th), and post-intervention (6th follow-up), and analyzed using the Friedman Test and Mann–Whitney U Test.;"Nutritional analysis confirmed the presence of essential macro- and micronutrients, supporting the products’ role in menstrual health. Heavy metal and pesticide analyses showed levels within FSSAI limits or undetectable. Accelerated stability testing at 40?±?2°C and 75%?±?5% RH for six months demonstrated product stability. The intervention led to statistically significant improvement (p < 0.05) in menstrual symptoms - lower abdominal pain, lower backache, breast tenderness, calf muscle pain, headache, nausea, pimples, loose motion, constipation, loss of appetite, and hot flushes.
Mudga Yusha (MY) ingredients dominated by spicy and sweet taste, hot potency and pungent bio-transformed taste, Laghuguna (lightness), Deepana (appetizer), Pachan (digestion of ama associated with doshas), Rochan (taste enhancer), Shoolhar (antispasmodic), Shothhar (anti-inflammatory) and Tridoshshamak (Tridosha pacifying) properties. It can help by improving Jatharagi (metabolic factors), pacifying Vata thus relieve Purisha avashtambha (obstruction of feaces). 
Yava Payas ingredients possessing sweet, astringent taste, Guruguna (heaviness), cold potency and sweet bio-transformed taste, it will be helpful in Koshtha Shodhan (purification of uterus and bowel) but at the same time it will act as Bruhana (nourishment) relieving vitiated Vata.
The synergetic effects of both products will be helpful in menstruating women by imparting Kosthshodhana (purification of uterus and bowel), Vatashama (Vata pacification) and Agnivardhana (enhancing digestive/ metabolic factors). Hence these products could have been found effective in alleviating associated symptoms of menstruation. In extension to this, primary ingredients of both articles i. e. green gram and barley have already proven effective in primary dysmenorrhoea. Additionally all the herbs have proven for anti-inflammatory actions.
According to National Institute of Nutrition, India guidelines, essential micronutrients like Ca, Mg, Zn, Fe, vitamins B6, A, and C are vital for women’s health. Studies by Bianco et al. and Alikamali et al. link deficiencies in fiber, magnesium, B6, and vitamin E to premenstrual symptoms and dysmenorrhea. The presence of these nutrients in MY and YP products likely contributes to their positive effects, potentially through anti-inflammatory, antioxidant actions and nutritional support in managing menstrual symptoms and supporting overall women’s health.";This study adds a new dimension to the relationship between therapeutic food and menstruation discomfort;"SDG 3- 5- 2- 9; PMS; PCOS; Menstrual health; Endometriosis"

It may lead to comorbidities such as depression, insomnia, cognitive dysfunction, and physiological alterations associated with chronic stress. In this context, the aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of flower essence therapy as a non-pharmacological complementary approach, with anxiety reduction as the primary outcome, and improvements in sleep quality, quality of life, and physiological parameters as secondary outcomes. The guiding research question was: Are flower essences effective in reducing anxiety in medical students, and do they produce positive effects on sleep, quality of life, and physiological indicators?;"This randomized, controlled, triple-blind clinical trial was conducted at the University of Southern Santa Catarina (UNISUL) and included first- to third-year medical students, of both sexes, aged 18 to 30 years. Participants were randomly assigned to two groups (flower essence and placebo, n=15 each) using sealed opaque envelopes with pre-distributed numerical codes. The interventions consisted of 30 ml bottles, visually identical and neutrally labeled by the manufacturer Gotas do Infinictho®, identified only by the colors “blue” and “green,” with the contents known exclusively by the manufacturer. Randomization was performed with allocation concealment, and the study followed a triple-blind model (participants, researchers, and statistical team).
The intervention consisted of daily oral intake of four drops diluted in water for 90 days. Assessments were conducted at baseline, 45 days, and 90 days using validated instruments: the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) for anxiety, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI-BR) for sleep quality, and the Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) for quality of life. Physiological data were collected using HEG® (neurovascular activity), PPG Stress Flow® (heart rate variability), and BIA-ACC® (body composition). Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism software, applying appropriate tests for between-group and repeated-measures comparisons.
The study was approved by the UNISUL Research Ethics Committee (protocol no. 6.594.749), in accordance with Resolution no. 466/12 of the National Health Council. All participants signed an informed consent form. ";"Results indicated a significant reduction in trait anxiety (STAI-T) at 45 and 90 days in the flower essence group, with no significant changes in state anxiety (STAI-S). Progressive improvements in sleep quality (PSQI) and increased scores in the mental health and vitality domains (SF-36) were also observed, suggesting sustained emotional benefits from the intervention.
Although the methodological design sought to minimize bias through allocation concealment and the triple-blind model, potential biases related to sample size, the home-based nature of the intervention, and the shared academic context are acknowledged. These factors will be considered in the final analysis.";The findings suggest that flower essence therapy may be integrated as an innovative and safe approach to mental health care in medical education. Further studies are needed to confirm its efficacy and support broader application.;"Anxiety; Medical Students; Floral Therapy; Clinical Trial; Integrative Practices"

However, despite the global expansion of the integrative health approach — consistently so in Brazil — CIP practices are often applied in spaces designed for conventional medical practice, with or without adaptations, which may be inadequate. Studies on CIP environments are scarce, showing gaps in design guidelines and recommendations in this field. Aiming to contribute to the quality of these environments, this work presents a sequence of three studies on therapeutic settings for CIP. ;The first, conducted using three case studies, identified environmental stimuli that promote user well-being — including those conducive to states of relaxation, contemplation, and meditation. Encouraged by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a psychosocial intervention for stress management, included in the Traditional, Complementary and Integrative Medicine framework (WHO), and widely studied for their health benefits, meditative, contemplative, and relaxation states remain under-researched in built environments. Therefore, as part of an ongoing doctoral project, a second study was conducted as a Systematic Literature Review (SLR),  investigating environmental attributes that influence these states, focusing firstly on built environments in general and secondly on healthcare settings. Thirty-two studies were included in the review, eleven of which focused on healthcare environments. As a result, some categories of environmental attributes influencing the states under study were identified, which were similar to those found in the first research. To support the findings of the SLR, a third study collected data through questionnaires and interviews conducted with fifteen integrative health therapists. Nearly twenty hours of interviews were analyzed using content analysis, resulting in a categorization that aligned with the SLR findings.;The three studies suggest that environmental attributes can support meditative, contemplative, and relaxation states in integrative health therapeutic settings. These attributes may be particularly relevant to practices that aim to induce such states as a therapeutic goal or as support for the primary technique. The studies also identified closely related categories of attributes. Summarizing the results, the first category comprises Tangible and/or Observable Attributes, which includes the following subcategories: Aromas, Art, Cleanliness, Colors and Materials, Furniture, Lighting, Nature, Organization, Outdoor View, Privacy, Sounds, Temperature, and Spatial Configurations. The second category includes Intangible and/or Non-Observable Attributes, encompassing the subcategories: Atmosphere, Spiritual, and Welcomeness.;Some attributes were found to be more influential before the practices, while others were during. Therefore, transitional spaces leading to the treatment areas may also predispose patients to the desired states. Furthermore, the influence of the environment tends to be greater for individuals with less experience accessing meditative, contemplative, and relaxation states. Despite limitations such as small sample sizes, limited representation of CIP specialties, and the heterogeneity of the SLR sample, the findings open up a range of possibilities for environmental attributes, which are being further explored in the ongoing doctoral research. The Ethics Committee CEPSH/UFSC approved the first and third studies. The SLR was registered on the OSF platform.;"healthcare architecture; therapeutic environment; meditative states; relaxation"

Early diagnosis is difficult absent radiographic evidence. HLA-B27 assessment and MRI assist in identifying axSpA prior to radiographic abnormalities but are not cost-effective for screening. Delayed diagnosis can adversely impact treatment which may include exercise, postural training, physical therapy and pharmaceutical management such as NSAIDs or tumor necrosis factor inhibitors in patients who do not respond to first line care. Targeted diet and lifestyle modifications may also be delayed. Inflammatory Back Pain (IBP) screening has been used in primary care orthopedic clinics in Europe to identify those with chronic low back pain (CLBP) who should receive HLA-B27 and MRI assessment for axSpA. The proportion of IBP screened patients with an abnormal MRI is established in these primary care orthopedic clinics but there is no comparable data for patients seeking chiropractic care. The aim of this study is to identify the proportion of patients with an abnormal pelvis MRI among those with CLBP presenting for chiropractic care with possible IBP in the US.;100 adult patients under age 45 with CLBP underwent IBP screening. 75 patients answering ?3 of 5 questions affirmatively were referred for pelvic MRI and HLA-B27 testing. MRI images were interpreted by two experienced readers and categorized by the Assessment of SpondyloArthritis International Society (ASAS) definitions of axSpA. ;Sacroiliac joint MRI abnormalities meeting the 2009 ASAS definition of a positive MRI were observed in 10 patients (13.3%). Hip joints were sufficiently demonstrated in 69 subjects that had a pelvic MRI. Bone narrow edema and hip effusions were observed in nine patients (13.0%). HLA-B27 positivity for subjects with suspected IBP and abnormal pelvis MRIs was 10%.;This is the first study to identify the proportion abnormal pelvic MRI in patients with CLBP suggestive of IBP presenting for chiropractic care in the US. Although the study design did not include a diagnosis of axSpA, it suggests clinical protocol to select patients with suspected IBP who may benefit from HLA-B27 and MRI assessment for axSpA. Those who screen positive for suspected axSpA may benefit from further evaluation and, if appropriate, earlier integrative intervention. The patients seen in the chiropractic clinic did not have a previous diagnosis of axSpA, were not treated with accepted biologic therapies for their symptoms, were not referred to or previously screened by a specialist to determine who should receive an MRI. As a result, we believe that selection biases were reduced which resulted in a prevalence that likely reflects the prevalence of abnormal MRIs in other primary care populations.  ;"Axial spondyloarthorpathy; Pelvis MRI; Chiropractic"

With teething, the inflammatory microenvironment is usually associated with pain. This study investigated the effects of this homeopathic medicinal product and its single active ingredients Chamomilla 9C, Rheum 5C, and Phytolacca decandra 5C on inflammation markers. In this aim, we measured the oxidative stress in inflamed microglial cells and InterCellular Adhesion Molecule-1 (ICAM-1) in inflamed endothelial cells. Microglial cells, resident macrophages present in the central nervous system, are well known to be hypersensitive to reactive oxygen species (ROS) and participate in the immune response. Both ROS and ICAM-1 markers are involved in the inflammatory process in specific microenvironments.;To assess inflammation, oxidative stress and ICAM-1 were measured in microglial cells and in endothelial cells, respectively. The cells were either inflamed with 10 ng/mL LPS (endotoxin) or 1ng/mL TNFalpha. The homeopathic preparations 6% (v/v), positive control (dexamethasone) or vehicle were tested under these inflammatory conditions. The production of mitochondrial and total intracellular ROS was analyzed with MitoSOX (6h) or CellROX (24h) probes using fluorescence microscopy, respectively. ICAM-1 protein was quantified using ELISA assay. The experiments were independently performed three times.;In inflamed microglial cells, the homeopathic medicinal product, Rheum 5C, Phytolacca decandra 5C and Chamomilla 9C significantly decreased by 26 to 35% the ROS production in mitochondria compared with the vehicle. Furthermore, the homeopathic medicinal product, Rheum 5C and Chamomilla 9C significantly decreased the total intracellular ROS production by 20 to 29% compared with the vehicle. with as well as with compared with the vehicle. In contrast, no significant effects with either the homeopathic medicinal product, Rheum 5C, Chamomilla 9C or Phytolacca decandra 5C were obtained in the TNFalpha-inflamed endothelial cell model.;These results showed that the homeopathic medicinal product and all its active ingredients, Rheum 5C, Chamomilla 9C, and Phytolacca decandra 5C, exhibit antioxidative properties in inflamed microglial cells by reducing the production of ROS. Notably, the homeopathic medicinal product and all homeopathic preparations act specifically on ROS mitochondrial production at 6h. Except for Phytolacca decandra 5C, all other active ingredients of the homeopathic medicinal product retained antioxidative properties after 24h. Since significant findings obtained with inflamed microglial cells, further experiments are in progress to investigate a panel of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukins and chemokines. ;"Rheum; Chamomilla; Phytolacca decandra; Oxidative Stress; Inflammation"

Within the paradigm of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), natural antioxidants are increasingly utilized as adjuvants to conventional therapies. Lycopene, a powerful lipophilic antioxidant, has demonstrated anti-inflammatory properties. However, the role of dietary antioxidants in integrative approaches to psoriasis management remains underexplored. Our objective was to evaluate the potential of lycopene as a nutritional CAM intervention by investigating its nonlinear relationship with psoriasis prevalence.;"The data were collected through the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2003–2006; 2009–2014). Dietary lycopene levels were analyzed as a representative non-pharmaceutical CAM modality, with multivariate logistic regression and restricted cubic spline analysis examining its association with psoriasis. Subgroup analysis assessed the consistency of this relationship across populations with varying CAM utilization patterns.";"There were 17,694 participants, with 2.9% (508/17,694) who experienced psoriasis. Compared with individuals with lower lycopene consumption Q1 (<0.77mg/day), the adjusted odds ratio (OR) values for dietary lycopene intake and psoriasis in Q3 (2.72-6.98mg/day) varied across different models: 0.73 (95% CI: 0.57–0.94, p =0.015), 0.77 (95% CI:0.59–0.99, p =0.040), 0.76 (95% CI: 0.59-0.98, p =0.033), and 0.77 (95% CI: 0.59–0.99, p=0.046). The association between dietary lycopene intake and psoriasis exhibited a U-shaped curve (nonlinear, p<0.05), with an inflection point of roughly 4.47 mg/day. The U-shaped association (inflection at 4.47 mg/day) reflects the dualistic nature of nutritional interventions in traditional medicine systems - while moderate intake aligns with the CAM principle of ""food as medicine"", excessive consumption may disrupt redox balance. This parallels dose-dependent effects observed in herbal medicine, underscoring the importance of standardization in CAM protocols.";This study reveals a U-shaped relationship between dietary lycopene consumption and the prevalence of psoriasis among adults in the United States. However, more prospective population studies are needed to verify these findings and explore the underlying mechanisms.;"psoriasis; lycopene; U-shaped; cross-sectional study"

The objective of this study is to investigate whether daily consumption of fermented red cabbage (sauerkraut) alleviates allergic symptoms and modulates inflammation and gut microbiota composition and function in young adults.";In this 8-week, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, 158 participants aged 18–35 with diagnosed allergic condition will be assigned to consume either fermented red cabbage (ramping up to 75g/day) or a sensory-matched, non-fermented red cabbage product. Symptom severity (Total Nose and Eye Symptom Score, TNESS) is the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes include daily symptom ratings, medication use (via mobile Ecological Momentary Assessments, mEMA), quality of life (WHOQOL-BREF), gastrointestinal complaints (GSRS), psychological wellbeing (ADS, GAD-7), and biomarker analyses (CRP, IgE, immune cell counts). Stool and product samples will undergo metagenomic sequencing to evaluate microbiota composition and function. Additionally, participants' experiences and perceived effects will be assessed qualitatively through questionnaires and interviews.;Recruitment and data collection are ongoing. Final results will evaluate feasibility and potential clinical and microbial benefits of incorporating fermented red cabbage into the diet of individuals with allergies.;This study aims to generate first clinical evidence on the therapeutic relevance of fermented red cabbage for allergy management and to advance understanding of diet–microbiome–immune system interactions.;"Fermentedfoods; Allergies; RCT; Immune; Microbiome"

However, in some universities and schools of higher education, subjects related to traditional medicine (TM), alternative, complementary and integrative medicine (CAM) have been included as compulsory subjects. ;For this work -requested by the Andean Health Organization-Hipólito Unanue Agreement (ORAS-CONHU)- the curricula of 725 schools in the Andean region, including universities offering 288 medical, 358 nursing and 79 midwifery degrees in Bolivia (108), Chile (149), Colombia (135), Ecuador (77), Peru (161) and the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (95), were reviewed via the Internet.;A total of 213 university sites and sub-sites were found to offer the mandatory subjects of MT and MAC (almost 30%). In general, 61 courses were detected in medicine (29%), 134 in nursing (63%) and 18 in obstetrics (8%). With a greater presence in Peru, Venezuela, Ecuador, Bolivia, Chile and almost nonexistent in Colombia. In most cases, the specific contents of the subjects are unknown. ;It is concluded -comparing with a similar study in 2011 with 40 courses- that the progress is enormous and significant. It shows that there is a growing interest in the Andean Region to incorporate the topics of traditional medicine and complementary alternatives in the professional training of doctors, nurses and obstetricians of conventional schools, especially in the care provided in the nursing career. ;"Keywords: Traditional medicine; complementary-alternative medicines; university teaching; Andean Region"

This period is also characterized by symptoms such as hot flashes, night sweats, mood disturbances, sleep difficulties, and genitourinary complaints, which can reduce quality of life and exacerbate metabolic risk. Together, these challenges highlight the need for integrative, non-pharmacological strategies. This study evaluated the long-term effects of a structured yoga program on menopausal symptoms in climacteric women with MetS over 6, 12, and 24 months.;A total of 102 sedentary women aged 45–60 years with diagnosed MetS were allocated to either a Shivam Yoga intervention group or a control group. Shivam Yoga is a form of yoga based on Traditional Indian Yoga and grounded in the Samkhya and Tantra philosophies. The intervention group participated in guided 60-minute sessions twice weekly, comprising mental concentration (Dharna, 5 min), energy transmission rituals (Pujas, 4 min), breathing exercises (Pranayamas, 15 min), physical postures (Asanas, 20 min), deep relaxation (Yognidra, 8 min), and meditation (Dhyana, 8 min). Climacteric symptoms were assessed at baseline and at 6, 12, and 24 months using the Kupperman Index (KI), with scores ?19 classified as mild, 20–34 as moderate, and >34 as severe. Changes in total and individual symptom scores were evaluated through within- and between-group comparisons. The study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the Federal University of Ouro Preto (CAAE: 95824318.2.0000.5150).;"Due to loss to follow-up, 36 and 40 participants remained in the Yoga and Control groups at 6 months, 24 and 33 at 12 months, and 15 and 22 at 24 months, respectively. All baseline parameters were similar between groups. At all time points, the Yoga group showed significantly lower median KI scores than the Control group (p < 0.05), indicating reduced symptom severity and frequency. The proportion of participants with moderate or severe symptoms was also significantly lower in the Yoga group at 6 months (p < 0.001) and 12 months (p = 0.036). Among individual symptoms, nervousness showed the most pronounced improvement: scores were significantly lower than those in the Control group at 6 (?32.3%; p = 0.006), 12 (?39.8%; p = 0.003), and 24 months (?39.1%; p = 0.020), with sustained reductions from baseline. At 6 months, further improvements in insomnia (?23.6%; p = 0.034), depressive symptoms (?29.0%; p = 0.070), and palpitations (?23.2%; p = 0.019) were noted. Benefits persisted or intensified at later time points, with the Yoga group reporting significantly fewer palpitations (?32.2%; p = 0.043) and arthralgia/myalgia (?46.0%; p = 0.007) at 24 months.";"Regular practice of Shivam Yoga over 24 months was associated with sustained improvements in climacteric symptoms, particularly nervousness, palpitations, and musculoskeletal discomfort, in women with MetS. These findings support yoga as a promising complementary approach for long-term symptom management during the menopausal transition and post-menopause.

This study presents a comprehensive overview of international research trends and clinical evidence supporting the application of medicinal cannabis across diverse medical conditions;Literature searches were conducted in three English-language electronic databases (Pubmed, Embase, and Cochrane Library) to identify all bibliometric analyses, systematic reviews, or meta-analyses related to medicinal cannabis for any indication. Reviews were classified as systematic if they included a clearly defined and reproducible methodology, including a search strategy and explicit inclusion and exclusion criteria. Studies involving participants with any type and severity of medical condition were included. The primary outcomes extracted from each systematic review or meta-analysis were evidence of effectiveness and safety.;A total of sixty-one eligible studies were included in the analysis. Bibliometric analyses (5 studies) reveal a significant increase in scientific publications since 2019, with the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada leading the field. Evidence mapping (2 studies) from systematic reviews indicates potential efficacy in managing multiple sclerosis, chronic non-cancer pain, HIV-related neuropathic pain, chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, epilepsy, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Clinical practice guidelines (4 studies) and systematic reviews (6 studies) suggest that medicinal cannabis may be beneficial for intractable chemotherapy-related symptoms such as nausea and insomnia in cancer patients. However, evidence remains limited or inconclusive for its broader use in oncology, including appetite stimulation, pain relief, and quality of life enhancement. Economic evaluation (1 study) has identified cost-effectiveness in the treatment of refractory symptoms associated with chronic conditions such as multiple sclerosis and Dravet syndrome. Further evidence supports the use of medicinal cannabis in select neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders (21 studies), including PTSD, Parkinson’s disease, epilepsy, and sleep disorders, though findings are mixed for conditions such as schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorders, and cognitive impairments. In pain management (16 studies), cannabis has demonstrated efficacy in chronic non-cancer pain, with additional studies suggesting reduced opioid use and improved sleep and appetite. Research in other conditions (8 studies)—such as inflammatory bowel disease, geriatric care, palliative care, menopause, and retinal diseases—remains insufficient to draw definitive conclusions.;This review underscores the growing scientific interest in medicinal cannabis while highlighting the urgent need for high-quality, longitudinal, and comparative studies to establish its long-term safety, standardized dosing, and evidence-based clinical guidelines.;"Medicinal cannabis; chronic conditions; evidence; bibliometric analysis; overview"

Our group has shown that a water extract of Centella asiatica (CAW) can attenuate age-related deficits in learning, cognitive flexibility, and recognition memory in mouse models of aging and neurodegenerative disease. We have also demonstrated that CAW improves mitochondrial function and activates antioxidant response in the brains of treated mice and the effects on antioxidant pathways appear to be central to the mitochondrial and cognitive effects of the extract. Here we build on that work to evaluate the vascular effects of CAW in aged mice and elucidate the contributions of selected constituent compounds, triterpenes (TT) and caffeoylquinic acids (CQA), to the cognitive effects of the CAW extract. ;"Three and eighteen-month-old male and female C57BL6 mice were treated with CAW (10g/L) for in their drinking water for 5 weeks and then cerebral perfusion, cerebrovascular reactivity was quantified by MRI.  Plasma was collected and 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) was quantified as a marker of oxidative stress.
In a separate cohort, 18 month old male and female C57BL6 mice were treated with TT, CQA, or TT+CQA in their drinking water at a concentration proportional to their relative abundance in CAW (10 mg/mL) for 5 weeks. In the final two weeks of treatment, mice underwent behavioral assays to assess learning and cognitive flexibility.  
";"CAW treatment increased cerebrovascular reactivity in aged mice.  These effects were accompanied by a reduction in circulating 8OH-dG.  Both TT’s and CQAs separately improved learning and cognitive flexibility in aged mice but interestingly the combination of TT+CQA did not improve cognitive performance.  The improvements elicited by  the compound groups did not reach the same magnitude as what was previously observed in response to the entire CAW extract.
This work demonstrates that improvements in vascular function as well as a reduction in oxidative stress are seen in aged mice in response to CAW.  These effects may contribute to the improved cognitive performance we have previously reported.  The compound testing suggests that both TTs and CQAs contribute to the cognitive improvements evoked by CAW in aged mice but that their effects may be modulated by other constituents within the extract.  ";"Determination of active compounds and identification of translationally relevant biomarkers, like vascular imaging and circulating markers of oxidative stress, will help inform standardization of CAW for future clinical testing.  In fact, a safety and tolerability clinical trial is currently underway assessing many of these same endpoints as secondary outcomes.

However, population prevalence data is largely absent in Australasia. We aimed to address this gap by conducting a nationally representative survey.;We surveyed adults in Australia (n = 2,072) and New Zealand (n = 571) in 2023, using census-informed quotas for age, gender, ancestry/ethnicity, region and income. We calculated lifetime and past-year meditation use estimates and conducted univariable analyses and multivariable logistic regression to investigate predictive factors.;"We estimate that 41.5% of Australian (about 8.6 million) and 35.7% of New Zealand (about 1.5 million) adults have ever used meditation, while 32.8% (about 6.8 million) and 24.9% (about 1 million), respectively, used meditation in the past year. In multivariable regression, only education (Australia: Odds Ratio (OR) = 1.37; New Zealand: OR = 1.57) and age (Australia: OR = 0.78; New Zealand: OR = 0.59) predicted past-year use in Australia and New Zealand.
Multivariable regression indicated several sociodemographic characteristics (Australia: gender, ancestry/ethnicity; New Zealand: LGBTQIA+ status) and health factors (Australia: cannabis use, psychedelic use, mental healthcare utilisation, complementary/alternative healthcare utilisation; New Zealand: physical healthcare utilisation) that were related to past-year meditation use. Over 21.7% of Australian (about 1.5 million) and 17.6% of New Zealand (about 0.2 million) meditators experienced a meditation-related adverse effect.
";Australia and New Zealand have amongst the highest rates of meditation use globally, with signs that meditation being used as an adjunct and/or alternative to mental health services. There is a need for more research into specific meditation practices and their application to mental health.

However, engaging with communities to understand their needs and sociocultural contexts, and building on any contemplative practices already existing locally, is essential to ensuring contemplative practice interventions will gain traction and yield enduring benefit. Despite this, few studies have engaged with communities to discover what they might need from contemplative practices and what forms of contemplative practices might be most acceptable and valuable in different socio-economic, demographic, cultural, and geographic contexts. We conducted a proof-of-concept study for co-designing contemplative practices with communities. We aimed to (1) demonstrate the potential of the approach and (2) obtain feedback from community members and practitioners involved to refine our methodology.;Employing a participatory action research methodology, we collaborated with semi-rural communities in the Huon Valley, Tasmania, which were affected by environmental and social challenges. We consulted with the community to understand their local mental health needs and how contemplative practices could support them. We then co-developed a short contemplative practice intervention. To inform future iterations, we evaluated the co-design process through a collective reflective exercise, incorporating regular individual and group reflections. Additionally, we assessed the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effectiveness of the intervention through surveys and focus groups.;"Community consultations engaged diverse community members. Concerns converged on the limited resources available to those with caring roles in the community, whether professional or personal (e.g., caring for a loved one). Local contemplative practitioners co-designed the intervention, a workshop for carers that combined nature connection with mindfulness-based practices. Our reflections concluded that the community consultation and co-design process was successful in shaping the intervention in ways unanticipated by researchers. Challenges included gaining trust from the most vulnerable sectors of the local community, who were frustrated with previous consultations; bridging differences between various sub-communities; tolerating uncertainties during the process; addressing local language sensitivities; collaborating with local healthcare and wellness institutions and providers while maintaining independence of the process; and communicating clearly about what we could and could not do for the community.";This project provides initial insights to develop a framework to guide the co-creation of contemplative practice interventions with diverse communities. Working at local community levels could lead to more effective, sustainable, and culturally relevant complementary mind-body health interventions based on contemplative practices.;"contemplative practices; participatory action research; co-design; Resilience; mental health"

With population aging, a growing number of women are experiencing menopause, underscoring the importance of strategies to manage the associated metabolic changes. Evidence suggests that yoga practice may help modulate metabolic parameters. In this context, the present study aimed to evaluate the effects of 24 weeks of Shivam Yoga practice on glycemic regulation in climacteric women.;Forty-one women aged 40–65 years with impaired fasting glucose (>100 mg/dL) were enrolled and allocated to either a yoga group (n = 18) or a control group (n = 23). The yoga group participated in twice-weekly 60-minute Shivam Yoga sessions for 24 weeks. Each session included the following components: mental concentration (Dharana, 5 minutes), energy transmission rituals (Pujas, 4 minutes), breathing exercises (Pranayamas, 15 minutes), psychophysical postures (Asanas, 20 minutes), deep relaxation (Yognidra, 8 minutes), and meditation (Dhyana, 8 minutes). The control group was instructed to maintain their usual daily activities throughout the study period. All participants were interviewed, and blood samples were collected before and after the intervention for fasting glucose and insulin measurements. From these values, the HOMA-IR and QUICKI indices were calculated to assess insulin resistance and sensitivity, respectively. Although diet was not controlled, other lifestyle factors were monitored. Medication use was tracked, and participants who initiated any new regular physical activity during the study were excluded from the analyses.;The yoga group showed significant reductions in fasting glucose (107.5 mg/dL to 102.5 mg/dL, p=0.001), insulin (8.02 mIU/mL to 6.96 mIU/mL, p=0.009), and HOMA-IR (2.26 to 1.74, p=0.002), along with a significant increase in the QUICKI index (0.34 to 0.36, p=0.004), indicating improved insulin sensitivity. No significant changes were observed in the control group. Between-group comparisons at the end of the study showed significantly better outcomes for the yoga group in fasting glucose, HOMA-IR, and QUICKI. These findings are consistent with previous studies reporting improved insulin sensitivity following yoga practice across various populations. The beneficial effects observed may be linked to stress reduction, inflammatory modulation, and improved autonomic nervous system function.;"Regular yoga practice appears to support glycemic control and improve insulin resistance in climacteric women, suggesting its value as a complementary strategy for managing metabolic disorders during this life stage.

Although the incidence of TMD is low (3.9%), its global prevalence is estimated at 34%, reaching 47% in South America. This characterises it as a public health problem and highlights the need for accessible and effective therapeutic approaches. This scoping review aimed to map and synthesize the scientific evidence on the effectiveness and implementation features of group-based interventions for the relief of the signs and symptoms of TMD.;Indexed descriptor-based search strategies were used in the following databases: PubMed, LILACS, EMBASE, Scopus, SciELO, Web of Science, Cochrane Library and Google Scholar, up to July 2024, with no language restrictions. Articles were selected using the Joanna Briggs Institute criteria. To conduct a detailed analysis of implementation, we used the RE-AIM framework, which focuses on aspects such as reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and maintenance. This review is registered on the OSF site under the identifier: DOI: 10.17605/OSF.IO/SB3DM.;Eight articles were included in the final analysis, comprising data from 389 individuals. Six were uncontrolled clinical trials, one was a pilot study and one was a randomised clinical trial. The interventions in the trials mainly reached women, as they are 56% more likely to be affected by TMD than men. In terms of effectiveness, group-based therapeutic strategies such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), mindfulness, yoga and health education have showed promising benefits, including reduced pain, catatrofising, stress, anxiety, depression, and improved mandibular range of motion. In addition, economic and social benefits were highlighted, such as cost reduction, improved time efficiency in care, and increased social support among patients. Reports of negative effects are absent. None of the trials reported adoption criteria regarding the institutions promoting the interventions. Only one study reported implementation criteria in terms of physical space, training and skills of the professionals involved in the delivery of the interventions. No data were reported on the maintenance of the interventions by the institutions where the trials were conducted. Only two trials followed up participants. They showed sustained benefits in terms of pain remission for a health education intervention at 4 months and for a CBT intervention at 12 months. However, the heterogeneity of the diagnostic criteria, the lack of control groups and the lack of follow-up in most of the included studies reduces the generalisability of the results.;We concluded that integrative practice group interventions for the management of TMD signs and symptoms may positively impact public health due to the aforementioned benefits and low cost. However, further studies with more rigorous methodologies are needed to confirm the effectiveness of these interventions and detail basic implementation criteria. The RE-AIM framework has enhanced the evaluation of interventions. In addition to effectiveness, it enables the evaluation of critical intervention features important for adapting them to different contexts.  We strongly recommend using implementation science frameworks to design future studies.;"Temporomandibular Disorder; Mindfulness; yoga; Health Education; Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy"

The duration of TCM-guided interventions ranged from 3 days to 144 weeks (Median: 12w). seven outcomes were reported with various measuring time range (Quality-of-life, measuring time point range 2week (w) -100w; Clinical symptoms of western medicine, 2w – 52w; Clinical symptoms of TCM,4w – 48w;  Laboratory Index,2w – 72w; Clinical effective rate,1w – 72w; Adverse event, 2w – 100w; and Cognitive function,1w – 100w). Cognitive function outcomes involved 86 assessment scales, with the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) being the most utilized (660studies, 70.36%).    A total of 553 studies reported Clinical effective rate, and 124 studies reported composite clinical effective rate (22.42%) . Most studies (720 studies) reported that TCM-guided interventions improved cognitive function in AD-related patients. RCTs lacked rigor in blinding outcome assessors (773 studies with high risk of bias, 82.41%).";Clinical research on TCM for AD-related disorders is with large quantity and variety in TCM therapy schemes, but inconsistencies in diagnosis as well as methodological deficiency remain.

The World Health Organization (WHO) defines health literacy as the capacity to obtain, understand, and apply health-related information to promote and maintain quality of life. The growing acknowledgment of integrative and complementary health practices, as supported by the Brazilian National Policy on Integrative and Complementary Practices (PNPIC – Ordinance 971/2006 and subsequent updates), has amplified the discussion on the importance of health literacy as a strategy to promote health and support autonomy in therapeutic choices. In this context, the homeopathic medical rationale stands out for adopting a patient-centered clinical model that emphasizes active listening and integrality. This approach encourages meaningful dialogue between practitioner and patient, deepens the understanding of the health-illness process, and fosters shared responsibility in care. This study aims to analyze, from the perspective of health literacy, the potential of homeopathy to contribute to health education and autonomy promotion, particularly in primary care settings.;"This is a qualitative, exploratory study based on a narrative literature review. Searches were conducted in the PubMed, SciELO, and HomeopatiaBVS databases using the descriptors “homeopathy,” “health literacy,” and “integrative practices.” The search included articles published between 2014 and 2024, in Portuguese, English and Spanish. Official documents from WHO and the Brazil’s Unified Health System (SUS) were also included. Inclusion criteria comprised peer-reviewed articles addressing the relationship between homeopathy and health literacy, helath education, or patient empowerment. Studies focusing solely on clinical efficacy were excluded. A total of 94 records were identified; after screening and full-text review, 17 articles were included in the final analysis. Data were extracted using structured reading sheets and a thematic content analysis was conducted to identify central categories.";"Two main aspects of homeopathy’s contribution to health literacy were identified: (1) the promotion of dialogue and qualified listening—homeopathic consultations foster the expression of personal narratives and support a broader understanding of illness; and (2) the stimulation of empowerment and shared responsibility—homeopathy’s individualized prescriptions and explanation of therapeutic rationale promote active engagement in care. Studies also show that individuals with higher health literacy levels tend to use integrative therapies more safely and consciously. Homeopathy’s integrative model promotes reflective and critical dialogue by linking physical, emotional, and social dimensions of care. This strengthens patient understanding of their health process and contributes to autonomy building. Nevertheless, persistent challenges include misinformation about integrative practices, limited professional training, and institutional barriers to implementation. Strengthening health literacy as a structural axis of public health policy can help legitimize practices such as homeopathy and ensure their safe, ethical, and effective use.";Homeopathy demonstrates strong potential for promoting health literacy by encouraging autonomy, critical thinking, and a broader understanding of health and disease. Its integration into health education actions and primary care services can contribute to more humanized, participatory, and effective healthcare. Investing in professional training and fostering environments that support therapeutic dialogue are essential steps for realizing this potential.;"Homeopathy; health literacy; health promotion; comprehensive health care"

During this period, traditional citation-based metrics have been the assumed norm used to measure the impact of research. However, in the information age, alternative metrics (altmetrics) offer a unique opportunity to evaluate the social impact of research in the digital landscape and enable real-time responses to shifts in public interest by analyzing patterns in the online discourse surrounding TCIM research. This insight is valuable to researchers, stakeholders, and policymakers alike. The objective of this study was to conduct an altmetric analysis of research outputs under the TCIM subject area to reveal patterns in social engagement and identify factors that drive impact online.";This study was conducted using Altmetric.com where a single search was executed using the subject “Traditional, Complementary, and Integrative Medicine”. The data returned from this search was analyzed to reveal patterns concerning journal/collection title, open access status/type, attention scores, output type, subject area, and mentions across all platforms by average, and by country. For articles with an Altmetric attention score of 10 or higher, the most frequently mentioned health concerns and TCIM therapies (based on the keywords present in these publications), and the language of publication were identified through a Scopus search using DOIs. For the top 20 articles with the highest Altmetric attention scores, the date of publication and type of study were also identified.;The greatest number of mentions were contributed by X (n = 350 630, 70.41%), Facebook (n = 57 540, 11.55%), and news outlets (n = 39 941, 8.02%). Research in the form of a news output (M = 203.67) or published under an open access status (M = 11.76) was associated with the highest average Altmetric attention scores. The Journal of Natural Products had the greatest number of mentioned outputs (n = 5314, 10.56%), total mentions (n = 60 782, 12.21%), and mentions on X (n = 47 197, 13.46%). Following the 4208 ‘Traditional, Complementary, and Integrative Medicine’ subject area, most articles were classified under 3214 ‘Pharmacology and Pharmaceutical Sciences’ (n = 8628, 13.85%), and 3202 ‘Clinical Sciences’ (n=3917, 6.29%). Approximately 1% of the articles were written on the topic of COVID-19 (n=707, 1.13%). Among the articles with an attention score of 10 or above, the most frequently mentioned health concerns were low back pain (n=571), pain (n=496), and depression (n=389), and the most frequently mentioned TCIM therapy was acupuncture (n=2666).;This study provides insight into how TCIM research is received beyond academic audiences by identifying factors associated with increased online engagement. By implementing characteristics reported in this study which are consistent with increased online attention, researchers can align dissemination efforts with public interest, thereby increasing visibility and ultimately helping bridge the gap between research and policy. Future research may include investigating the demographic factors behind the uptake of TCIM research online.;"altmetrics; Integrative Medicine; traditional medicine; social impact; social media"

Despite this, researcher and clinician (R&C) perceptions of CAIM have not been studied across medical disciplines on a global scale. Understanding these viewpoints may provide insight into the foundational understanding of CAIM among R&Cs and the necessity of CAIM-based educational resources to support professionals internationally. The purpose of this study is to analyze CAIM perceptions among R&Cs from seven medical disciplines through seven cross-sectional surveys.;Participants were sent an electronic survey through email addresses extracted from articles indexed in MEDLINE and published in journals focused on the discipline being studied (i.e., cardiology, neurology, oncology, pain, pediatrics, psychiatry, or surgery). Basic descriptive statistics and thematic content analyses were used to analyze quantitative and open-ended qualitative responses, respectively.;A combined total of 5184 R&Cs participated across all seven surveys. In all disciplines except psychiatry and pain, most participants had never received formal (range across disciplines: 70.33%–80.70%) or supplemental (52.49%–67.06%) CAIM training and had never conducted CAIM-based research (68.82%–77.01%). Yet, most participants from all disciplines believed there was value in providing formal (52.31%–64.14%) and supplementary education (61.81%–71.01%) to clinicians and conducting CAIM research (77.89%–88.41%). Preferences for CAIM therapies varied by subcategory, with mind-body therapies being viewed as the most promising (47.11%–78.04%) and biofield therapies as the least (4.49%–7.58%) across all surveys. In open-ended responses, the need for expanded research and educational resources for CAIM interventions and concerns regarding CAIM safety/regulation were recurring themes in all disciplines.;Results suggest that there is a need to develop CAIM research and educational resources to support R&Cs. Future studies may use interviews and focus groups to further explore R&C perceptions beyond these surveys and determine how such resources may be effectively implemented internationally.;"complementary and alternative medicine; Integrative Medicine; mind-body therapies; barriers; perceptions and attitudes"

The debate, which is mainly conducted in the public media, is multifaceted and involves concerns about the scientific plausibility, efficacy and ethical considerations. To overcome the current impasse, citizen science may offer a promising means of encouraging dialogue and collaboration. Accordingly, our objective was to develop a very simple plant bioassay that would facilitate replication and multi-centre trials by the general public without the need for sophisticated equipment.;Cress seeds (Lepidium sativum L.) were grown in vitro within Ca(NO3)2 salt tolerance levels, resulting in a moderate reduction of the seedling length compared to cress grown in water. Screening experiments were conducted with seven homeopathic preparations (Aurum muriaticum natronatum, Nitricum acidicum, Carbo vegetabilis, Natrium muriaticum, Nux vomica, Phosphorus and Silicea) in the potency levels 10x, 20x, 30x (applied as commercially available globules) with 160 cress seeds per condition. Outcome was the total seedling length.;The experiments demonstrated unequivocal, highly significant growth-modulating effects compared to control (unimpregnated globules) for multiple preparations in different potency levels.;The results of this very simple plant bioassay establish a basis for future citizen science endeavours, such as replication and multicentre trials, that the general public can undertake in the domain of homeopathic basic research.

The treatment is based on the use of several classes of medications for symptom relief, which may cause adverse effects. Thus, it becomes necessary to use a non-drug treatment such as acupuncture, whose efficacy in relieving TMD symptoms has been observed.The parameters evaluated were mouth opening, visual analog pain scale (VAS), serum cortisol and glucose levels, and dentristy evaluation. The duration of treatment were 12 sessions for each type of acupuncture; with the interval of a week between each session, been the same for all types of acupuncture.

Xiaozhiling (XZL) injection, a traditional Chinese therapy, is increasingly integrated with surgical techniques, yet its comparative efficacy and safety remain understudied. This systematic review synthesizes evidence on XZL-based interventions versus conventional surgeries.;We systematically searched Chinese (CNKI, VIP, Wanfang, CBM) and international databases (PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library) for studies comparing XZL (alone or combined with procedures like procedure for prolapsing hemorrhoids, ruiyun procedure for hemorrhoids, tissue selective therapy) to conventional surgeries. Data extraction, bias assessment (Cochrane ROB tools), and meta-analysis (ReviewManager 5.3) were conducted. Evidence quality was graded using GRADE.;"Among the 200 studies included, the application of XZL injection therapy and its combination with different surgical methods were as follows: 29 studies (14.5%) used XZL monotherapy, primarily for internal hemorrhoids (17 studies), rectal prolapse (7 studies), and outlet obstruction constipation (5 studies). XZL combined with PPH (procedure for prolapse and hemorrhoids) was applied in 11 studies (5.5%), while 25 studies (12.5%) involved XZL in combination with RPH (rubber band ligation). Additionally, 11 studies (5.5%) combined XZL with the TST (transanal stapled technique). The most frequent combination, seen in 80 studies (40%), was XZL with the traditional external hemorrhoidectomy/internal hemorrhoidectomy (Milligan-Morgan hemorrhoidectomy). Lastly, 44 studies (22%) utilized XZL combined with conventional Western surgical methods, primarily for rectal prolapse (12 studies) and outlet obstruction constipation (32 studies). Outcomes of primary concern included length of stay, postoperative pain and edema, postoperative complications, and recurrence.
From 200 studies addressing nine clinical questions, key findings included:
Pain reduction: XZL combined with Milligan-Morgan hemorrhoidectomy significantly reduced postoperative pain (MD =-0.96 [-1.45, -0.48], 5RCTs, very low quality evidence). XZL alone showed no difference (MD = -0.28 [-1.31, 0.74]), 3 RCTs, evidence quality was very low.
Hospital stay: XZL with Milligan-Morgan hemorrhoidectomy shortened hospitalization (MD = -3.01 [-4.00, -2.03], 10RCTs, very low quality evidence), while XZL-TST yielded no significant difference (MD = -2.00 [-4.13, 0.13], 5RCTs, very low quality evidence).
Constipation: XZL combined with traditional hemorrhoidectomy reduced bowel difficulty scoring (SMD = -0.69 [-1.37, -0.02] , 7RCTs, very low quality evidence).
Evidence distribution revealed heterogeneity in study designs and outcomes. Most findings were graded as low/very low quality due to small samples, methodological flaws (e.g., allocation concealment issues), and inconsistent reporting.

In Latin America, particularly Brazil, Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) shows high prevalence, with limited tolerability of conventional treatments such as SSRIs and benzodiazepines due to adverse effects like serotonin syndrome and withdrawal phenomena. Sphaeranthus indicus Linn. (Mundi), is a classical Ayurveda herb prescribed for Manovikara (psychosomatic disorders) and Chittodvega (anxiety states). Thus, a series of studies are conducted to validate its anxiolytic potential. This study adopts a translational triad—clinical, preclinical, and in-silico approaches—to validate the anxiolytic efficacy of S. indicus, bridging Ayurvedic neuroscience with modern psychopharmacology. Therefore, a complete profile for understanding Sphaeranthus indicus as a Natural Anxiolytic is developed and will be presented in the conference.;"The evaluation of Sphaeranthus indicus Linn. (Mundi) is done on clinical, pre-clinical and by In Vitro methods. In clinical study, the randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial on 50 patients with General Anxiety disorder (GAD) having (DSM-IV-TR; HAM-A ?17) was done. The study was conducted for 8 weeks and changes in HAM-A scores, core anxiety symptoms, and secondary parameters (NIMHANS Psychological Tool, Manas Bhava Parikshana) were analysed. 
Preclinical evaluation was done on Swiss albino mice (n=6/group), the aqueous extract (SIAE), hydroalcoholic extract (SIHE), was evaluated with positive control (diazepam, piracetam). Behavioural assays included Elevated Plus Maze, actophotometer, and Morris Water Maze. Cortical and hippocampal histology was examined.
To know the probable pathway of action In-silico analysis of phytochemicals (e.g., pheanthine, neral, eugenol, 4-methoxycinnamaldehyde) were screened using IMPPAT database. ADME study was done using SWISS Target prediction and toxicity study was done using Protox database. Gene targets were screened using Swiss Target Prediction. Pathway enrichment mapped interactions with serotonergic, dopaminergic, and monoaminergic targets
";"The clinical trial showed significant HAM-A score reduction in the intervention group (?HAM-A: 63.2% vs. 18.4% placebo; p < 0.001). Marked improvements were noted in fear (80.0%), anxious mood (63.2%), insomnia (72.9%), and depressive symptoms (62.2%) (p < 0.005). No undesirable events or vital deviations were reported.
In vivo, SIAE increased open-arm exploration (11.94 ± 4.45 s vs. 4.22 ± 0.97 s; p < 0.01) and reduced locomotor activity, suggesting GABAergic action. SIAE and SIHE shortened escape latency in the Morris Water Maze, indicative of cognitive enhancement and NMDA receptor engagement. Histology confirmed neuroprotection without cytotoxicity.
Computational docking identified multiple bioactives targeting serotonin receptors (HTR1A, HTR2A, HTR3A), MAOA, MAOB, COMT, and CCKBR. Key pathways included serotonergic transmission, monoamine modulation, GPCR signalling, and neurodegeneration attenuation. Notably, pheanthine, neural, and 4-methoxycinnamaldehyde were linked to dual serotonergic and monoaminergic activity.
";This integrative study supports S. indicus as a safe, pleiotropic anxiolytic, modulating GABAergic, serotonergic, and neurotrophic mechanisms. Findings justify a comparable anti-anxiety potential of S. indicus   to SSRI in reducing anxiety and enhancing quality of life. By aligning Ayurvedic insights with neurobiological precision, this work pioneers culturally congruent, evidence-based phytotherapeutics for global mental health care.;"Anxiolytic; Generalized Anxiety Disorder; Sphaeranthus indicus"

There are currently no systematic reviews that comprehensively evaluate homeopathy as a patient-centered whole medical system in accordance with contemporary scientific standards.  We therefore decided to develop a framework that highlights the importance of complexity, context and patient perspectives, as is appropriate for many TCIM systems, including homeopathy. This framework will provide the required context for a systematic review program on the effects of homeopathic preparations in a range of clinical indications.;A systems perspective considers the patient as a complex system of interconnected regulative subsystems embedded in a complex environment, and disease as a dysregulation of the dynamic adaptive state of the organism. Most TCIM systems, including homeopathy, aim to stimulate regulative systems and their functions to re-gain homeostasis, rather than to structurally change something within the organism. The consequences of this with regard to the approach to evidence synthesis were explored, and its implementation is illustrated by the planned systematic review program on the effects of homeopathic preparations. ;"A systems perspective requires additional ‘real-world’ evidence, which is why the systematic review program will include non-randomized prospective comparative studies (NRSIs) as well as Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs). A patient advocate will be involved during the entire research program and input from patients with living experience with homeopathy for the clinical indication concerned will be incorporated in each of the systematic reviews. 
The RCT and NRSI evidence on homeopathic products for a range of clinical indications will be synthesized, using a decontextualized approach. Therefore, a limitation is that these findings will still need to be positioned within the broader context of the existing state of knowledge in order to inform decisions, recommendations and treatment guidelines. The latter can be based on the evidence-to-decision framework or similar approaches. 
";The framework developed can be used to inform systematic review programs of TCIM modalities. The systematic review program of homeopathy is expected to make a significant contribution to informing societal discussion about the role of homeopathy in healthcare systems.;"Homeopathy; Systematic Review; Complexity; Systems-perspective"

Considering this impact, along with the contraindications and adverse effects that may be associated with conventional pharmacological treatments, there is growing interest in traditional, complementary, and integrative medicine as suitable approaches for managing climacteric symptoms. Although the number of studies in this field has increased, robust and well-controlled evidence regarding the efficacy and safety of certain practices, such as Reiki therapy and aromatherapy, remains limited, particularly when these interventions are applied in combination. In this context, this pilot study aimed to evaluate the effects of Reiki therapy and inhalation of Citrus sinensis essential oil on climacteric symptoms in women aged 40 to 67 years.;Nine women were recruited through active search and randomly assigned to one of five intervention groups: (1) Reiki, (2) aromatherapy, (3) Reiki/aromatherapy combination, (4) placebo for Reiki, and (5) placebo for aromatherapy. Aromatherapy involved the use of Citrus sinensis essential oil, administered both during face-to-face weekly sessions (via a diffuser for 30 minutes) and at home (by placing five drops of the essential oil on a piece of paper beside the pillow overnight). This protocol was followed by participants in Groups 2 and 3. Group 5, which received placebo aromatherapy, followed the same procedure, with both forms of application, using almond oil instead. Reiki therapy consisted of activating six body points for five minutes each during face-to-face sessions, while the placebo group received sham Reiki. Additionally, participants in Groups 1, 3 and 4 were instructed to lie down for 20 minutes at a prearranged time to receive remote Reiki or sham Reiki, respectively. Group 3 followed both the aromatherapy and Reiki protocols. The interventions lasted eight weeks. Climacteric symptoms were assessed using the Menopausal Rating Scale (MRS) at baseline and after eight weeks.;All treatment groups demonstrated improvements from baseline to the 8-week timepoint across all Menopause Rating Scale (MRS) domains: general, somatic, psychological, and urogenital symptoms. The combined techniques group showed mean score reductions of 9.33, 3.33, 5.34, and 2.33 points, respectively. Reiki alone resulted in the greatest overall improvement, with reductions of 12.00 (general), 4.50 (somatic), 3.50 (psychological), and 0.50 (urogenital) points. Aromatherapy yielded less pronounced reductions: 6.00, 1.00, 3.00, and 1.00 points, respectively. Placebo groups also experienced slight improvements, though in fewer domains and to a lesser degree. The Reiki placebo group showed improvements in general (?2.00) and somatic (?1.00) symptoms, while the aromatherapy placebo group showed a 2.00-point reduction in psychological symptoms only. These modest effects may be attributed to the relaxing nature of the sessions.;"Reiki and aromatherapy show promising potential for alleviating climacteric symptoms and, consequently, improving women's quality of life during this phase. Further studies with larger sample sizes are needed to confirm these findings and establish their statistical significance.

However, the quality of published RCTs of traditional Chinese medicine is uneven, and strict randomization and blinding are often not implemented, which has a high risk of bias. Blinding method is an important part of RCT, which can avoid the influence of human factors on the objectivity and effectiveness of the test results, so as to ensure the internal validity and repeatability of the study. The purpose of this study is to introduce the blind quality evaluation method of clinical trials of traditional Chinese medicine and to explore its application in clinical practice.;All Chinese medicine clinical trials published in Chinese and English were included in this study. These trials were evaluated by blind method and the results were reported. We searched randomized controlled trials ( RCTs ) from the establishment of the database to May 2025 in CNKI, Wanfang, VIP, Sinomed, Pubmed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library. The main results are the James Blindness Index ( James 's BI ) and the Bang Blindness Index ( Bang 's BI ).;A total of 84 eligible randomized controlled trials were included in this study. The average value of James 's BI was 0.54, the average value of Bang 's BI in the experimental group was 0.48, and the average value of Bang 's BI in the control group was-0.21. The results showed that the implementation of the overall blinding method was reasonable, but the subjects in the experimental group were more likely to guess the group allocation than the control group.;Blind evaluation can not only reflect the accuracy of blind results and data, but also increase the credibility of research results. However, the implementation of blind method in the field of traditional Chinese medicine is not perfect. It is suggested to improve the level of placebo production and use JBI and BBI for quantitative blind evaluation in future blind clinical trials of traditional Chinese medicine.;"randomized controlled trials; blind quality evaluation; Traditional Chinese Medicine"

Despite their widespread clinical application, the immediate physiological and clinical sequelae of these interventions remain largely uninvestigated. This study aimed to ascertain the immediate hemodynamic profile of the portal vein subsequent to the application of specific osteopathic visceral techniques within the hepatic region, as assessed via Doppler ultrasonography (US).;"This randomized, blinded pilot clinical trial enrolled 15 healthy volunteers (12 females, 3 males; mean age 34.00 ± 5.40 years) who were systematically allocated into three distinct intervention groups (n=5 per group): Group M1 received sub-hepatic pyloric release; Group M2 underwent liver decongestion; and Group M3 received liver elevation in the supine position. Each participant underwent two Doppler US examinations, conducted by a qualified radiologist: one preceding and one immediately subsequent to the therapeutic intervention. During each assessment, portal vein diameter and blood flow velocity were quantitatively measured using a Medison X8 Doppler US system (Samsung, Korea). Systemic arterial pressure was concurrently measured using a standard sphygmomanometer (HEM-7113, Omron, USA). Furthermore, the cross-sectional area, volumetric flow, and congestion index of the portal vein were computed";Mean pre- and post-intervention measurements were compiled for portal vein flow, velocity, and diameter across all intervention groups. For illustrative purposes, in Group M1, the mean portal vein flow exhibited a reduction from 1100.60 ± 263.77 ml/min pre-intervention to 981.76 ± 327.75 ml/min post-intervention. Similarly, portal vein velocity demonstrated a consistent decrease across all groups (e.g., Group M1: 26.48 ± 6.60 cm/s pre-intervention vs. 20.77 ± 4.92 cm/s post-intervention). Conversely, portal vein diameter exhibited relative stability. The congestion index values for all experimental groups were found to be consistent with established normal physiological reference ranges (approximately 0.70 ± 0.029 cm/s). Moreover, a discernible trend towards reduced mean systemic arterial pressure was noted across all groups post-intervention. Nevertheless, no statistically significant alterations from baseline were detected for any of the quantitatively assessed hemodynamic parameters;This pilot investigation confirms the methodological feasibility of assessing immediate hemodynamic responses to osteopathic visceral techniques with Doppler ultrasonography. Though no statistically significant changes were observed from baseline, consistent trends showed reductions in portal vein flow, velocity, and volume, alongside decreased systemic arterial pressure post-intervention. These observed patterns strongly suggest a genuine physiological and acute systemic effect. The statistical insignificance, likely due to sample size, underscores the crucial need for robust inquiry. Therefore, these preliminary yet promising findings necessitate larger, adequately powered randomized controlled trials. Such studies are vital to confirm effects, elucidate mechanisms, and explore long-term clinical implications for patients with hepatic or systemic hemodynamic dysfunctions. Rigorous research is fundamental for validating therapeutic efficacy and integrating osteopathic visceral manipulation into evidence-based clinical practice, ultimately enhancing patient care and informing clinical guidelines globally.;"osteopathy; Osteopathic Manipulation; Hemodynamics; Portal Vein"

When offered in Primary Health Care, PICS improve the health status of the population. PICS were introduced in the official organizational chart of the Municipality of Rio de Janeiro in 1992, through the creation of the Alternative Medicine Department. Despite this long journey, their implementation in Primary Health Care remains a challenging. This study aimed to analyze the potential and challenges regarding the institutionalization of PICS within the Primary Health Care in the city of Rio de Janeiro from the perspective of managers.;This is a cross-sectional, descriptive research with a qualitative approach is based on secondary sources from the Municipal Health Department of Rio de Janeiro database and interviews with managers directly involved in primary health care. This local research ethics committees approved this study by CAAE number 58155522.2.3001.5279.;The data analysis revealed the presence of at least one integrative and complementary practice in 64% of primary healthcare units, as well as professionals' interest in training in these practices. Semi-structured interviews were conducted that addressed four main dimensions: service structuring, action planning, professional training, and the credibility of PICS. The interviews were transcribed and analyzed using Bardin's method. Weaknesses were identified in the areas of funding, monitoring, training, evidence, and safety.;PICS were found to be a powerful force in healthcare, offering differentiated and complementary approaches to the primary healthcare team's work process.

The Flower Essence Therapy developed by Edward Bach was initially intended for humans, intended to support the treatment of emotional issues. The companionship between humans and their pets brings various benefits, such as emotional support, protection, and participation in therapies. However, the increasing humanization of pets has been associated with undesired behaviors in animals and emotional imbalances in their guardians. This study aimed at evaluating an online experiential model for guardians seeking to improve their relationship with their pets through self-awareness supported by Flower Essence Therapy.;This is a preliminary exploratory study with a qualitative approach, based on online experiences, a digital questionnaire, and recorded interviews. It was carried out with pet owner and their pets in Paraíba and São Paulo, Brazil, between June and July 2024, and was previously approved by the Research Ethics Committees for humans (CAAE: 72894523.9.0000.5188) and animals (CEUA n° 3262100823). Participants were recruited through direct invitations or the snowball sampling method, totaling 14 participants. The interviews were analyzed through thematic categories, which were organized empirically based on the statements of the pet owners, guided by Minayo's qualitative research framework. Two synchronous online experiential sessions were held, with participant reports recorded for later analysis.;Fourteen female guardians over 18 years old participated, along with 14 pets — five cats and nine dogs, aged between 1 and 18 years, nine of which had been rescued from distressing situations. The participants and their animals used two different formulations from the Sistema Florais da Amazônia (Amazonian Flower Essences system). The guardians received the Purificação formula (Purification), taken orally at a dosage of four drops four times a day, starting 15 days before the first session, and the Renascimento formula (Rebirth), with the same dosage, starting the day after the first session. The animals received specific formulations developed by the veterinary researcher, named Animal Identity Formula for Dogs and Animal Identity Formula for Cats. Thematic analysis of the reports revealed four core meaning categories related to both guardians and animals: “animal behavior,” “household well-being and harmony,” “emotional symptoms of the guardians,” and “physical symptoms in the animals.” The guardians expressed that the experience was meaningful, providing greater self-awareness, a better understanding of the household environment, and a deeper connection with their pets. Regarding the animals, guardians reported significant behavioral improvements, such as increased calmness, serenity, playfulness, and happiness. Physical improvements were also observed, including reductions in diarrhea and appetite changes. Another notable outcome was improved integration of the animal within the household social dynamics.;It is concluded that the floral formulations used had a positive impact on both the guardians and their pets. Despite the limited number of participants, these findings are promising for future validation of the Animal Identity formulas for dogs and cats.;"Floral Therapy; Human–Animal Bond; Complementary and Integrative Medicine"

With this in mind, there is a need to better understand the health literacy of adults using TCIM, and this is best achieved through the use of validated TCIM health literacy instruments.  This study aims to identify the use and features of validated instruments for mearing the health literacy of the general adult population of TCIM users.;"A systematic review registered with PROSPERO; conducted across seven databases to include studies that sample adults (aged 18 years and over) from the public who use TCIM and report the use of a validated instrument which measures adult health literacy (including digital health literacy). Health Literacy instruments were reported using four domains i) Accessing or obtaining information, ii) Understanding information, iii) Processing/appraising information, and iv) Applying/employing information.  Guidelines from the COSMIN Risk of Bias checklist were adhered to for data extraction and instrument quality was assessed using the COSMIN checklist.";A total of 21 instruments were identified from 29 papers. Ten instruments were specific or partially specific to TCIM and related to TCIM disclosure, TCIM safety and efficacy, TCIM media influence, and more specifically to areas such as nutritional supplements, Traditional Chinese Medicine, and Acupuncture. Most HL instruments in this review assessed two or more HL domains (n=14), including five instruments that assessed all four HL domains. Approximately one quarter of all instruments received an overall assessment rating of `very good’ quality (n=5), with majority of instruments rating as either ‘doubtful’ (n=9) or ‘inadequate’ (n=7) quality;Investigating HL and specific HL instruments in relation to adult TCIM use and users will clearly benefit the TCIM research field and the wider health research community. Future research must focus efforts to develop validated TCIM-specific HL instruments which will ensure TCIM use and users are not excluded from HL scholarship and research advances.;"Adult Health Literacy; Validated instruments; Traditional Complementary and Integrative Medicine"

Outcome metrics comprised: (1) Composite efficacy endpoints (844 studies, 91.84%), including cure (437, 51.78%), marked improvement (440, 52.13%), improvement (738, 87.44%), no response (787, 93.25%), total effective rate (770, 91.23%), and self-resolution (1, 0.12%), with only 278 studies defining different efficacy outcomes, involving 52 types of definition criteria; (2) Symptom indicators (427 studies,46.46%), predominantly diarrhea (296, 69.32%), fever (280, 65.57%), vomiting (168, 39.34%); (3) Laboratory assessments (170 studies, 18.50%); featuring pathogen detection (80, 47.06%), immune markers (29, 17.06%); (4) additional endpoints (50 studies, 5.44%), e.g., hospitalization duration (27, 54.00%), disease course (20, 40.00%). ";This scoping review synthesizes evidence from 919 studies on TCM interventions for norovirus/acute enteric infections. The literature is predominantly composed by Chinese-language RCTs relying on heterogeneous, non-standardized composite efficacy endpoints as primary outcomes. This methodological limitation severely compromises evidence comparability and synthesis, fundamentally limiting evidence comparability and synthesis. TCM is primarily administered adjunctively with Western medicine, initiated early with short treatment durations. Chinese herbal formulas and patent medicines represent the core interventions, whereas objective laboratory assessments and patient-centered outcomes remain significantly underrepresented. Notably, despite limited research on single-herb interventions, all 4 international studies focused exclusively on this approach with balanced outcome metrics, suggesting its potential for global dissemination. Future research must prioritize core outcome sets with standardized metrics to establish clinically translatable evidence.;"Norovirus infections; Medicine; Chinese Traditional; Review Literature as Topic; Clinical Trials as Topic"

in the elderly and worsened by factors such as physical inactivity and poor nutrition. According to 
Ayurvedic medicine, this condition is associated with an imbalance of the doshas, especially Vata, and 
a deficiency of the muscle tissue (Mamsa Dhatu). Aging, reduced metabolism (Agni), and obstruction 
of the body's channels (Srotas) aggravate the condition. This review aimed to explore the therapeutic 
approaches of Ayurvedic medicine applied to the prevention and management of sarcopenia.";"This study adopts a narrative literature review approach, aiming to gather and discuss the main 
concepts and evidence related to the use of Ayurvedic medicine in the prevention and treatment of 
sarcopenia, particularly in elderly populations. Data collection was carried out through the selection 
of scientific articles, and academic publications, published between 2010 and 2025. Sources were 
obtained from databases such as PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, ResearchGate, Web of Science 
and journals specializing in Ayurveda and geriatrics. The main descriptors used included: Sarcopenia, 
Ayurveda, Panchakarma, Rasayana, Ashwagandha, Curcumin, Dinacharya, and Ayurvedic herbal

sarcopenia from an Ayurvedic perspective; ii. Ayurvedic interventions with therapeutic potential for 
maintaining or restoring muscle strength and mass; iii. Clinical trials, in vitro or in vivo studies on the 
effects of Rasayana herbs and traditional Ayurvedic compounds; iv. Preventive Ayurvedic approaches 
such as dinacharya, diet, and yoga/pranayama practices targeted at the elderly. Therefore, the 
methodological goal of this work is to integrate the millennia-old Ayurvedic tradition with modern 
scientific advances, providing a critical and informative foundation for future research and clinical 
applications focused on healthy aging and sarcopenia prevention.";"The study identified that Ayurvedic medicine offers effective approaches for managing sarcopenia, 
highlighting therapies such as Rasayana, Panchakarma, Yoga, and Pranayama. Herbal remedies like 
Ashwagandha, Amalaki, Shatavari, and Curcuma have shown potential in improving muscle strength, 
reducing inflammation, and slowing muscle degeneration. Daily Ayurvedic practices (Dinacharya) and 
a balanced diet also proved relevant in the prevention and control of sarcopenia. Despite the limited 
number of clinical trials in humans, the results suggest that integrating these strategies may promote 
healthy aging and help preserve muscle functionality in the elderly.";"The review indicates that Ayurvedic practices, including Rasayana, Panchakarma, herbal medicine,

Since 2017, osteopathy has been integrated into the Brazilian Unified Health System (SUS) as a complementary treatment. In pediatrics, evidence suggests its benefits for breastfeeding, reduction of intestinal colic, shorter hospitalization time in intensive care units, and decreased hospital costs. The osteopathic approach includes the assessment of somatic dysfunctions (SD), previously described in healthy newborns. The objective was to investigate which SD and neuromusculoskeletal alterations are present in children under five years old with microcephaly or susceptibility to the condition during osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT).;This is a quasi-experimental, pragmatic clinical study conducted between September 2022 and October 2023 at a public pediatric outpatient clinic at the Faculty of Medicine of Jundiaí (FMJ), São Paulo, Brazil. Children of both sexes who had never received OMT were included. The convenience sample was evaluated using the NE-O model, and records were based on the adapted Outpatient Osteopathic SOAP Note Form Series (SOAP). The assessment involved anamnesis, inspection, osteopathic palpatory evaluation, measurement of head circumference (HC), and craniometry using the MIMOS Br cranial caliper. Additionally, possible associations between SD and neuromusculoskeletal alterations with gestational age, type of delivery, head circumference, and birth weight were investigated. The study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee, approval no. 2.222.398, and registered in the Brazilian Registry of Clinical Trials (ReBEC) under number RBR-3zjz5qd;A total of 20 children were analyzed, with a mean gestational age of 37.5 weeks. Twelve children were between 24 and 36 months old, and 11 were female. Microcephaly was identified in nine children (45%), whose HC at birth was less than 31.0 cm, with eight presenting a larger anteroposterior cranial diameter. The most prevalent SD were found in the skull (85%), lower limbs (55%), and cervical region (45%). In the microcephaly group, a higher frequency of SD was observed in the thoracic region between T5-T9 (40%) compared to children without the condition. No statistically significant associations were found between SD and perinatal factors such as type of delivery or gestational age;Osteopathic assessment identified somatic dysfunctions in children with microcephaly, particularly in the craniocervical and mid-thoracic regions. The absence of statistically significant associations with perinatal factors suggests the multifactorial complexity of the condition, emphasizing the need for individualized approaches in monitoring these patients. Osteopathy demonstrates potential as a complementary resource for the evaluation and intervention of children with neuromusculoskeletal alterations associated with microcephaly or susceptibility to the condition. Future studies with larger samples, case-control designs, and longitudinal follow-up are necessary to validate these findings and investigate the impact of osteopathy on child development.;"Microcephaly; pediatrics; osteopathy; Outpatient Care"

Indigenous healing remains an option for Indigenous Peoples and is currently available in select medical clinics and with private practitioners; however, there are limited numbers of healers. A recent Ontario-based grassroots Indigenous policy statement articulates the time-immemorial practice of Indigenous healing and calls for mentorship and training to fill this gap. The Constitution Act of Canada advances language that recognizes and affirms existing Indigenous rights. This paper aims to call to action the right to Indigenous healing and thereby mobilize systems-level change in Indigenous healing, mentorship and training.  ";The method involves a review of ethnohistorical literature on historical practices related to the mentorship and training of Indigenous healers, both before and after the onset of settler colonialism in Ontario, Canada. This review contrasts the colonial policy and its legacy to eliminate Indigenous healing knowledge through the Indian Act of Canada, Residential Schools, and systemic racism, which displaced the central role of healing in Indigenous communities. Social movements in the 1970s and 1980s gradually voiced Indigenous perspectives on healing, and in the 1990s and 2000s, traditional healing options began to emerge in clinical and addiction treatment centres. In the 2020s, demand for traditional healers remains high, and there are accounts of healing programs struggling to find healers. ;Results from document analysis reveal various forms of traditional healing that rely on a system of mentorship based on training with experienced healers. The occurrence of a systematic healing system before colonization is consistent with the Constitutional qualifying discourse for the Indigenous practice of healing as a right. Contemporary Indigenous voices, particularly in the Indigenous policy statement, emphasize the interconnectedness of healing as an Indigenous right and the pressing need for support and mentorship in Indigenous healing. Indeed, Indigenous Peoples are calling for a systems-level pluralistic medical model inclusive of traditional healing options for Indigenous patients. ;New policy frameworks are a requirement to accommodate traditional healing in alignment with the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and Canada’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission’s Calls to Action. An outcome of this presentation is a direct call to participants in the Indigenous community and allies to collaborate on supporting systems-level changes in decolonizing Indigenous nation-settler-state relations by recognizing the right to autonomous Indigenous healing, mentorship, and training systems. ;"Medicine; Traditional; Education; Colonialism"

The main complications include posture, balance, and gait disorders, as well as speech and hearing difficulties, in addition to intellectual disability. Currently, there are no specific treatments, with early stimulation being the recommended approach. Osteopathy, through Osteopathic Manipulative Treatment (OMT), aims to correct somatic dysfunctions (SD), stimulate the body's self-regulation, and promote effects at multiple levels. Recognized by the World Health Organization (WHO) as part of Traditional and Complementary Medicine (T&CM), osteopathy is also integrated into the Brazilian Unified Health System (SUS). Evidence suggests that osteopathy, as a complementary therapy in pediatric care, may reduce hospitalization time and healthcare costs, as well as assist in improving intestinal colic and neurological disorders. However, there is still no substantial evidence regarding the use of osteopathy in the treatment of microcephaly and its consequences in pediatric outpatient settings. The objective of this study was to assess the effects of OMT on SD and neuromusculoskeletal alterations in children under five years old with microcephaly or susceptibility to the condition.;This is a quasi-experimental, pragmatic clinical trial conducted between September 2022 and October 2023 in a public pediatric outpatient clinic in Jundiaí, São Paulo, Brazil. The study involved osteopathic interventions in children of both sexes with microcephaly or susceptibility to the condition. It was approved by the Research Ethics Committee (CEP) of the Faculty of Medicine of Jundiaí (FMJ-SP) (no. 2.222.398) and registered in the Brazilian Registry of Clinical Trials (ReBEC) (no. RBR-3zjz5qd).;"Cranial somatic dysfunctions (SD) were identified in 17 children (85%), who also had lower weight and head circumference (HC) values in the three assessments, with no statistically significant differences. The number of SDs decreased from the 4th TMO (children 2, 3, 4, 7-11, 15, 16, 17, 19, 20). The variation in the number of SDs found and the children's development do not show a clear association with the children's ages, intervals between TMO, and treatment periods. However, each child can be considered individually as their control, reinforcing the individual approach of TMO. Changes in previously identified SD were observed, including changes in mobility, asymmetries, and cranial functions, as well as adjustments in the upper and middle thoracic spine and head circumference (HC) in 16 children. A qualitative improvement in craniofacial and postural development was observed, with no adverse effects reported. The children in this study received TMO at different intervals and in different amounts, ranging from 1 TMO (4 children) to 14 TMO (1). Four children received 3 TMO, 3 children received 4 TMO, and 6 children received 5 and 6 TMO, respectively.

";The findings indicate that osteopathy shows potential as a complementary approach in pediatric care for children with microcephaly or susceptibility to the condition. However, to generate more robust evidence regarding the beneficial effects of OMT in this population, clinical studies with larger samples, a qualitative-quantitative approach, controlled designs, and longitudinal follow-up are necessary.;"Microcephaly; pediatrics; osteopathy; Outpatient Care"

This traditional knowledge is rooted in the practice and skill of recognizing, cultivating, and using plants for various purposes—such as medicinal, nutritional, and ornamental applications—particularly for family care and personal health, including the treatment of climacteric symptoms. The climacteric refers to the transitional period from the reproductive to the non-reproductive phase and may represent up to one-third of a woman's life. Various common symptoms experienced during this period can significantly affect women's quality of life. Many women choose to use medicinal plants instead of hormone therapy, mainly due to the adverse effects associated with hormonal treatments. Ouro Preto (Minas Gerais, Brazil), a city recognized as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization), also holds valuable cultural heritage, including the traditional use of medicinal plants. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate local knowledge regarding medicinal plants used for the treatment of climacteric symptoms.;"The study was submitted to and approved by the Research Ethics Committee under number CAAE 56312916.8.0000.5150. This study involved 81 climacteric women residing in Ouro Preto, Minas Gerais, who were previously enrolled in a community outreach project by the Federal University of Ouro Preto (UFOP) focused on women's health. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews and guided tours. The plant species mentioned were collected by the participants and subsequently identified, herborized, and deposited in the OUPR Herbarium at UFOP. The reported uses were investigated through literature searches in the following databases: SciELO, PubMed, Google Scholar, and Scopus, using keywords that included the scientific names and their synonyms, along with the term ""medicinal"" in Portuguese, English, and Spanish.";"A total of 39 species, belonging to 25 families, were reported by the participating women as having some beneficial effect on alleviating climacteric symptoms. Among the most frequently cited species, mulberry (Morus nigra L.) and black cohosh (Actaea racemosa L.) stand out due to existing evidence supporting their effectiveness in reducing ""hot flashes,"" a common and distressing symptom experienced by climacteric women. Among the 39 cited species, 53% were associated with some type of toxicity, contraindications, or adverse effects; 37% showed no evidence of toxicity; and for 10%, no toxicity-related studies were found.";"The lack of conclusive studies on some of the species mentioned, such as sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum) and nasturtium (Tropaeolum majus), highlights the need for future pharmacological research. The existence of adverse effects and toxicity underscores the need for pharmaceutical guidance and medical supervision in the use of medicinal plants, in order to ensure the efficacy and safe application of this important resource.The results of this work contribute to the appreciation and conservation of knowledge about the use of plants, to improving the quality of life of women and strengthening the relationship between the university and the community.

This study aimed to examine how sociodemographic factors influence nutritional attitudes and behaviors among German-speaking adults.;In 2022, a nationally representative online cross-sectional survey was conducted with 4,065 German-speaking adults aged 18 to 75 years using a Computer Assisted Web Interview (CAWI) format. The questionnaire covered personal eating habits, the perceived importance of nutrition, motivations behind food choices, and openness to dietary changes. Data analysis involved descriptive statistics, CHAID decision tree analysis to identify key predictors, and nonparametric inferential methods for inductive evaluation.;Overall, 62.3% of participants regarded healthy nutrition as important. This positive attitude was particularly strong among women, those with higher education, and participants younger than 26 or older than 70 years. Education emerged as the most significant predictor of a positive attitude toward healthy eating, followed by gender and income, as shown by the CHAID analysis. Participants who valued healthy nutrition reported a higher health-related quality of life (HRQoL), with an average EQ-Index of 0.862, compared to 0.835 in those with neutral or negative attitudes. Regarding dietary habits, 10.5% of respondents identified as non-meat eaters, 28.6% as flexitarians, and 54.1% as omnivores. Plant-based diets were notably more prevalent among women. When asked about their main reasons for food choices, 77.2% cited taste as the leading factor. Approximately 18% indicated that they predominantly or exclusively purchased organic foods. Importantly, around one-third of participants expressed willingness to adopt a more plant-based diet if such a change was recommended by physicians or scientists. This suggests a considerable openness to dietary shifts under expert guidance.;The findings underscore the strong influence of sociodemographic factors, particularly education, gender, and income, on attitudes toward nutrition in Germany. The positive association between healthy nutrition attitudes and quality of life highlights the benefits of promoting nutrition awareness. Furthermore, the readiness of many individuals to follow expert dietary advice presents a promising opportunity for public health initiatives aimed at fostering healthier and more sustainable eating patterns. Tailored strategies that consider these demographic influences can enhance the effectiveness of nutrition-related health promotion in Germany.;"nutrition; Plant-based diet; Dietary behavior; survey; "

Based on machine learning algorithms, decision tree and random forest models were used to statistically analyze the relevant factors of real world data of childhood influenza. The factors affecting the clinical characteristics of traditional Chinese medicine treatment for childhood influenza were analyzed, and the relative importance of factors related to the effective of traditional Chinese medicine treatment for childhood influenza was explored. Real case data were obtained from confirmed pediatric cases and influenza-like cases that met the criteria between October 1, 2021 and September 30, 2022 in five hospitals in Beijing. ;"Based on machine learning algorithms, the relevant factors and relative importance affecting the efficacy of traditional Chinese medicine in treating children with influenza were analyzed. The data was confirmed pediatric cases from five hospitals in Beijing 2022.  
The results showed that the male to female ratio was 2:3; Children under 5 years old account for 75%; There was a significant statistical difference between the traditional Chinese medicine group and the control group. The efficacy related factors include age, height and weight, vaccination history, number of days with symptoms, frequency of respiratory diseases, average daily sleep time, timely medication, allergy history, one-child policy, medical history, academic burden, premature birth, and an average of 1 hour or more of high-intensity exercise per day. Obtain the relative importance of factors through SHAP analysis.The efficacy of Chinese medicine in treating children's influenza was remarkable. The treatment not only reduces fever quickly and has a higher rate of influenza virus conversion, but also effectively shorten the course of the disease, which was the clinical therapeutic effect remarkable. 
";Through machine learning algorithms, the relative importance of these factors was found to be 4.47, 3.35, 2.23, 1.89, 0.696, 0.643, 0.573, 0.455, 0.320, 0.264, 0.145, 0.09, and 0.06.Whether a child has been vaccinated against influenza, childhood allergy history, childhood medical history, maternal delivery status, and epidemiological history are risk factors for childhood influenza. Traditional Chinese medicine has a significant therapeutic effect on children with influenza. The efficacy of Chinese medicine in treating children's influenza is remarkable. The treatment not only reduces fever quickly and has a higher rate of influenza virus conversion, but also effectively shortens the course of the disease, which makes the clinical therapeutic effect remarkable. ;"childhood influenza; Traditional Chinese Medicine; fever reduction rate; Machine Learning"

This policy emphasizes the importance of placing individuals at the center of healthcare practices, fostering respect for subjectivity, autonomy, and the social and cultural contexts of patients. 

Despite this policy orientation, many health services still struggle to implement truly humanized care. One of the key challenges lies in the dominance of biomedical rationality, which often leads to a reductionist view of illness and care. In this context, traditional medicines — with their holistic, integrative, and patient-centered approaches — emerge as potential allies in overcoming the limitations of biomedicine and advancing the process of humanizing health care. 
";This is a theoretical and analytical study based on a critical review of literature and official documents related to the National Policy for the Humanization of Health Care and Management (Brazil, 2002), as well as academic works discussing the philosophical underpinnings of biomedicine and traditional medical systems. ;"Dehumanized care manifests in various ways within health services, especially through the difficulty that health professionals face in addressing aspects of the illness process that are meaningful to patients. When professionals reduce their focus to diagnosis or procedures alone, they neglect essential biopsychosocial dimensions. This reduction has several consequences: it impairs clinical decision-making by omitting relevant subjective information; weakens the therapeutic relationship; diminishes the patient's receptiveness to treatment proposals; and reinforces heteronomy instead of supporting patient autonomy.

These features suggest that the presence of other medical rationalities — whether through the integration of traditional practitioners into health services or through hybrid professional training — can significantly contribute to the humanization of care. Specifically, such integration may: 

    Encourage professionals to accept alternative perspectives and care models, including those brought by patients themselves.
    Broaden the scope of listening, valuing information that escapes the biomedical framework.
    Strengthen the therapeutic relationship by promoting trust and mutual understanding.
    Promote a more comprehensive and integrated approach to health care.
     ";In summary, traditional medicines, by largely rejecting the mechanistic and reductionist philosophies of biomedicine, offer valuable contributions to the process of humanizing health care. Their holistic, contextualized, and patient-centered approaches align with the goals of the National Policy for the Humanization of Health Care and Management, offering concrete strategies for improving the quality of interactions between professionals and patients. ;"traditional medicine; medical rationalities; Humanization of healthcare"

Previously, we evaluated MORE for lumbosacral radicular pain (LRP) and found that MORE reduced daily pain intensity but did not reduce disability (e.g., activities of daily living). Therefore, the current study aimed to develop a multicomponent intervention which integrated MORE with physical activity for patients with LRP: Move-MORE.;We employed a multi-phase, human-centered design approach to intervention development incorporating qualitative data from patients with LRP and pain-focused clinicians. Through stakeholder discussions with MORE facilitators, an initial draft of the Move-MORE manual was developed. To adapt the manual for patients with LRP, we conducted clinician interviews to gather insights on LRP treatment across healthcare disciplines, and patient focus groups to evaluate the pilot structure and content. Discussions with patient partners informed the development of the focus group guide. All interviews and focus groups were recorded and transcribed for rapid qualitative analysis. Using the Ecological Validity Model, we identified specific aspects of the Move-MORE program requiring modifications. Reasons for intervention modifications were assigned using the Person-Based Approach and were prioritized using MoSCoW criteria (Must have, Should have, Could have, Would like). We then collected patient-reported outcomes (PROs) for kinesiophobia (Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia-11), disability (Oswestry Disability Index), and illness representations (Illness Perceptions Questionnaire-Revised [IPQ-R]).;"Results: 9 clinician interviews were completed (2-physical therapists, 2-chiropractors, 2-pain psychologists, 1-pain management health coach, 1-acupuncturist, 1-physiatry physician’s assistant); mean age of 47.9±15 years, 11% female, 22% non-white, 15.3±12.7 years in practice. 15 patients with LRP participated in four focus groups; mean age 45.6±8.8, 93% female, 27% non-white, 47% reported income <$25,000/year, and 67% reported a previous disability insurance claim for their pain.

Key themes developed from the qualitative analysis included strategies for managing pain flares using mental and physical techniques, fostering individualized motivation for behavior change, and approaches to promote physical activity among chronic pain patients. Patient participants shared meaningful insights, including: “It was interesting that when we focused on an area I noticed the tension, and just noticing it—the act of noticing—was the release that it needed.”  Participants commonly reported recognizing that mindfulness may bring up discomfort or memories of trauma, and finding value in normalizing these experiences rather than pathologizing them.

On average, the sample had moderate kinesiophobia (30.3±4.4) and severe disability (23.5±7.2). On the IPQ-R subscales, the sample reported perceiving their condition as long-term, significantly impacting their daily life, occurring in a cyclical manner with worsening symptoms and remission, and conferring an emotional burden. 

Discussion: Findings from interviews, focus groups, and PROs guided refinements to the Move-MORE intervention. Stakeholders emphasized the value of combining mindfulness and movement to address pain and kinesiophobia. Moderate-to-severe kinesiophobia and disability further support a multicomponent approach.";Developing multicomponent pain management interventions benefits from the involvement of multiple stakeholders and iterative feedback. This mixed-methods study led to a patient-informed intervention for LRP.  Move-MORE will now be evaluated in a single-arm pilot trial to assess feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy.;"Mindfulness Based Interventions; Physical activity; Low back Pain; Chronic Pain"

This transitional period also increases the risk of anxiety and depression, negatively affecting women's quality of life. Although menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) is commonly recommended to manage these symptoms, its use is often limited by contraindications and potential adverse effects. As a result, aromatherapy has gained attention as a complementary and integrative approach for symptom relief and quality of life improvement. This pilot study aimed to evaluate the effects of inhaling Citrus sinensis essential oil on anxiety, depression, and overall quality of life in climacteric women.;Thirty-three women aged between 40 and 65 years who scored ?10 on the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) and/or ?11 on the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) were randomly assigned to one of two groups: aromatherapy (AG) (n=16) or control (CG) (n=17). The AG received inhalation treatment for 10 minutes, adding five drops of Citrus sinensis essential oil to a diffuser for eight weekly sessions, The CG underwent the same procedure using sweet almond vegetable oil. Participants in both groups were also provided with a bottle of their respective oil for daily home use and instructed to place five drops on a piece of paper to be left beside their pillow overnight. Validated questionnaires were used to assess climacteric symptoms (Menopause Rating Scale – MRS), anxiety (BAI), depression (BDI), and quality of life (Utian Quality of Life Scale – UTIAN). Anthropometric and blood pressure measurements were also recorded. All assessments were conducted at baseline (T0) and after eight weeks of treatment (T8). Data were analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics, version 25.0.;"Thirty-three climacteric women completed the 8-week follow-up and were included in the analysis (16 in the AG and 17 in the CG). While the AG exhibited more pronounced effects, both groups showed a significant reduction (p < 0.05) in anxiety (?12 points in both groups), depression (?14.5 points in the AG and ?12.8 in the CG), and climacteric symptom scores (?13.4 points in the AG and ?9.7 in the CG). However, only the aromatherapy group demonstrated a significant improvement in quality of life, as measured by the UTIAN questionnaire (from 71.38?±?12.16 to 80.75?±?10.75; p = 0.014). No significant changes in anthropometric and blood pressure measurements were observed in either group. The improvements observed in the CG may be attributed to the relaxing environment of the sessions, a possible placebo effect, and the shared aromatherapy application method.";The findings suggest that Citrus sinensis essential oil inhalation may improve quality of life in climacteric women. Further studies with larger sample sizes are needed to confirm these results and better understand the therapeutic potential of this intervention.

Current qualitative studies mostly focus on symptom management and basic disease perceptions, overlooking patient-centered treatment expectations, therapeutic process perceptions, and doctor-patient interaction impacts during manual therapy. This study aims to address these gaps by exploring Chinese KOA patients' experiences, perceptions, and expectations of manual therapy, emphasizing contextual factors affecting therapeutic outcomes and interactions.;Participants with KOA were sampled using a simple sampling method from a randomized controlled trial of Tuina treatment versus manual physical therapy (MPT). The interviews were conducted by two researchers who have extensive experience interviewing KOA patients, and data were gathered through face-to-face, semi-structured interviews to ensure a high level of information power. Three experienced researchers subsequently analyzed employing thematic analysis to assess patient experiences and outcomes from both treatment modalities.The study interviewed a total of 61 participants, thematic saturation was reached when interviewing 42 participants, and seven codes along with 5 sub-themes were utilized to depict potential doctor-patient interactions and influencing factors.

While its therapeutic applications are well-established, its diagnostic potential remains underexplored. This study aims to investigate the correlation between abdominal organ diseases and corresponding auricular regions in patients with acute abdominal pain, seeking to assess the diagnostic utility of auricular assessment.;This prospective, double-blind, observational pilot study was conducted from May 2022 to August 2023. Patients presenting with abdominal pain in the emergency department and meeting specific inclusion criteria were recruited. The auricular examination (AE) involved palpating the concha and helix areas for tender points corresponding to abdominal organs based on Nogier and Bahr's auricular map. Sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios were calculated by correlating identified tender points with diagnoses.;Of the 152 screened patients, 104 (68%) received a specific diagnosis related to abdominal organs. For all organs with more than five patients included, the correlating locations identified by Nogier and Bahr were either among the most common or the most sensitive points. High sensitivities were observed for conditions affecting the stomach (93%), small intestine (91%), and liver (71%). Specificities were high for certain organs, such as the ureter (86%) and gallbladder (70%), with relevant positive and negative likelihood ratios for the stomach and appendix.;This study demonstrates a possible correlation between abdominal organ diseases and specific auricular regions defined by Nogier and Bahr. Auricular assessment could potentially be added as a non-invasive complementary diagnostic tool. However, further studies with larger cohorts are needed to assess the correlation. ;"Auricular diagnosis; auricular acupuncture; abdominal pain; somatotopy"

Rudolf Steiner, the founder of Anthroposophy, proposed a four-ingredient cream for ulcerative tumors that includes  L. nummularia’s aerial parts [2]. Given the interest in the traditional uses of this plant, this study aimed to characterize its morphoanatomy to help with its proper identification and quality control.;Leaves, stems and flowers of L. nummularia were collected in Nuglar and in Dornach, Switzerland. A voucher was prepared, kept and then identified in Basel University’s Herbarium (Switzerland), under the registration number of BASBG-00090509. The material was fixed [3] and stored in 70% ethanol (V/V). For staining, astra blue and basic fuchsin were used [4]. The sections were done freehand. For scanning electron microscopy (SEM), fresh material was fixed, dehydrated in a graded ethanol series [5], dried at the critical point, gold-coated, and examined at the University of Basel.;"Lysimachia nummularia is an herbaceous perineal, ground covering creeping plant. Leaves are simple, opposite, membranaceous and oval to rounded shaped, with acute to obtuse apex and reentrant base, entire margins, pinnate veins, green colored. Single flowers are found linked to the stem by a simple pedicel to a regular, dialissepal and campanulated chalice, formed by 5 small greenish sepals. The regular rosaceous corolla has five yellow petals with an acute to obtuse apex and smooth texture. There are five stamens, united in adelphy. The anthers are sagittate and valved, tapering more at the apex. The pistil has a globose ovary, a terminal style, and a penicillate stigma. In the leaf’s surface view, both epidermis present thin and sinuous anticlinal cell walls, covered by a thin cuticle, with anomocytic stomata on both sides. In cross-section, the mesophyll is dorsiventral, composed by one layer of palisade parenchyma and 3-4 layers of spongy parenchyma. The epidermis has rounded cells covered by a thin cuticle, on both sides. Capitate glandular trichomes are present only on abaxial side. Secretory cavities are observed in the mesophyll. The midrib, in cross-section, is concave-convex, with a collateral vascular bundle in open arc with two lateral traces. The stem, in cross-section, is irregularly shaped, and stomata and glandular trichomes also happen in the epidermis; secretory cavities are also present in the cortex; the collateral vascular bundle is surrounded by an endodermis. Starch grains are present in the cortex and the pith.  The petals epidermis also present thin and sinuous anticlinal cell walls, covered by a thin cuticle, in surface view. Although, differently from the leaves, the petals have capitate trichomes on both sides of their epidermis. These glandular trichomes are also present in the filament of the anther.";This study highlights the importance of morphoanatomical analysis in the quality control of L. nummularia.

A polyphenol-rich hydroalcoholic extract obtained from the leaves of Thalassia testudinum marine plant has shown effective photoprotection properties against UV radiation, a precursor of skin cancer. Until now, biomass harvesting from its natural habitat may endanger biodiversity and sustainability of this species. However T. testudinum proves invaluable ecosystem services. testudinum cultivated in vitro were compared to the one from natural sources in regard to phytochemical composition and biological activity. ;Plant material was harvested the Protected Natural Landscape “Rincón de Guanabo”. Cultivation of T. testudinum explants was tested in marine aquariums with natural substrate. Several trials were conducted under different aeration, lighting, temperature, and nutrient conditions. The appearance of shoots and the macro and micromorphology of the explants were studied. Extracts was prepared from natural or in vitro derived biomass, HPLC phytochemical characterization and biological activity were evaluated in A375 tumoral cell line;The explants were viable for up to 12 months with substrate, aeration and 16/8 hours of light/darkness cycles. No differences were observed in the chemical composition from the naturally grown to the in vitro samples regarding Thalassiolin B concentration. The hydroalcoholic extract from the in vitro culture presented the highest percentage of this compound compared to the other extracts evaluated. Thalassiolin B content was higher in the leaves than in the rhizome. Viability of A375 cells in the hydroalcoholic extract from the in vitro-produced biomass resembled the one from natural sources, while IC50 in the rhizome-derived extract was approximately 5-fold higher than the one obtained from the leaves. Reports on T. testudinum culture under artificial controlled conditions have just addressed the biomass production and the micro-macro morphology characterization of the produced explants. The photoprotection and other bioactivities described for this extract has been associated, at least in part, to the phenolic compounds from the plant secondary metabolites. Therefore, the increased content of Thalassiolin B described here for the in vitro-derived biomass in addition to apigenin, luteolin and chrysoeriol, already identified within the extract in a previous study, can be assumed to exert the increased biological effect.;The establishment of in vitro aquaponics under controlled artificial conditions and the 12 months survival of explants of the T. testudinum marine angiosperm are possible by using biotechnological alternatives through plant tissue culture for biomass production. Leaves are the most interesting organ for the production of pharmaceutical products due to their high content of Thalassiolin B. In vitro culture might be a sustainable source of plant material for the development of new complementary medicine formulations. ;"Thalassia testudinum; alternative metabolite production; plant in vitro culture"

This work shows studies carried out to support the antitumor efficacy of the extract and its safety margin. ;Whole dry and ground T. testudinum leaves collected in “Guanabo” beach were extracted with EtOH-H2O (50:50, v/v) for 24 h at room temperature. The extract was filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure at 40°C to yield crude extract. Its effects on cell viability was measured by MTT assay in normal and tumor cells. Cells were exposure for 48 hours to 10-1000 µg/mL of the extract. By chicken chorioallantoic membrane angiogenesis and wound closure assays and a transcriptome profiling and pathway analysis, the mechanisms involved were evaluated. In vivo effects were tested in CT26 cells, which were inoculated subcutaneously to Balb/c mice. Doses of T. testudinum extract (100 and 200 mg/kg) were orally administered to animals during 14 days.;T. testudinum extract significantly prevented basal and bFGF-induced angiogenesis in the chicken chorioallantoic membrane angiogenesis assay. In addition, the extract suppressed bFGF induced migration of endothelial cells in a wound closure assay. Finally, T. testudinum extract treatment abrogates CT26 colorectal cancer growth and increased overall organism in a syngeneic murine allograft model. Corresponding transcriptome profiling and pathway analysis allowed to identify a first mechanism of action for the anti-tumor effects of the extract. In line with our in vitro/in vivo results, T. testudinum extract treatment triggers ATF4-P53-NF?B specific gene expression and autophagy stress pathways. Transcriptome profiling and systems biology approaches were used to characterize in vitro/in vivo antitumor activities of a extract of T. testudinum growing in the Cuban coasts. In the T. testudinum extract treated SW480 cells, the extract triggers multiple stress pathways (unfolded protein stress, endoplasmic reticulum stress, nitrosative stress, DNA damage), which exceed stress tolerance of colon cancer cells. Studies show that phytochemicals, including constituents of T. testudinum, can efficiently modulate autophagy-dependent cancer cell death. In vivo, additional role for immune signaling pathways (IFN?, PD-1, ZAP70) and myeloid leukocyte activation-migration into the tumor microenvironment to promote immunogenic cell death was observed.;"T. testudinum is a promising source of new drug candidates for diseases controlling with high morbidity and mortality in humans.

One extract obtained from its leaves is rich in polyphenolic compounds and it has shown bioactive potential as antioxidant, photoprotective and antitumor. This work had the objective of evaluating the anti-inflammatory activity of the T. testudinum extract in inflammation models in vitro and in vivo, as well as in silico modeling of the chemical interactions between the main phytocompounds of the extract with the TNF-TNFR1 complex. ;Whole dry and ground T. testudinum leaves collected in “Guanabo” beach were extracted with EtOH-H2O (50:50, v/v) for 24 h at room temperature. The extract was filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure at 40°C to yield crude extract. The effects of T. testudinum extract on the NF-kB transcriptional activity were determined by luciferase reporter gene assays in transfected cell lines, murine fibrosarcoma L929sA (p(IL6?B)350 hu.IL6P-luc+) and human monocytes U937-3kB-Luc differentiated into macrophages. The effects of oral administration were evaluated in models of l-carrageenan-induced plantar edema in male OF-1 mice and in cotton pad-induced granuloma in male Balb/c mice.  Protein-ligand docking was performed using AutoDock Vina v1.2.0 software, assessing the binding of four ligands (polyphenols identified in the extract) to the active site of TNF-? and TNFR1.;Cells exposure to T. testudinum extract concentrations between 20 and 200 ? g/mL significantly inhibited the expression of the NF-kB reporter gene, both in TNF-? stimulated L929sA cells and in U937-3?B-Luc cells differentiated into macrophages in the presence of PMA and activated with LPS. In addition, T. testudinum extract (5-100 mg/kg, 10 mL/kg) showed dose-dependent anti-inflammatory action in the carrageenan-induced plantar edema model in male OF-1 mice. Furthermore, repeated doses (50-200 mg/kg, 10 mL/kg) of the extract prevented chronic inflammation established in the cotton pad-induced granuloma model in Balb/c mice. From molecular docking analyses, it was determined that the polyphenols identified in the extract selectively interacted with amino acids in the active site of TNF-?, showing free energy values of binding in a range of -8.0 to -10.0 Kcal/mol. The anti-inflammatory action observed was due, at least in part, to the inhibition of mediators of the inflammatory response. Phenolic compounds are plant secondary metabolites known for their anti-inflammatory properties, through regulation by NF-kB pathway. Thalassiolin B, apigenin, luteolin and criosoriel were identified in the extract in a previous study. Therefore, it can be assumed that the anti-inflammatory effect by the extract was due to these compounds. Based on these results, products derivate from T. testudinum represent potential natural sources that will be useful for the treatment of inflammatory-related diseases.;These results constituted experimental evidence which supports the extract obtained from T. testudinum as a promising source of natural anti-inflammatory products.;"Thalassia testudinum; anti-inflammatories; phytocomponents; TNF-TNFR1"

A nutraceutical DLBS 3233 containing Lagerstroemia speciosa and Cinnamomum burmannii has shown glucose-lowering effects in preclinical studies and is popular among patients in our setting, though human efficacy and safety data are limited. This study aimed to evaluate this nutraceutical in prediabetes management.;This retrospective study examined outpatient data from a single secondary hospital, spanning December 2019 to February 2025. It included adult prediabetes patients (aged over 18) who were receiving either metformin or the nutraceutical DLBS3233. Included patients had complete medical records (HbA1c, fasting glucose or oral glucose tolerance test/OGTT, or estimated glomerular filtration rate/eGFR, alanine transaminase/ALT tests). Propensity matching (gender, minimum therapy duration of three months, baseline ALT therapy <30 mg/dL, and eGFR >60mL/minute/1.73m2) balanced the two groups. Resolution of prediabetes (normal HbA1c and/or fasting glucose/OGTT) was the primary outcome. ;"Of the 382 patients screened, 210 were included in the study (105 in each treatment arm). Metformin group received a daily dose of 1000mg (mean age 39.32 ± 13.1, BMI 26.5 ± 3.2, therapy duration 4.4 ± 1.5 months). Nutraceutical DLBS3233 group received a daily dose of 100mg (mean age 40.05 ± 13.4, BMI 26.7 ± 3.03, therapy duration 4.5 ± 1.4 months). Few patients (<3%) in both groups received simvastatin.
The primary outcome was significantly more pronounced in the nutraceutical group [87/105 (82.9%)] compared to metformin [69/105 (65.7%)] (p < 0.05). Logistic regression in the nutraceutical group showed that the therapy duration and hypercholesterolemia treatment did not affect results, while therapy duration in the metformin group did (p=0.001).
Safety analysis showed no serious side effects or significant changes in liver/kidney function in either group. Mild dizziness (6/105) was the most common side effect in the nutraceutical group, while bloating and nausea (85/105) dominated in the metformin group.
Preclinical study have shown that DLBS3233, a standardized herbal extract of L. speciosa and C. burmannii, lowers blood glucose by acting as an insulin sensitizer through peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR?) modulation. The findings of this study further support its beneficial effects and suggest that DLBS3233 could be an alternative for patients with metformin intolerance.
";The nutraceutical DLBS3233 containing Lagerstroemia speciosa and Cinnamomum burmannii was well-tolerated and may be beneficial in prediabetes management. Due to the limitation of retrospective design, a randomized controlled study is still needed for confirmation.;"prediabetes; DLBS3233; metformin"

It is a secondary analysis of the BrainFit-Nutrition study, a randomized controlled trial comparing two dietary approaches—a Whole Food Plant-Based (WFPB) diet versus a diet following German Nutrition Association (DGE) guidelines—and two types of computer-based cognitive training. While the original trial focused on cognitive performance, this analysis investigates changes in dietary habits over time.;Dietary behaviors were assessed at baseline (t0), six months post-intervention (t6), and at a 12-month follow-up (t12) via food frequency questionnaires. Participants received bi-weekly synchronized online nutritional counseling over six months and were assigned to either the WFPB or DGE dietary group. Short- and long-term dietary changes were analyzed by comparing consumption frequencies of various food categories between groups, using ANCOVAs with baseline values as covariates for exploratory analysis.;The study included 261 participants (52.2% female), aged 60 to 86 years, all diagnosed with MCI. Most participants maintained an omnivorous diet, with minor shifts toward pescatarian, ovolacto-vegetarian, and vegan diets. By t12, the WFPB group showed a slight increase in vegan participants (from 2% to 6%) and ovolacto-vegetarians (from 5% to 9%), while the DGE group remained stable in diet classification. Vegetable, fruit, and whole grain consumption stayed stable in both groups, averaging about 14 servings per week for vegetables and 10 for fruits, with no significant differences. Meat consumption significantly decreased in both groups, more so in the WFPB group—from 5.8 servings weekly at baseline to 2.4 at t6 and 2.1 at t12. The DGE group saw a smaller decline, from 5.6 to 4.3 at t6 and 3.9 at t12. Fish intake reduced from 3.1 to 1.5 servings per week in the WFPB group by t12, compared to 3.0 to 2.4 in the DGE group. Egg consumption similarly declined, from 4.2 to 2.0 servings in the WFPB group, and 4.1 to 3.5 in the DGE group.;Structured nutritional counseling can promote healthier eating habits in individuals with MCI, especially reducing meat, fish, and egg consumption. However, differences between the WFPB and DGE diets were less impactful than the overall effect of participating in a dietary intervention. Further research is needed to clarify how dietary changes affect cognitive health and to tailor nutritional recommendations for this population.;"MCI; plant-based nutrition; dietary patterns; nutrition counseling; "

Beyond conventional treatments such as in vitro fertilization (IVF), there is growing interest in whether therapeutic fasting could provide supportive benefits. However, recruitment for interventional studies exploring fasting in the context of fertility treatment has proved challenging. In this qualitative study we explored medical professionals´ attitude towards fasting and other complementary approaches in fertility treatment.;Methods: To explore the perspectives of medical professionals, qualitative data were collected through semi-structured interviews. Transcripts were inductively coded using MAXQDA and thematically analyzed based on Braun and Clarke’s approach. Quality was ensured using the COREQ checklist and regular consultation with the research team and experienced qualitative researchers.;Results: Many interviewees perceived therapeutic fasting as an additional burden or even a form of distress for patients undergoing fertility treatment. Doubts and limited knowledge about fasting among fertility specialists were common, though some acknowledged potential benefits, such as weight loss and improved chances of conception. There was a general openness toward complementary and integrative approaches in fertility care. Interestingly this was not reflected in their recommendations to patients. The interviews also revealed that the professionals generally had their focus on female infertility rather than including both sexes in their thinking.;Conclusion: These insights help explain recruitment difficulties in studies addressing integrative approaches,  which are still being rarely used in fertility care. To encourage more openness, it may be important to improve knowledge about fasting and other complementary approaches, address existing concerns, and better recognize patients’ interest in complementary treatment options.;"fasting; qualitative research; infertility"

It was a retrospective study approved by the Ethics Committee of Beijing University of Chinese Medicine (2023BZYLL1210). We included all the records confirmed with influenza A and/or B via throat swab. Data on demographics, diagnoses, and prescriptions were processed using Excel 2021, and visualized with OriginPro 2025 and Excel 2021.;"The results were primarily presented in the form of visual charts and data. A total of 2,568 clinical records showed a male-to-female ratio of 0.93:1. CPMs occupy 77.88% of total prescriptions (83.86% in minors). Prescription peaks occurred between October 2023 and April 2024, with 1,753 cases (68.26%) being diagnosed in influenza A/B. Diagnostic tests were ordered in 517 cases (20.13%), primarily chest CT for adults (367,84.56%) versus chest X-rays for minors (68,81.93%). Western medications prioritized anti-influenza A/B virus medicines (1495,58.22%) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs, 1112, 43.30%).

A ten-year bibliometric analysis .;There is increasing interest in the medicinal use of cannabis sativa and its derivatives, because of their reported effects in chronic diseases with complex management, such as refractory seizures, cancer-related nausea and vomiting, oncological pain, or mental disorders (anxiety, stress). The cannabis plant participates in multiple physiological processes, usually related to the human cannabinoid system, because of the presence of numerous active compounds, called cannabinoids as ?(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD). Instead of its qualification as a psychoactive plant or its relationship with substance use disorder cases, the medicinal use of cannabis was legalized in numerous countries in Latin America, such as Brazil, Uruguay, Chile, Argentina, Colombia, Paraguay, and Peru. In this context, scientific knowledge generation is necessary to distinguish between recreational use (with its widely known adverse effects) and medicinal use. However, the preconception about this plant, associated with limited research resources in the region, affects and retards all related initiatives. Consequently, the study aimed to describe the characteristics of production and collaboration in scientific research related to the medicinal use of cannabis in Latin America from 2015 to 2024. ;A bibliometric analysis, from a systematic search in five databases (Web of Science, Scopus, PubMed, SciELO, and LILACS), including all the scientific production (original articles, brief reports and case reports) in the medicinal use of cannabis, developed in all the countries from Latin America and the Caribe. Research about synthetic cannabinoids or with outcomes not related to health was excluded. The evaluated bibliometric indicators were: publication year, scientific journals of publication, institutional affiliations, country, research type, and funding. Additionally, a thematic analysis was made through a wordcloud, and a collaboration analysis was developed through clustering and networks (by authors, institutions, and countries). ;316 publications from 10 countries were included, with Brazil being the most productive (66,5%), and showing a crescent trend of research output over the 10 years that were studied. The most productive institution was the Universidade de São Paulo (USP), and 15.5% of publications did not refer any funding. The most productive sources were: Cannabis and Cannabinoid Research (5.1%), Neuropharmacology (4.4%), and  Behavioural Brain Research (3.2%). 66.9% of studies were qualified as pre-clinical research, and 5.7% were clinical trials. 18 clusters of co-authorship, 27 clusters of institutions, and four clusters of countries' collaboration were founded. ;"Scientific production on the medicinal use of cannabis in Latin American and Caribbean countries between 2015 and 2025 has shown an upward trend, with Brazil and Argentina as the main focus of development. Most studies have been publicly funded, and clinical trials have been underway since 2018. Collaboration between authors and institutions is ongoing; hubs such as the University of São Paulo and the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro offer opportunities for collaboration with external entities and potential funding for research initiatives.";"Medicinal cannabis; bibliometric analysis; cannabinoids"

For integration to be effective, it is essential to understand the underlying factors that influence individuals to seek and sustain TCIM use. This review aimed to identify the most influential determinant of TCIM utilization and to explore its implications for system-level integration.;A systematic umbrella review was conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. Searches were performed in PubMed, Embase, and reference lists to identify peer-reviewed systematic reviews published between January 2005 and March 2024 in English or Arabic. Included reviews were critically appraised using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) checklist. A factor was considered highly influential if it appeared consistently across diverse populations and regions and demonstrated conceptual robustness beyond specific contextual settings.;"A total of 62 systematic reviews were included, synthesizing findings from over 2,800 primary studies conducted across diverse populations and geographic regions. Five key factors influencing TCIM use were identified: socioeconomic status, dissatisfaction with conventional care, internal locus of control, preference for natural or holistic approaches, and perceived usefulness. Among these, perceived usefulness, defined as an individual’s belief that a TCIM modality is useful for a specific health need, emerged as the most consistent and globally relevant determinant of TCIM use. Across contexts, individuals were unlikely to adopt TCIM unless they perceived it to have a specific benefit, even when scientific validation was lacking.
This determinant, perceived usefulness, has significant implications for integration of TCIM into healthcare. For TCIM to be meaningfully embedded, integration strategies must reflect and support community-defined values. Health authorities can use perceived usefulness to identify not only which TCIM modalities are most used and trusted but also the specific benefits people believe they offer. Developing national profiles based on these perceptions can help align policies with real-world demand and cultural health priorities. Aligning research agendas and resource allocation with perceived benefits further bridges the gap between lived experience and scientific evidence, enabling safe, evidence-based integration of trusted TCIM practices into mainstream care. Moreover, perceived usefulness supports long-term engagement. Individuals who view TCIM as beneficial are more likely to adhere to these treatments and incorporate them into their broader care plans—enhancing outcomes, satisfaction, and the sustainability of integration. This approach promotes patient engagement, continuity of care, and health system responsiveness—critical elements of successful integration. Ultimately, emphasizing perceived usefulness can build trust in both TCIM and conventional healthcare, fostering more inclusive, culturally responsive, and effective health systems that meaningfully advance universal health coverage.";Perceived usefulness is a globally consistent factor underpinning TCIM use and should be considered the cornerstone of TCIM integration into healthcare systems. Strengthening public health through TCIM requires acknowledging the perceived benefits and lived experiences that shape individuals’ health decisions. Integration efforts that reflect these community-based perceptions can align services with local norms, support continuity of care, and advance global health goals, while honoring the diverse ways people understand healing and wellness.;"Integrative Medicine; complementary medicine; traditional medicine; patient-centered care; Public Health"

Even considering the clinical manifestations of the subtle bodies, medical imaging techniques may constitute an important tool for diagnosis and follow-up of the therapies, which also applies to other integrative methods. Specially considering the metabolic conditions, physiologic manifestations in the diagnosis and follow-up of the patients. As example, brain FDG-PET/CT images can reveal metabolic alterations in the diagnosis phase and after anthroposophic therapies; diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) can show the differences between the water molecule transit in different pathological conditions, considering different organs and tissues.  In this context, this study brings examples of the role of the medical imaging techniques to describe the metabolic manifestations related to neurological and other metabolic manifestations. Furthermore, the work aims to bring to the Integrative Medicine Community an overview of the new medical imaging diagnostic techniques as relevant tools in the initial stage and follow-up of anthroposophic and other integrative therapies.";This work brings a review and examples of cases where the medical imaging techniques (computed tomography, nuclear medicine, magnetic resonance imaging, etc.) are applied to characterize the metabolic and anatomical process approached by the anthroposophic and other integrative medicine methods. The neurological conditions as such as encephalitis, paraneoplastic syndromes, tumors and epilepsy are examples of clinical manifestations that can get benefits from these techniques, not restricted to neurology. The presentation also brings the main basis of the new medical images and their potentialities to improve the definition of the therapeutical approaches and follow-up of the patients submitted to the integrative medicine therapies.;"The study verified that anthroposophic and other integrative medicine techniques can leverage new imaging techniques in several ways, as such as complementing qualitative assessments, validating the patient's condition, the comprehension of physical body, despite the complementary views of different integrative methods, acting as new lens to integrate the understanding of the subtle bodies. In the neurological approaches, nuclear medicine images, as such as PET/CT, have expressed a relevant role to characterize the brain metabolic conditions before and after the use of integrative medicine methods. In a case of patient with autoimmune ancephalities, it was possible to observe notable metabolic changes in the brain. 
Furthermore, these methods bring answers and tools to elaborate a personalized treatment planning, as well as to improve the mechanisms of early detection and prevention of diseases used in the integrative practices, also allowing the constant monitoring of the therapeutic effectiveness and validation of the integrative therapeutical approaches, reinforcing their importance in various scientific fields.";New medical imaging techniques and tools offer powerful objective insights into the physical and physiological aspects of health. For integrative and anthroposophic medicine approaches, these tools can serve as valuable complements, aiding in diagnosis, personalized treatment planning, monitoring progress, and potentially contributing to research that bridges the gap between conventional and holistic understandings of health.;"Integrative Practices; Medical Imaging Techniques; Anthroposophic Medicine"

Among complementary health approaches, osteopathic manipulative treatment seeks to evaluate and manage individuals globally, aiming to reduce symptoms and restore functional balance. Despite its clinical use, there is a scarcity of high-quality studies assessing the effectiveness of osteopathy in chronic musculoskeletal conditions. Considering the high number of patients affected and the impact of pain on daily life, this study aimed to investigate the effects of osteopathic treatment on quality of life, assessed through the WHOQOL-Bref questionnaire.;"Methods
	•	Design: Randomized clinical trial
	•	Setting: Osteopathy Clinic – Brazilian Institute of Osteopathy, University Hospital of Santa Catarina
	•	Participants: 20 patients with chronic pain
	•	Study Group (SG): n = 10
	•	Control Group (CG): n = 10
	•	Randomization: Participants randomly allocated into SG and CG
	•	Assessment tool: WHOQOL-BREF (Quality of Life Questionnaire)
	•	Applied at baseline (pre-treatment)
	•	Applied at the end of the protocol (post-treatment)
	•	Intervention:
	•	SG: 4 osteopathic medical treatments
	•	CG: no intervention for 2 months
";"Results
	•	Between-group comparison: No statistically significant differences (p > 0.05) were found between the Study Group (SG) and Control Group (CG) in baseline or final WHOQOL-BREF scores.
	•	Within-group comparison: Neither SG nor CG showed significant changes between baseline and final assessments.
	•	Trend: The SG presented higher mean values in all quality-of-life domains (physical, psychological, social relationships, and environment) at the final evaluation, despite the lack of statistical significance.
	•	Direction of findings: Results suggest a potential positive effect of osteopathic treatment, though interpretation should be cautious due to the small sample size.

?

Discussion
	•	Although statistical significance was not achieved, the findings indicate a positive trend in favor of the osteopathic intervention, with higher mean scores in the SG across all domains of quality of life.
	•	The absence of significant results may be explained by the small sample size (n=20), which limited the statistical power of the study to detect subtle differences.
	•	Previous research has also reported benefits of osteopathy in managing chronic pain and improving quality of life, but highlights the need for larger randomized clinical trials with extended follow-up to strengthen the evidence.
	•	The present study suggests that osteopathic treatment may contribute to improvements in multidimensional aspects of well-being, reinforcing the relevance of further investigations with more robust designs.";"Conclusion
	•	There was no significant difference between CG and SG regarding quality of life outcomes.
	•	However, the Study Group showed a positive trend, with consistently higher mean scores in all domains at the end of the protocol.
	•	Findings suggest potential benefits of osteopathic treatment, although a larger sample size may be required to confirm statistical significance.";"Quality of Life; Osteopathic Medicine; Chronic Pain"

In China, medical pluralism is widespread. Caregivers of sick children often seek treatment from both biomedicine and traditional Chinese medicine practitioners. One traditional medicine practice is pediatric Tuina, a soft massage technique administered by trained providers, which has been used to prevent new respiratory infections. However, there is limited understanding of caregivers' perspectives on pediatric Tuina. By examining their healthcare-seeking patterns, this research aims to understand what are the reasons of caregivers in Southern China turn to pediatric Tuina for their children’s recurrent respiratory tract infections.;A qualitative descriptive interview design was used in this study. Participants were recruited using a convenience sampling technique. Sixteen mothers from Southern China, whose children had undergone pediatric Tuina in a clinical trial for recurrent respiratory tract infections, participated in online semi-structured interviews. Informed consent was obtained by first explaining the study's purpose to caregivers over the phone, followed by the exchange of signed printed forms via express delivery. The analysis was conducted using reflexive thematic analysis with NVivo qualitative research software. ;The results indicate that caregivers primarily seek pediatric Tuina because they adopt a proactive and child-centered approach in choosing the appropriate type of care for sick children. Caregivers preferred self-learning of care and home remedies to avoid hospital visits, when the symptoms were mild. They typically sought hospital care when symptoms such as cough or fever appeared, as these are viewed as indicators for medical attention. Caregivers tended to favor healthcare providers who offer tailored treatment plans and demonstrate a positive attitude. Due to the recurring and prolonged nature of the illness, along with access to multiple types of providers, caregivers prefer a combination, turning to biomedicine for symptom relief and Chinese medicine to address the root cause. They were also concerned about prolonged medication use, particularly antibiotics, and discontinued prescribed treatments based on their own judgment.;These motivations highlight caregivers’ broader interest in holistic, personalized, and potentially less invasive healthcare options for children with RRTIs. This understanding is crucial for the healthcare providers in fostering effective communication, tailoring treatments, respecting cultural beliefs, and advancing research in pediatric care.;"children; recurrent respiratory tract infections; medical pluralism; pediatric Tuina; healthcare seeking patterns"

Its anti-inflammatory properties reduce pro-inflammatory cytokines and preserve the integrity of the blood-brain barrier, generating interest in exploring its effects on the central nervous system. Zebrafish (Danio rerio), a widely used animal model in neuropharmacological research, allows for the precise and reproducible evaluation of these effects. This study aimed to evaluate the anxiolytic and antidepressant-like effects of the aqueous extract of pomegranate fruit (Punica granatum) in adult zebrafish.;"The study was approved by the Ethics Committee on Animal Use (CEUA-UECE #04009489/2023), and registered in the National System for the Management of Genetic Heritage (SisGen #A4A0900). Zebrafish were allocated to groups (n = 8/group) and treated orally (p.o.; 20 ?L) with the aqueous extract of pomegranate fruit (100% - 1 g/mL or 50% - 0.5 g/mL), or distilled water (control group). An additional naïve (untreated) group (n = 8) was included for comparison. Behavioral tests were conducted 1 h after treatment. Initially, locomotor activity was assessed using the open field test. The animals were placed in Petri dishes divided into quadrants, and the number of times they crossed from one quadrant to another was recorded for 5 min. To assess anxiety-like behavior, the animals were placed in a glass aquarium (30 × 15 × 20 cm) containing a light and a dark zone. The time (s) that the zebrafish spent in the clear zone over a 5 min period was recorded. For the evaluation of depressive-like behavior, the fish were immersed in 1% ethanol for 30 min and then suspended vertically, with the caudal half of their bodies immobilized. The mobility time (s) was recorded over a 5 min period.";"Pretreatment with the extract did not affect the locomotor activity of the animals but increased the time the zebrafish spent in the clear zone of the aquarium (p < 0.0001 vs. control and naïve) and enhanced mobility time (p < 0.01 vs. control - 50% extract and p < 0.001 vs. control -100% extract). The results show that pomegranate extract induces anxiolytic and antidepressant-like behaviors in adult zebrafish without affecting locomotion, highlighting its potential as a natural therapy for psychiatric disorders. These effects may modulate neural circuits involved in emotional regulation via antioxidant and anti-inflammatory actions. The zebrafish model, with conserved neurochemical pathways, offers translational value. Effects may involve serotonergic and GABAergic systems implicated in anxiety and depression.
";These findings open new avenues for the development of effective and safe phytotherapeutics, reinforcing pomegranate as a promising source of neuroprotection. The aqueous extract of pomegranate fruit (Punica granatum) demonstrated anxiolytic and antidepressant-like effects in adult zebrafish, highlighting its neuroprotective effect.;"Pomegranate; Punica granatum; Anxiety; Antidepressant; Adult zebrafish"

However, studies focusing on the application, use patterns and therapeutic advantages of TCM are limited, leading to an unclear understanding of its role in managing acute infectious diseases. This research aims to explore public perceptions and expectations regarding the role of TCM in the prevention and treatment of acute infectious diseases through semi-structured interviews, and to clarify the positioning of TCM and provide theoretical and practical insights for its more effective application in disease control.;A purposive sampling method was used and interviewees were recruited until data saturation. Semi-structured interviews were conducted and transcripts were organized and analyzed using NVivo software. A thematic analysis approach was adopted for coding and categorization.;"Finally, 25 participants, including patients with acute infectious diseases and their family members (aged 19–56 years; 7 males and 18 females) were involved. A total of 82950 words were transcribed and preliminary analysis identified 67 codes, which were grouped into 26 themes and further refined into four domains: (1) The primary role of TCM in prevention: This includes six themes such as dietary therapy, Chinese patent medicines, and Chinese herbal decoction, reflecting a general public consensus on the dominant role of TCM in preventing acute infectious diseases. (2) The stage-specific role of TCM in treatment: Seven themes such as primary choice in mild cases, adjunctive role in severe cases, and recovery facilitation emerged under this category, indicating that the public tends to prefer TCM interventions (e.g., Chinese patent medicines, Chinese herbal decoctions, and dietary therapies) in the early, mild stage of illness. In cases of severe symptoms (e.g., persistent high fever or serious complications), a treatment model dominated by modern medicine and supplemented by TCM is preferred. During the recovery phase, TCM becomes the primary choice for promoting rehabilitation. TCM has shown particular efficacy in managing symptoms such as low-grade fever, cough, fatigue, and muscle soreness. Additionally, traditional techniques such as cupping, acupuncture, tuina-massage, and herbal plaster therapy are used for symptom relief. (3) Cognitive barriers affecting confidence in TCM use: This category comprises seven themes, including conceptual confusion, lack of knowledge, and difficulties in pattern differentiation and medication use. These barriers partly undermine public confidence in the efficacy of TCM in disease prevention and treatment. (4) Public expectations for TCM in disease prevention and treatment: Six themes fall under this category, including science popularization, clinical research, and policy support, indicating that the public expects stronger efforts in TCM education and research, improved accessibility and affordability.";TCM plays a dominant role in the prevention of acute infectious diseases and assumes a complementary role alongside modern medicine during treatment, depending on the stage of illness. To enhance public trust and utilization of TCM, efforts should focus on advancing clinical research, improving targeted health education, and promoting integrative development with modern medicine.;"Traditional Chinese Medicine; acute infectious disease; qualitative in-depth interview"

Convenience sampling was applied among people with experiences of TCM treatment for infectious diseases.;"By May, 2025, 639 valid questionnaires were collected (response rate?98.92% ). Female respondents accounted for 66.67% and 305 respondents (47.73%) possessed a medical background (all majors or occupation related to medicine, such as clinicians, nurses, medical researchers, healthcare policy makers and medical students). 
For respiratory diseases, 336 respondents (52.58%) had used TCM for prevention and 396 (61.97%) for treatment, primarily targeting influenza (64.79%) and COVID-19 (48.67%). For gastrointestinal diseases, 233 respondents (36.46%) used TCM for prevention and 249 (38.97%) for treatment, mainly addressing Norovirus infections (13.15%). Concurrently, the majority of respondents indicated a preference for TCM methods as their first choice for preventing (76.37%)/treating (73.55%) infectious diseases, and 430 respondents (67.29%) primarily used Chinese medicinal formulas or Chinese patent medicines, while 515 respondents (80.59%) regularly stock TCM products at home.
Regarding ""the most significant roles of TCM "" 388 respondents (60.72%) rated ""prevention of infectious diseases"" as the priority, followed by ""symptom alleviation"" (20.03%), "" rehabilitation""  (12.51%) and ""acute phase control"" (5.63%).

The inclusion of TCIM in medical education is crucial for expanding access, ensuring safety and achieving the full integration of these modalities into healthcare, in order to address worldwide public health challenges and uphold the right to therapeutic plurality.

In Brazil, modalities such as acupuncture, phytotherapy, Reiki, and yoga, among others, are offered by the Unified Health System (SUS) in 86% of municipalities. However, only 21% of medical schools in the country incorporate TCIM content into their curricula, highlighting possible gaps in the education of future physicians.

Educational strategies based on Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) have shown potential to enhance teaching and expand access to knowledge in various fields. Thus, this research aims to propose and evaluate a open-access educational application on TCIM as a support tool in the teaching-learning process of TCIM for medical students and faculty in Brazil.

To the best of our knowledge, the application we developed, MedPICS, is the first Brazilian mobile learning application on TCIM, created as a result of academic research.

In Brazil, an estimated 704,000 new cases are expected annually for the 2023-2025 period. In response, the National Cancer Control Policy and Integrative and Complementary Practices (PICS) are fundamental for comprehensive care.

Integrative Oncology, a patient-centered and evidence-based approach, utilizes PICS to complement conventional treatment. It aims to manage psycho-emotional symptoms and adverse effects such as fatigue, nausea, and pain, understanding the disease within its social and emotional context.

In synergy with the perspective of PICS in Oncology, this study proposes to investigate the dimension of comprehensive care through BioFAO Medicine. Its main objectives are to describe the responses to the use of BioFAO Medicine as PICS in Oncology, identify its relationship with the meanings of comprehensive care, and explore the impact of this treatment on the well-being and quality of life of cancer patients.";"This is a qualitative and exploratory study, using semi-structured interviews with 8 physicians trained in BioFAO Medicine and 10 patients diagnosed with cancer who have been undergoing treatment for at least one year.
Data collection was conducted at the BioFAO Institute's Social Outpatient Clinic and in medical offices in Rio de Janeiro. The discourse analysis was based on Bardin's (2011) thematic content analysis.";"The preliminary analysis of interviews with physicians who practice BioFAO Medicine reveals the following perceptions:
Medical Rationality: A distinct medical rationality approach that is complementarily integrated with conventional treatments and other Health Integrative Practices.
Therapeutic Integration: Identification of potentials and challenges in integrating the BioFAO method with other therapies, emphasizing the need for interprofessional collaboration.
Improvement in Quality of Life: Clinical observations indicating a perceived improvement in patients' quality of life, focusing on physical and mental well-being aspects.
Clinical Evolution: Reports of cases suggesting positive impacts on patients' clinical progression and quality of life
";Based on the interviews conducted, both doctors and patients shared valuable insights. Healthcare professionals emphasized that the BioFAO Medicine approach promotes more comprehensive care, enhancing the emotional, mental, and physical well-being of the patient alongside conventional treatment. Patients, on the other hand, reported feeling more confident about their physical health, noticed a reduction in the side effects of traditional treatments, and experienced an improvement in their quality of life by incorporating a method that stimulates the self-organization of the Biocampo. These experiences reinforce the importance of a holistic view in oncological care, where treatment goes beyond the disease and also considers the emotional and energetic aspects of the individual. The reports suggest that resources like BioFAO can accelerate recovery, increase patient autonomy, and strengthen the relationship between patients and healthcare professionals. Thus, the project demonstrates that integrating complementary approaches into oncological treatment is essential to providing more humane, complete, and effective care, aligned with the principles of integrative oncology.;"Complementary Therapies; Homeopathy; Treatment Outcome; Integrative Oncology"

Gut microbiota-derived postbiotics, including Nisin (N) and Urolithin B (UB), are emerging as novel candidates for cancer therapeutics. Nisin, a bacteriocin produced by Lactococcus lactis, has demonstrated antimicrobial and anticancer activities. Urolithin B, a gut microbial metabolite derived from ellagitannins, exhibits anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antiproliferative properties. This study aimed to evaluate N and UB's antiproliferative and synergistic effects on human lymphoma cells and to investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms using proteomics.;The antiproliferative effects of N, UB, and their combinations were assessed in the HKB-11 human lymphoma cell line using the Alamar Blue assay. Drug synergy was quantified by the Combination Index (CI) method. Mechanistic insights were explored through reactive oxygen species (ROS) measurement, apoptosis quantification via flow cytometry, and bottom-up proteomic profiling of mono- and co-treated cells.;N and UB exhibited antiproliferative activity with IC50 values of 1467 µM and 87.56 µM, respectively. Their combination at a 4:6 ratio showed strong synergism (CI = 0.09 at IC95), significantly enhancing apoptosis (p < 0.0001) and modulating intracellular ROS. Proteomics analysis revealed critical protein alterations affecting mitochondrial function, lipid metabolism, cell cycle, and apoptosis. Notable changes included upregulation of COX6C (Log2FC = 2.07) and downregulation of CDK4 (Log2FC = -1.26), indicating involvement in mitochondrial respiration and G1-S phase arrest, respectively. These findings suggest that the combined treatment modulates multiple cancer-related pathways.;The synergistic effects of Nisin and Urolithin B demonstrate the therapeutic promise of postbiotics in lymphoma treatment.

The treatment of chronic pain should be multimodal according to guidelines and the biopsychosocial model. Non-pharmacological treatments of complementary and integrative medicine as well as art therapy have few side effects and can be a valuable addition. The effects of integrated treatments are underrepresented in high-quality university research. In November 2024, Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin a ward for interdisciplinary multimodal pain therapy (IMST). This ward is managed by orthopaedics and anaesthesiology. The multimodal treatment concept includes manual and osteopathic medicine, acupuncture, aromatherapy, movement therapy, breathing therapy, Qi Gong, mindfulness exercises, nutritional counseling and art therapy. It is our aim to conduct ongoing scientific research into the characterization of IMST patients, their treatment successes and our multimodal therapy.;We are conducting a prospective register study (evidence level IIb) on the IMST. The endpoints include the subjectively perceived pain intensity within the last 7 days, measured using a numerical rating scale (NRS, 0-10), the achievement of subjective treatment goals (in 10% increments) and satisfaction with the personal treatment success (0 = dissatisfied, 5 = very satisfied) from the patient's perspective. The data was collected using paper questionnaires and implemented in REDCap (version 14.5.43). The data was analyzed descriptively using SPSS version 30.;"Between November 4, 2024 and December 20, 2024, 14 predominantly geriatric and multimorbid patients were included in the study. The treatment concerns from the patient's perspective were predominantly musculoskeletal pain. Pain intensity was reduced by 35% from start to end of therapy to a median (Q1;Q3) of 5/10 (4;5). A 50% reduction in pain was achieved in 5 out of 14 participants. The patients' primary treatment goals were a reduction in pain, an improvement in sleep quality and learning coping strategies. The goals were achieved by 50% (median). The median satisfaction rating (Q1;Q3) was 4.5 (4;5).";Immediately after opening the inpatient IMST, we saw predominantly geriatric patients with predominantly musculoskeletal pain who achieved a clinically relevant reduction in pain and were very satisfied with the success of the treatment. By October 2025, we expect data on the characterization of patients and the treatment success of around 80 patients, which will be reported together with lessons learned.;"MULTIMODAL TREATMENT; Chronic Pain; hospital"

Hericium erinaceus (Lion's Mane mushroom), a culinary and medicinal fungus traditionally used in Chinese Medicine, has shown promising neuroregenerative, anxiolytic, and antidepressant effects. This study aims to assess its clinical applicability within an integrative health model, emphasizing the gut-brain axis, neuroplasticity, and inflammatory modulation.;This ongoing integrative literature review follows PRISMA guidelines and searches the PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases. Inclusion criteria cover preclinical and clinical studies published between 2015 and 2025 that explore neuroprotective, cognitive, and psychotropic effects of Hericium erinaceus. Keywords used include 'Hericium erinaceus', 'Lion's Mane', 'neurogenesis', 'depression', 'anxiety', 'gut-brain axis', and 'inflammation'. Risk of bias and methodological quality were assessed using CASP and SYRCLE tools.;Preliminary analysis of 38 selected studies indicates consistent evidence that H. erinaceus stimulates nerve growth factor (NGF) synthesis, enhances hippocampal neurogenesis, and modulates the microbiota–gut–brain axis. Clinical trials have reported reduced depressive symptoms, improved cognitive performance, and better sleep quality. Anti-inflammatory effects and upregulation of BDNF expression were also observed in both animal models and human participants. Findings support the potential of Hericium erinaceus as a neurofunctional agent within integrative medicine. Its unique bioactive compounds—hericenones and erinacines—promote neural regeneration and psychological resilience, particularly in anxiety-depression syndromes. This research emphasizes the importance of bridging ethnopharmacology and neuroscience in developing holistic, safe, and accessible therapeutic approaches.;Hericium erinaceus emerges as a promising adjunct in mental health treatment within TCIM, fostering neuroplasticity, emotional regulation, and gut-brain axis balance. Further controlled studies and translational health initiatives are warranted to confirm and expand its clinical use.;"Hericium erinaceus emerges as a promising adjunct in mental health treatment within TCIM; fostering neuroplasticity; Emotional Regulation; and gut-brain axis balance Further controlled studies and translational health initiatives are warranted to confirm and expand its clinical use"

Our objective was to describe in a sample of Brazilian T21 children attended by a pediatrician or nutritionist with expertise in T21 the frequency of alterations in some blood (aluminum, immunoglobulins for food allergy and celiac disease) and fecal (calprotectin) tests requested by the expert for the initial and/or follow-up consultation. Moreover, we also describe occurrence of food allergies and celiac disease as well as adoption of some lifestyle habits (gluten- and/or dairy-free diet, avoidance of aluminum cookware).;This longitudinal cross-sectional study was approved by the Ethics Committee on Human Research from the State University of Londrina (3.637.165/2019) and data was collected from January 2020 to January 2022. Families with a T21 member under 18 years-old answered a survey on health issues, use of nutritional supplements and lifestyle habits. They also shared the results of laboratorial exams collected for the first (n=102 participants) as well as follow-up (n=73 participants) consultation with the expert.;Use of probiotics, adoption of gluten and/or dairy-free diets and avoidance of aluminum-containing cookware or food package were reported by some families before the initial consultation, but the frequency increased at the follow-up. Among the participants with increased fecal calprotectin (n=13) or blood aluminum (n=10) levels at the initial consultation, there was a significant decrease in the follow-up (Student’s paired t test, p<0.05). Milk and egg allergies were reported by 14% and 7.4% of the participants. Celiac disease was reported by 2% of the participants and 1 participant was positive for anti-gliadin IgA.;The present study sheds light on the importance of monitoring fecal calprotectin and seric aluminum in T21 children as well as on the intervention to improve the general health of these persons.;"Down syndrome; laboratory tests; diet; trissomy 21"

The concept of “Brain Health”, now pivotal in defining overall wellness, urges the development of broad-spectrum, efficacious, and easily disseminated approaches to alleviate chronic stress and allostatic load and enhance the overall mental and physical well-being across lifespan.The Brain Health movement champions the identification of modifiable risk and resilience factors across neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative periods, aiming to foster preventative interventions tailored to both at-risk individuals and the wider population. Mind-body interventions target the brain and body physiology associated with stress and allostasis, prioritizing lifestyle factors that reduce stress and improve brain health. This reflects a paradigm shift towards personalized, whole-person lifespan strategies that has gained traction within multiple stakeholder organizations.
";Dr. Lavretsky will describe the nuanced interactions among lifestyle, emotional states, and mental health in aging populations and how mind-body practices can facilitate brain health and overall wellness across the lifespan in psychiatric populations. Her presentation will describe several yoga and Tai Chi clinical trials in aging adults that will demonstrate beneficial effects on brain health and biomarkers of stress and aging that can be a useful strategy for prevention and treatment of late life neuropsychiatric disorders. We previously demonstrated that yoga improved depression, resilience, memory and executive functions, increased hippocampal choline concentrations, and modulated brain connectivity in older adults with mild cognitive impairment, while Tai Chi can be helpful for treatment of depression and improved psychological resilience. ;In the recent study (NCT03503669), we investigated the effects of Kundalini Yoga (KY) versus memory training (MET)on brain gray matter volume (GMV) changes in older women with cerebrovascular risk factors and subjective memory complaints. Compared to KY, MET showed reductions in GMV in left prefrontal, pre- and post-central, supramarginal, superior temporal and pericalcarine cortices, right paracentral, postcentral, superior and inferior parietal cortices, the banks of the superior temporal sulcus, and the pars opercularis. Right hippocampal volume increased after yoga intervention. At 24-weeks follow-up, KY yielded a significant, large effect size improvement in subjective cognitive impairment measures compared to MET. On a transcriptional level, at 12- and 24-week follow-up, KY uniquely altered aging-associated signatures, including interferon gamma and other psycho-neuro-immune pathways. Levels of chemokine eotaxin-1, an aging marker, increased over time in MET but not KY participants. In another recent study of Tai Chi versus Health Education (HEW), TCC was superior to HEW in improving general health, and increased brain connectivity in the Default Mode network that correlated with improvements in depression and resilience (NCT02460666) that illustrates the brain and whole person health benefits of mind-body therapies.;"These results suggest clinical and biological benefits to yoga and Tai Chi, linking changes to neuroprotective, neuroplastic and anti-inflammatory effects of mind-body therapies that can be used for treatment and prevention of neuropsychiatric disorders in aging adults.

Heritage physical activities are defined in this context as those with regional, cultural, and/or traditional relevance and may include dances, sports and games, martial arts, and other movement practices. Some of these activities are well integrated in traditional, complementary, and integrative medicine globally (e.g., yoga, tai chi, qi gong). Many others (e.g., ethnic dances) are well known in communities to be of deep value for the health and wellbeing of self, family, community, spirit, and land, but are often not well integrated into health efforts. Synthesizing literature relevant to heritage physical activity can help to guide future work in this area from a global health promotion perspective, including integration into clinical practices and lifestyle medicine goals. The Public Health Resonance Project is a global effort to synthesize this evidence base to produce actionable evidence that can be used by individuals, advocates, systems, and communities to improve health outcomes and health equity locally and globally. ;This presentation will describe the Public Health Resonance Project’s current protocol and plans for the synthesis from the global evidence base that will (i) describe the extent and nature of the literature supporting these practices, (ii) assess evidence gaps, (iii) apply a typology by population, location, and other variables, (iv) produce practical meta-data to be used to create an applied, accessible database.;The evidence synthesis is currently in the protocol feedback stage. In this phase, numerous scholarly traditions and search terms have been identified and refined following input from the study team, a global team of experts, and library science expertise. Input is now being gathered from practitioners, scholars, clinicians, and other communities who would use this evidence synthesis. Following standardized protocols, presentation attendees will be invited to give input on (a) search terms and (b) relevant scholarly traditions. In the next phase, PubMed, EBSCOhost, Web of Science, PsycInfo, AnthroSource, SocIndex, ATLA Religion Database, Sports Medicine & Education Index, and SPORTDiscus will be searched for peer-reviewed, published literature related to one or more heritage physical activities. Using Covidence to manage the review, article titles and abstracts will be screened to determine relevance. Full-text screening and data extraction will then be completed including plans to enable continuous monitoring of intercoder reliability. An extraction template and guide have been developed and piloted to support this large-scale data integration. These have included iterative updates and refinements based on feedback from the research team and expert steering committee. Primary products of this work will include meta-data to support the planned global Heritage Physical Activity Database as well as a peer-reviewed journal articles following PRISMA for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines. ;Heritage physical activity is a promising area for health promotion and health system inclusion. Supporting activities of known importance and value in communities can improve individual health, reduce health risk, and increase collective well-being across many dimensions.

Background: Manual and manipulative therapy interventions are commonly sought by individuals experiencing headaches or migraines. Evidence supports the use of manual
therapy as part of the management of headache and migraine disorders. Osteopaths are health professionals who provide care for individuals experiencing headaches and migraines. However, there is a lack of data concerning the profile of osteopaths treating these conditions, in addition to their diagnostic and management strategies.";Methods: The Osteopathy Research Connect-New Zealand (ORC-NZ), a practice-based research network for the New Zealand osteopathy profession, was established, and recruitment occurred between August to December 2018.;Results: Two hundred and seventy-seven respondents provided responses to the headache and migraine items on the ORC-NZ practice questionnaire. Of these respondents, 235(84.8%) indicated treating headaches often, and 107 (38.6 %) indicated treating migraines often. Osteopaths who reported often treating patients with migraines and headaches were more likely to report clinically supervising associates and be collocated with a general practitioner. In terms of management, they tend to use HVLA (High Velocity Low Amplitude) techniques, are likely to treat TMJ ( temporomandibular joint) in the case of migraines, and the thoracic spine for patients with headaches. Further, NZ osteopaths frequently refer patients with migraines and/or headaches to other practitioners.;"NZ osteopaths treat patients with migraines and/or headaches and frequently refer them to other practitioners.

Menopause and the climacteric transition are characterized by hypoestrogenism and a variety of vasomotor, somatic and psychological symptoms that impair quality of life. Although hormone replacement therapy (HRT) remains the standard treatment in allopathic medicine, many women seek alternative therapies due to contraindications or personal preferences. Morus nigra L. (black mulberry) has a long history of ethnomedicinal use for alleviating climacteric symptoms in Brazil, owing to its affordability, accessibility and purported polyphenolic activity.

Objective:
To systematically review the literature on the therapeutic efficacy, safety and chemical properties of Morus nigra in the management of climacteric and menopausal symptoms.
";"A comprehensive search was conducted through PubMed, SciELO, BVS-Virtual Health Library, Cochrane Library and Embase, supplemented by manual searches in theses and dissertations. The PICO framework guided the strategy: P, perimenopausal women; I, M. nigra interventions; C, HRT or placebo; O, effects on climacteric symptoms. Search terms included “Morus nigra” (and synonyms) combined with “menopause” or “climacteric.” Articles in English, Portuguese or Spanish, with no time restrictions, were eligible. Data were extracted and synthesized by thematic categorization: mode of consumption, clinical outcomes, adverse effects and phytochemical profiles. Screening proceeded in duplicate, with resolution of discrepancies by consensus.
";"Of 76 records identified, 14 were duplicates and 58 were excluded on title/abstract review. Four studies met inclusion criteria: one cross-sectional survey (25 %), one randomized controlled trial (25 %), one clinical cohort (25 %) and one ethnobotanical laboratory study (25 %).

Consumption Patterns: All clinical investigations (75 %) evaluated M. nigra leaf preparations as tea, attributed to low cost and cultural prevalence.

Clinical Efficacy: In the RCT, daily M. nigra leaf powder for 60 days significantly reduced vasomotor symptoms (hot flashes, p < 0.01) and somatic complaints (insomnia, fatigue; p < 0.05) versus placebo, with effect sizes comparable to low-dose HRT. The clinical cohort study corroborated improvements in sleep, mood, memory, functional capacity, mental health and pain (p < 0.05). 

Safety Profile: Adverse events were mild and infrequent: increased diuresis, flatulence and appetite (10 %). The RCT noted modest elevations in fasting glucose (? + 8 mg/dL, p < 0.05) and free thyroxine (? + 0.4 ng/dL, p < 0.02) and estradiol (? + 35 ng/dL, p < 0.02), warranting monitoring.

Phytochemistry: Laboratory analyses demonstrated significant antioxidant activity at 10 mg/mL and moderate antiglycation potential. Polyphenolic compounds, chiefly flavonoids, were implicated in symptom relief.
";Current evidence suggests that Morus nigra leaf preparations may offer a safe, culturally acceptable adjunct or alternative to HRT for climacteric symptoms, particularly vasomotor and somatic complaints. However, findings are limited by small sample sizes, heterogeneity of interventions and short follow-up. Rigorous, large-scale randomized trials with standardized extracts and long-term safety assessments are essential to substantiate clinical recommendations and elucidate mechanisms of action.;"Morus; Perimenopause; Complementary Therapies; Gynecology; Systematic Review"

This often leads to frustration and distress in both parents and healthcare professionals. Within a multicenter randomized controlled trial (RCT) on lavender oil chest wraps (LCWs) for infants hospitalized with bronchiolitis, we explored nurses’ views and experiences with LCWs as a complementary approach to standard conventional care, with the objective of understanding the impact of LCWs on patients, their parents and nursing practice. ;Semi-structured interviews were conducted with pediatric nurses from two Swiss hospitals involved in a clinical trial on LCWs for bronchiolitis. Interview transcripts were analyzed using a qualitative descriptive approach, aimed at providing a rich summary of participants ideas, experiences and opinions. ;"Results: 18 nurses were interviewed. In view of the lack of effective pharmacological treatment and the frequent feeling of “doing nothing”, LCWs emerged as a valuable complementary care strategy for both parents and nurses. Nurses observed calming and anxiolytic effects of LCWs, as well as reduced coughing and discomfort and improved breathing and sleeping in affected infants. Nurses also described soothing and reassuring effects of LCWs on parents, which improved the therapeutic relationship. Confidence in LCWs' effects tended to be higher in nurses with greater familiarity and experience with integrative care practices. Furthermore, nurses experienced a new quality of care associated with the implementation of LCWs and highlighted LCWs’ value beyond symptom relief as part of a more holistic, patient-centered and relational approach. Regarding the routine integration of LCWs in hospital settings, nurses identified time constraints, organizational issues and specific training needs as important factors.
Discussion: This study suggests that LCWs may enhance the effects of minimal handling in bronchiolitis care, supporting an integrative approach to complementary and conventional care in hospital settings. Our findings also highlight that implementing traditional, complementary and integrative medicine (TCIM) approaches implies not only the introduction of new procedures, but also the fostering of a holistic approach to care. These results can inform future implementation strategies for TCIM. Methodologically, our findings demonstrate the value of qualitative research in the context of RCTs, offering context-specific insights that may aid in interpreting clinical outcomes.";The integration of complementary therapies such as LCWs into routine care may offer benefits beyond symptom relief. Qualitative research alongside RCTs of new therapies should be encouraged to provide a more comprehensive understanding of their impact on patients, caregivers and healthcare professionals, while also providing valuable insights into the implementation of TCIM interventions in real-world settings.;"Bronchiolitis; complementary medicine; integrative nursing; lavender chest wraps"

In Western contexts, mindfulness has been conceptualized as a secular program comprising a set of practices—including breathing exercises, meditation and yoga—designed to enhance attentional self-regulation and foster attitudes such as openness, curiosity, and acceptance. Empirical evidence suggests that regular mindfulness practice improves emotional regulation and overall psychological well-being.

A diagnosis of a life-threatening illness, such as cancer, often followed by invasive procedures and treatments associated with a range of physical and psychosocial symptoms—including pain, fatigue, and anxiety—frequently leads to a substantial decline in quality of life. Mindfulness training has been shown to help with the management of symptoms related to chronic health conditions, supporting reductions in perceived stress, mood disturbances, anxiety and depressive symptoms, while promoting emotional regulation skills.

The Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction program  (MBSR), developed by Jon Kabat-Zinn in the United States in 1979, was the first structured intervention based on mindfulness principles. Its initial objective was to help individuals suffering from chronic pain by cultivating more adaptive coping strategies. Since then, the program has undergone cultural and contextual adaptations, including the Mindfulness-Based Health Promotion (MBHP), tailored for Latin American populations and protocols designed for individuals with cancer. Such adaptations are essential to accommodate cultural differences and the unique challenges of specific populations, ensuring the program’s relevance and effectiveness across diverse contexts.
The objective of this study was to apply the Delphi method to evaluate proposed adaptations of the MBHP program for oncology patients, in order to ensure its clinical applicability.";"A Delphi panel was conducted with 19 experts (including physicians, psychologists, nurses and researchers) with experience in mindfulness and/or oncology. The aim was to reach a consensus evaluation of 10 proposed adaptations to the MBHP program, which were developed based on the researcher’s prior experience with pilot groups. Experts completed an online questionnaire using a 5-point Likert scale. Consensus was defined as ?70% agreement, calculated by combining the responses ""Agree"" and ""Strongly Agree.""";"Results
The response rate was 89.47% (17/19). All 10 proposed adaptations reached consensus, with five receiving ?70% agreement at the “Strongly Agree” level, and five meeting the consensus threshold when combining the “Agree” and “Strongly Agree” responses.

Discussion
The study confirmed the feasibility and acceptability of the proposed adaptations to the MBHP program for oncology patients, providing support for its implementation and for future evaluations of its clinical impact. The main limitations of the study include the small sample size of experts and the absence of a second Delphi round, as consensus was achieved for all proposals in the first round. The research will proceed to a second phase, which involves offering the adapted MBHP program to online groups of oncology patients. This study was approved by a Research Ethics Committee (CAAE: 76610623.0.0000.5505).";The findings indicate that all proposed adaptations to the MBHP program for oncology patients were validated by experts, ensuring greater confidence in its implementation.;"cancer; Mindfulness Based Interventions; Delphi Method; Attention Training; health promotion"

These practices have the potential to improve care quality, reduce medicalization, and promote user well-being, particularly in mental health contexts and the management of chronic conditions.

Although officially regulated within SUS since 2006, the incorporation of ICHP into Primary Health Care (PHC) remains limited, constrained by gaps in professional training, cultural resistance, and structural barriers. Therefore, analyzing concrete experiences of implementation becomes essential to support their consolidation and expansion. In this regard, Primary Health Care Unit 1 of Cruzeiro Novo (UBS 1 CRZ), in the Federal District of Brazil, provides a unique setting for study, given its innovative integration of ICHP into routine care.

This study aimed to analyze the adherence and perceptions of health professionals regarding the implementation of ICHP at UBS 1 CRZ, between March 2023 and May 2024.";"A qualitative, descriptive, and exploratory study was carried out using a single case study design. Data collection included literature review, participant observation, and semi-structured interviews with 20 health professionals, comprising physicians, nurses, nursing technicians, physiotherapists, psychologists, pharmacists, nutritionists, social workers, and community health agents. Inclusion criteria required at least one year of experience at the unit.

Participant observation captured daily dynamics and professional interactions, while interviews provided insights into perceptions and experiences with ICHP. Data were analyzed through Bardin’s content analysis (2011), encompassing pre-analysis, material exploration, and interpretation. Methodological triangulation was adopted to strengthen the validity of findings.";"The findings revealed that, despite initial challenges such as resistance among part of the staff and infrastructure limitations, adherence to ICHP was progressively consolidated, broadening therapeutic possibilities. User feedback emphasized concrete benefits, including reduced anxiety, improved mood, relief from musculoskeletal pain, and better sleep quality.

Two singular contributions emerged as central outcomes: the role of continuous professional training, which enhanced confidence and competence in offering ICHP, and the development of an interactive digital application, designed to support prescription, follow-up, and dissemination of ICHP. These elements underscore the innovative dimension of the study and its potential relevance for other PHC contexts.";The study demonstrated that the implementation of ICHP in PHC, when supported by professional training and technological resources, strengthens comprehensive care and fosters humanization within SUS. The experience at UBS 1 CRZ shows that ICHP not only improve users’ health and well-being but also strengthen bonds between professionals and patients, promoting a more collaborative care environment. Similar initiatives should be encouraged in other SUS units, consolidating ICHP as a sustainable public health policy.;"Integrative and complementary health practices; Primary Health Care; Health Implementation; Health Professionals"

Current guideline recommendations highlight the growing importance of non-pharmacologic therapies such as acupuncture. This pilot study aims to investigate the effect of acupuncture on pain relief after STT surgery of the extremities.;This prospective single-arm, single-centre study included 25 patients who underwent surgical treatment of STTs of the extremities. Acupuncture was performed on the first postoperative day (POD), the pain intensity was assessed at different time points via numeric rating scale (NRS). Acupuncture was to be repeated on the third POD if the pain at rest was ? 3 / 10 on NRS. The function of the affected limb and quality of life before and after surgery were assessed using validated questionnaires.;"Twenty-five patients (mean age 60,7 years) were included. Most tumors were malignant, located in the lower extremities, with a mean size of 8.5 cm (3-18). Mean surgery time was 68.4 (± 35.6) minutes ; 72% underwent wide resection. Postoperative pain at rest was low (median NRS 1 (± 1) on POD 1, 0 (± 0,8)  thereafter). The lowest pain scores were observed on POD 2. Acupuncture was administered on POD 1 in all cases. Placement of acupuncture needles at the “optimal position” was feasible in 8 out of 25 patients; in the remaining cases, access was primarily impeded by surgical tapes and wound sites. Median hospital stay was four days. Global health scores remained stable; functional scores declined temporarily. Wound complications occurred in six patients; however, none were attributable to acupuncture. No other serious adverse events were observed.";Acupuncture was feasible, safe, and well accepted in the postoperative setting of STT resection. The primary impediment to acupuncture administration was the placement of wound dressings and the surgical wound itself. Pain levels and the need for opioid prescription remained low throughout the postoperative period. Further controlled studies are needed to evaluate the efficacy of acupuncture,  to optimize patient selection and acupuncture technique in patients with STTs of the extremities.;"acupuncture; postoperative pain; extremity function; soft tissue sarcoma; lipoma"

Adverse childhood experiences (ACE) are associated with health problems in adulthood, such as obesity (KEIRNS et al., 2023), diabetes (CHU et al., 2021), suicide (LEE et al., 2023), and heart disease (AKASAKI et al., 2021), as well as psychopathologies such as depression, anxiety, and social withdrawal (FELITTI, 2019; MCLAFFERTY et al., 2019). This ongoing study investigates acute and chronic stress in 2,000 children (of both sexes) aged 8 to 14 years from the public school system of Curitiba, using three methods: screening questionnaire, salivary cortisol curve and Bio-Well.";"To avoid biases, the questionnaires identify pathologies, psychopathologies, neurological diseases, and the use of medications that alter cortisol, such as corticosteroids (HENZEN et al., 2000; BUSBY et al., 2020). Neurological diseases, such as malformation of the adenohypophysis (LIU et al., 2023), and psychopathologies, such as ADHD, anxiety, and depression, which affect the HPA axis (HAVELKA et al., 2016; BERENS et al., 2023), are also considered. Children with these conditions will be excluded. The cortisol curve will be obtained by three salivary collections on the same day (morning: 8am-9am; afternoon: 4pm-5pm; night: 10pm-11pm), following the protocol: do not brush teeth before collection; be fasting; avoid physical activity; not be in the catamenial period; store in a ventilated place, not requiring refrigeration.

In Brazil, the National Policy for the Healthcare of Indigenous Peoples (PNASPI) established Differentiated Care (AD) to counteract this legacy by recognizing cultural specificities. However, the implementation of this policy is hindered by a lack of systematized data on traditional medicine specialists and their care technologies. In response, the project ""Indigenous Care Technologies: Participatory Mapping of Specialists in Indigenous Medicines in the State of Ceará – MAPÊMI"" was created to address this gap. Its main objective is to conduct a participatory mapping of these specialists to value ancestral knowledge and support the integration of these practices into the official health system (SASI-SUS).";The project's methodology is based on a participatory approach, with its first six-month phase focusing on three pillars: institutional formalization, material development, and the training of indigenous researchers. Key activities included obtaining ethical approval from the Research Ethics Committee (CEP), with final approval from CONEP pending, registering the project in SISGEN and with FUNAI, and developing a visual identity and research instruments. The core of this phase was the selection of 11 indigenous researchers through a public call and a five-day training course held in the Tremembé indigenous land. This training covered the foundations of participatory mapping, recording techniques, data management, and research ethics.;"The first phase successfully qualified the 11 indigenous fellows to conduct the research. The training course was a key outcome, fostering rich discussions where participants collectively constructed a holistic vision of ""indigenous health"" as an inseparable link between body, spirituality, and territory. They also differentiated the individual concept of ""well-being"" from the collective indigenous perspective of ""good living"" (bem-viver). The ethical dimension was a central point, establishing a commitment to sensitive listening and ensuring that traditional knowledge is not treated as a commodity.";In conclusion, the initial phase of the MAPÊMI project successfully established a solid foundation for the field mapping stage. The training course proved to be a key milestone for political and conceptual alignment, reinforcing the agency of indigenous researchers in the production of knowledge about their own healing practices. The project is a strategic action to give practical meaning to Differentiated Care and now awaits final ethical clearance to move forward with the documentation and valorization of the indigenous medicines of Ceará.;"Indigenous health; Differentiated Care; Participatory Mapping; ancestral knowledge; Intercultural Dialogue"

Even before the pandemic, this population already exhibited concerning levels of mental health issues. The additional stressors brought by the crisis—such as health-related uncertainty, social isolation, and the sudden shift to remote learning—further intensified symptoms of anxiety, stress, and sleep disturbances. With the return to in-person academic routines in 2022, students encountered a new period of adjustment, which, in turn, imposed fresh mental health challenges and negatively impacted sleep quality. While psychotropic medications remain a widely adopted approach for managing these symptoms, there is increasing interest in complementary and alternative therapeutic strategies. Among them, Complementary Therapies (CT) such as Auriculotherapy and Floral Therapy have been recognized for their potential benefits. This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of Auriculotherapy and Floral Therapy in reducing anxiety and improving sleep quality among undergraduate students at a public university in the interior of São Paulo, Brazil.;This randomized clinical trial was conducted over a four-week period and included three groups: one received Auriculotherapy (A), another was treated with Floral Therapy (FT), and the third served as a control group without any intervention. Participants were selected based on symptoms of anxiety and poor sleep, previously identified through validated instruments: the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). These tools were administered before and after the interventions. Data were compiled using Microsoft Excel and analyzed using statistical models. Qualitative variables were described through absolute and relative frequencies, while quantitative variables were examined using linear regression and modified Poisson regression with robust variance, applying Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE).;Out of 106 students initially enrolled, 64 completed all phases of the study and were included in the final analyses. Linear regression results showed significant reductions in PSQI scores for the FT group (-1.84, p = 0.0107) and the A group (-2.24, p = 0.0077), when compared to the control. Additionally, post-intervention analysis revealed further score reductions of -2.73 (p < 0.0001) and -2.50 (p = 0.0002) for FT and A, respectively. The modified Poisson regression also suggested a reduced likelihood of poor sleep in the FT group following treatment. For STAI-State scores, a deterioration was observed in both the A and control groups, while the FT group showed improvement. However, with regard to STAI-Trait scores, both FT and A groups experienced worsening results, implying limited impact of the interventions on more stable, long-term anxiety patterns.;"Overall, both CTs—Auriculotherapy and Floral Therapy—produced beneficial effects on sleep quality, with floral therapy showing the most consistent outcomes. Nonetheless, neither intervention demonstrated significant improvements in anxiety, highlighting the need for longer-term studies to assess their full therapeutic potential.

The research is based on a conceptual analysis of diverse bibliographic sources, ranging from traditional texts to recent scientific studies.;Historically, steaming has its roots in ancient practices in Mesoamerican and Asian cultures, where the use of herbal steam in the pelvic area was common in fertility and postpartum rituals. Today, the practice has been adopted as a means of promoting healing, treating conditions such as prolapse, and relieving menstrual symptoms. Although most of the evidence is anecdotal, there is growing interest in exploring its therapeutic effects, especially in relieving gynecological and emotional symptoms. The study also proposes a new terminology, “Pelvic Steam Therapy” (PVT), to include a broader range of beneficiaries, including men and people without uteruses.;The study concludes that, while reports of benefits are promising, there is a significant gap in the scientific literature regarding protocols and application guidelines. Therefore, it is essential that future studies systematically investigate the effects of DVT and elucidate its mechanisms of action to promote safe and informed adoption of this practice in integrative health routines.;"Pelvic; Steaming; Natural Gynecology; women's health"

The FloreSer Program is structured in twelve weekly face-to-face meetings to apply a multidisciplinary care protocol aimed at women with fibromyalgia, through educational activities, Integrative and Complementary Health Practices (ICHP) and Social Technologies (ST), with a focus on promoting autonomy and strengthening self-care.
In order to measure the functional capacity and health status of the participants, the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire - Revised Brazilian Portuguese version (FIQR-Br) was applied before and after the FloreSer Program.";"The sample consisted of 16 patients diagnosed with fibromyalgia, according to the criteria of the American College of Rheumatology, who were being medically monitored at the Chronic Pain Outpatient Clinic of a university hospital in southern Brazil. Participants who met the clinical criteria and voluntarily agreed to take part in the FloreSer Program were included and divided into two equal groups through stratified randomization. The study was approved by the institution's Human Research Ethics Committee, according to opinion number 63594322.9.0000.0105.
The self-administered instrument used was the FIQR-Br. The questionnaire consists of 21 items organized into three main domains: function, general impact and symptoms. All the questions refer to personal experiences over the last seven days and are answered using 11-point numerical scales (ranging from 0 to 10), with higher scores indicating worse health and biggest impact of fibromyalgia. The total score is obtained by adding up the scores of the three domains, applying specific weights for each domain, resulting in a final score that can vary from 0 to 100 points.
Two groups were analyzed: intervention and control, with the intervention group consisting of eight participants from the first edition, and the control group eight participants from the second edition of the program, both of whom were assessed using the FIQR-Br in the same period of time: one week before the start (T0) and in the closing week (T1) of the first edition of the program. After the data was collected, it was tabulated in a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet and the mean and median were calculated for each of the groups at T0 and T1.";"In the intervention group, at T0, a mean of 69.05 and a median of 69.65 were obtained, while at T1, the mean became 48.45 and the median 43.50, showing a 37.5% reduction in the median score after the program. This result suggests that program participants had considerably reduced levels of fibromyalgia impact.
In the control group, at T0, a mean of 61.61 and a median of 67.55 were obtained, while at T1, the mean was 57.54 and the median was 67.45, suggesting a minimal change in the median (0.2%) for the control group, which maintained standard treatment during this period.";Participants in the FloreSer Program experienced a reduction in the impact of fibromyalgia when comparing the initial and final stages and compared to the control group.;"Fibromyalgia; Health Status; Complementary Therapies"

Considering that blood pressure (BP) alterations are risky in pregnancy, and that reiki could be a low-risk and cost-free method, the aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of a remote reiki session (RRS) in lowering BP in hospitalized high-risk pregnant women (HRPW), as an acute response and as BP behaviour considering the day before, the day of the session and the day after the RRS. ;"HRPW, with a history of BP alterations, recently admitted to a hospital, were invited to participate and were randomly assigned to a control group (CG) or an intervention group (IG) according to the order of admission and type of BP alteration; blinded for the interview researchers. Measures of BP were collected and re-collected before RRS and one hour later. The CG did not change anything in their routine, and the IG received a RRS, started just after of the first collection data. A month later, a medical student consults the data history, collecting all BP information registered by nurses during the day of the study, as well as the day before and the day after it. Mixed-effects models were employed to assess differences in systolic and diastolic BP, including group, time, and their interaction as fixed effects, with random intercepts for subjects. The statistical significance of the fixed effects and the interaction term was assessed using joint Wald tests. Within-group changes for each period were further examined using paired Student’s t-tests for both intervention and groups. ";"Data from 22 HRPW were analysed (IG=12; CG=10). The mixed-effects analysis of both systolic and diastolic BP revealed no statistically significant effects of group assignment, time, or their interaction. For systolic BP, neither the main effect of group (?²(1)=0.01, p=0.9422), the effect of time across measurements (?²(2)=2.03, p=0.3620), nor the group-by-time interaction (?²(2)=0.03, p=0.9844) reached statistical significance. Similarly, for diastolic BP, none of the tested effects were significant: group (?²(1)=0.15, p = 0.6999), time (?²(2)=0.01, p=0.9966), or group-by-time interaction (?²(2)=0.51, p=0.7738), as indicated by Wald chi-square tests. Furthermore, paired t-tests within each group revealed no significant acute changes in either systolic (IG: mean change=1.1 mmHg, p=0.68; CG: 2.6 mmHg, p=0.49) or diastolic BP (IG: 3.9 mmHg, p=0.39; CG: -1.3 mmHg, p=0.72). This study is the first found that analysed RRS on BP with HRPW without significant results of a single RRS on BP3. Mostly previous studies showed positive significant effects on BP in healthy people with one, two, six and 21 presential reiki sessions as well as with three RRS4-9. However, two other studies with post-caesarean delivery women did not find any alterations in BP after one or two presential reiki session10,11. ";Results indicate that a single RRS in HRPW did not produce significant alterations in BP. However, this data must be analysed carefully due to the number of participants.

The Union of Red Propolis Producers of the State of Alagoas, as the requesting entity, registered the geographical indication of red propolis in 2012 with the National Institute of Industrial Property, under number IG 201101. This study explores the contributions of red propolis to global public health, and by examining data from the International Agency of Research on Cancer published in 2022, its possible to observe 19,976,499 new incidence cases, with the five most prevalent types being: lung, breast, colorectal, prostate, stomach and liver cancers. The mortality rate reached 9,743,832 cases, with emphasis on lung, colorectal, liver, breast and stomach cancers. In light of these complex clinical challenges, such as cancer, its crucial to systematize the existing scientific knowledge on the subject.;The objective of this review is to present and discuss recent scientific evidence on the effects of Brazilian red propolis in cancer treatment. A narrative literature review was conducted, with an exclusive search on the PubMed database using the descriptor “red propolis cancer”. The manual search was carried out in May 2025, considering publications between the years 2020 and 2025. Fourteen articles were identified, of which two were excluded for not addressing cancer or Brazilian propolis.;Of the twelve included articles, all presented in vitro studies, two of which used nanoparticles, and one also conducted in vivo tests with mice. Two studies addressed lung cancer cells: one demonstrated significant therapeutic effects, while the other did not show relevant results. One article investigated head and neck cancer stem cells, showing a reduction in their proportion. Promising results were observed in studies involving breast cancer cells (3), ovarian (3), liver (1), prostate (1), and melanoma (1). One study also demonstrated inhibition of colon cancer cells using a combination of red, brown and green propolis. Some articles reported enhanced efficacy of chemotherapy treatments when combined with red propolis. Its bioactive compounds also demonstrated properties that contribute to health promotion and education, as well as disease prevention, by strengthening the immune system and exhibiting antifungal, antimicrobial, antibacterial, antiparasitic, antiplasmodial, antitumor, antioxidant and immunomodulatory activities. These effects indicate potential therapeutic applications in inflammatory, infectious and oncological diseases.;The data reinforce the relevance of red propolis as a promising natural resource with potential to investigate possibilities in the treatment of various types of cancer. However, more controlled and randomized clinical trials in humans are still needed, along with deeper investigations into its mechanisms of action and potential therapeutic applications. This study contributes to the appreciation of Brazilian traditional medicine and its integration into innovative therapeutic strategies, applicable to different complex medical systems, for the benefit of global health.;"Propolis; Public Health Practice; phytotherapy; Apitherapy; Immune System"

Its integration into conventional medicine has been supported by the WHO, especially since the Traditional Medicine Strategy 2014-2023 (extended to 2025) and the Astana Declaration. In this context, the study explores the incorporation of acupuncture in conventional health centers, with emphasis on the experience of the Red de Salud UC CHRISTUS in Chile.;The research employed a descriptive review of scientific literature in PubMed and Scopus, as well as institutional web sources. It was complemented with data obtained from health professionals and patient surveys in the UC CHRISTUS Network, describing the integration process, its benefits and challenges.;"Results
Globally, the push for traditional medicine has been reflected in initiatives such as the WHO Global Center for Traditional Medicine and the inclusion of TCM in ICD-11. In the USA, the opioid crisis prompted the inclusion of acupuncture as a therapeutic alternative, with Medicare coverage from 2020. Europe also shows progress: in countries such as Norway and Denmark, a significant portion of hospitals offer acupuncture.
In Chile, acupuncture was regulated in 2006 and has since increased its presence, with more than 1800 registered practitioners in 2024 and FONASA coverage in certain pathologies. A new Complementary Medicine Policy was published in 2024 to fully integrate it into the national system.
Benefits of integration
For patients, integration improves access, promotes reliable therapeutic options and facilitates treatment continuity. Therapists gain access to institutional support and clinical safety. Institutions, in turn, improve patient satisfaction, reduce drug use and optimize cost-effectiveness.
Challenges identified
There are regulatory, financial and communication barriers. Some techniques such as moxibustion are limited in hospital settings. In addition, the need to use conventional medical language and share clinical records represents a challenge for acupuncturists. There are also financial constraints and lack of comprehensive coverage.
Discussion
Integration in health systems such as the United Kingdom or Norway has been successful. In Chile, the particular case of its implementation in the Red de Salud UC CHRISTUS is presented, with almost 300 outpatient attentions performed to date with excellent results in patient surveys and with a project to be implemented in the near future to attend hospitalized patients. The integrative approach not only improves patient well-being, but also collaboration between medical disciplines.
Limitations
The review was limited by the number of databases used, the lack of structured quality assessment of studies, and the absence of quantitative analysis.";Acupuncture can be an effective tool for strengthening integrative health systems. The experience at UC CHRISTUS reflects its potential, although challenges remain in access, economic evaluation, and communication that must be addressed to achieve sustainable integration.;"traditional medicine integration; healthcare integration; acupuncture"

There is a prevailing negative attitude towards fever, which persists despite the evidence of beneficial immunological effects and lack of practical implementation of this knowledge among both healthcare professionals and the lay public. It results in overuse of healthcare providers, medication as antibiotics and antipyretics as a burden for the healthcare sector. After it?`s implementation, the effectiveness of the FeverFriend Program was investigated in promoting behavioral change in fever management.;"The FeverFriend Program includes a decision aid with risk assesment based on a complex algorithm. This unique algorithm was based on the NICE quidelines adapted to local properties by an expert group, resulting in a standard RAG triage and behavioral advice. The App is connected to a knowledge base. Both are free available. 
A prospective, observational registry study was conducted within a mobile app with self-selected users. 
Patient`s and caregiver`s anonymized in-app data of a 42-month period (12/2020-05/2024) were analyzed. The FeverFriend app incorporates four different observational units. Users, patients level including baseline characteristics, fever measurement and result level, closing with illness review.";"Results: Among 21,137 Hungarian users following app use, the results indicated that all three hypotheses remained statistically significant (p > 0.01). Overall, our analysis (McNemar's test) provides robust evidence for the significant changes observed in the use of antibiotics, antipyretics and doctor visits due to fever, even after considering multiple testing adjustments. 
Discussion: Sociological research attributes parental attitudes to feverish pediatric illnesses to a number of factors such as unjustified fear, help-seeking behavior, complex behavioral patterns of symptom avoidance and comfort-seeking. In the light of recent research, the target points of improvement in attitudes are linked to healthcare literacy among health professionals and lay people. In our program self-reporting EMA, real time and real-life circumstances were captured. The good coverage of our data observed in key sociodemographic and anthropometric measures provides confidence in the validity of our findings and their applicability to the broader population of small children. 
After rigorous risk assessment, it has been found that most cases of childhood febrile illnesses can be managed with a delayed or no prescription strategy for antibiotics, resulting in satisfactory patient outcomes and uncomplicated clinical courses.";The FeverFriend Program, as a best practice example of evidence based integrative approaches is available in 9 languages worldwide. It proves to be a safe and effective tool for promoting behavior change in fever management among the nonrandomized population of caregivers of children. These findings contributed to a new Guideline on Management of Childhood Fever in Hungary released in March 2025, implementing the added value of integrative approaches into the existing healthcare system.;"integrative approach; fever management; overmedicalization; guideline adherence; personalized e-health"

The study draws on the principle of Kalunga, as presented by Fu-Kiau (2024). Kalunga is understood as the vital Force (Nguzo, Ntu, Axé) that not only constitutes human beings but also shapes the world in its entirety. Nature, animals, the sea, and the universe are all expressions of this force—each being a particle of Kalunga (Fu-Kiau, 2024). Terreiros, in turn, are understood as spaces of care, healing, and belonging, especially for Black youth who find in them a place for subjective reconstruction through ancestral physical and spiritual practices. This work is thus anchored in the cosmoperceptions present in African-based religions, which structure practices, ways of acting, and modes of relating to the world, in order to understand the objective effects of these terreiro-based practices. Within this context, practices such as herbal baths, psychological support, and ebós—works performed with natural elements like grains, candles, and eggs—are recognized as unique forms of care, grounded in the notion of Kalunga and embodied within terreiro spaces.;"The methodology of our research is grounded in aterrada research. This approach is described in two key references: the book Saberes Plurais e Epistemologias Aterradas (2020) and the article A Pesquisa no Kitembo – pistas para a construção de uma psicologia aterrada (2018). These works outline a methodological framework that seeks to recognize religious leaders as references and co-authors within the research process.
Data collection within this methodology involves presenting knowledge derived from lived experiences — particularly the wisdom of the terreiro — emphasizing its authorship and protagonism. In this sense, the teachings conveyed within the terreiro space by the Nganga (masters and spiritual leaders of the terreiro) serve as central references that contribute to the construction of the research.";In this setting, the figure of the Pomba-Gira emerges as an entity of crossroads and pathways, a producer of both physical and existential movements. Her manifestations occur in dynamic interaction with this vital force, as she herself is an expression of Kalunga—a promoter of care and guidance. Therefore, this work advocates for the recognition of Afro-diasporic epistemo.logies as legitimate producers of care and as foundations for alternative modes of existence and healing.;By valuing these experiences, the study moves away from the model colonial and pathologizing interpretations, opening space for the sensitive listening of Afro-Brazilian expressions of life and culture and affirming their political, subjective, and physical power, particularly in the lives of terreiro black Youth.;"Aphrodiasporic; Africanorigin; religiosity; bantu"

This process imposes a universalized worldview that excludes traditional Afro-Indigenous knowledge and cosmoperceptions from the frameworks of health care. This article aims to challenge that paradigm by presenting Afro-Indigenous traditional knowledge as epistemological and methodological foundations of care within Brazil’s Primary Health Care, based on a lived experience in a Family Clinic in the city of Rio de Janeiro. Grounded in Afro-Indigenous epistemologies and drawing on the practices of psychologia enramada (Santos, 2023), escrevivência (Evaristo, 2020), and psicologia afropindorâmica, the work is rooted in sensitive listening and attention to ancestral ways of life, seeking to integrate spirituality, memory, and care as core principles of integral health. 
";"
The methodology is anchored in the principles of pesquisa aterrada (grounded research) and escrevivência, considering the daily life of favelas, villages, terreiros, and quilombos as loci of knowledge production. Within this context, the article shows how historically marginalized Afro-diasporic knowledge continues to live on through community practices and spiritual experiences of the Black Indigenous Brazilian population—even within public health institutions. 
";Based on the account of a clinical case—the arrival of a Black woman at a health unit, bringing with her the knowledge of Maria Mulambo da Kalûnga (Costa, Santos & Oliveira, 2025)—this text highlights the ways in which entities from Afro-Brazilian cosmology, such as the Pombagiras, are present in the lives of those receiving care, acting as forces of subjective and political reorganization of a lifestyle common within Brazilian territories. The text draws on the authors' “Brazilian-lived” experience (Evaristo, 2020) as psychologists working in public healthcare, along with the theoretical contributions of Black and Indigenous intellectuals. Engaging in dialogue with both scholars and concrete scenes of care in territories marked by resistance and reexistence, the article proposes a territory-listening approach that centers diasporic epistemologies as vital to the reinvention of care. ;"The Black bodies that now traverse universities and care systems carry with them memories of knowledge that defy Eurocentric clinical logic and offer concrete alternatives for promoting bem viver (good living) in public health. Thus, this article argues that health care in Brazil must be radically expanded and reconfigured through the lens of Black Indigenous epistemologies. Within this horizon, afropindorâmica psychology emerges as a concrete possibility for reparative, re-enchanted, and collective healing.

Treatment options include western medicine, acupotomy— a minimally invasive procedure using a needle with a blade-like tip— and a combination of both. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of these three treatment strategies on quality of life and productivity loss in patients with LR.;This randomized, controlled, multicenter pilot trial enrolled patients diagnosed with LR and a Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) pain score greater than 4. Participants were randomly assigned to three groups (n=20 per group): (1) usual Western medicine, (2) deeply inserted acupotomy targeting Hyeopcheok points, or (3) a combination of both treatments. Over a 7-week period, interventions were administered twice weekly for three weeks, followed by two post-treatment follow-up visits within the subsequent four weeks. The 5-level EuroQol 5-Dimension questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L) was used to assess quality of life (QoL). Productivity loss was measured using iMTA Productivity Cost questionnaire (iPCQ), which captures absenteeism, presenteeism, and unpaid work. Outcomes were assessed at four time points over 7 weeks. Between group comparisons were conducted using analysis of covariance, adjusting for baseline values.;Among the 60 patients, the mean age was 53 years and 45% were male. The mean EQ-5D-5L scores at baseline were 0.75, 0.70, and 0.73 for the western medicine, acupotomy, and combination groups respectively. After treatment, the scores increased to 0.79 in both western medicine and acupotomy groups, and 0.75 in the combination group. However, no significant differences were observed among the groups (p=0.14). In terms of productivity loss, absenteeism was reported in only one patient in the acupotomy group. The western medicine group reported the lowest level of presenteeism (236.13 hours), while the combination treatment group demonstrated the least productivity loss in unpaid work (138 hours). Total productivity loss costs were lowest in the combination group ($114.12), compared to the acupotomy group ($200.82), western medicine group ($181.24), with no significant differences (p=0.69).;Although differences in QoL and productivity loss were not significant, the combination of pharmacologic and deeply inserted acupotomy therapy demonstrated potential in reducing productivity-related burden.;"Quality of Life; Productivity Loss; Lumbosacral radiculopathy; iPCQ; Three-arm trial"

Evidence suggests that green spaces may play a protective role against adiposity by promoting physical activity, reducing stress, and enhancing environmental quality. This study aimed to investigate the association between exposure to urban green spaces and adiposity among adolescents participating in a Brazilian birth cohort.;We conducted a cross-sectional analysis within a cohort study using data from 2,446 adolescents (mean age 11.6 years) enrolled in the Ribeirão Preto BRISA cohort. Green space exposure was quantified using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Percentage of Vegetation Cover (PVC), calculated from satellite imagery (CBERS-4A) and geospatial analysis within 300 m and 500 m radii of the participants’ residences. Body fat percentage was measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Generalized linear models were used to estimate associations between vegetation metrics and adiposity, adjusting for socioeconomic class (Critério Brasil - CCEB) and physical activity (assessed using the PAQ-C questionnaire). Analyses were performed using StataSE 14.0, with a significance level set at 5%.;"A consistent inverse association was found between proximity to green spaces and body fat percentage. After adjustments, a higher NDVI at 300 m was associated with lower adiposity (? = –11.10; 95% CI: –17.20 to –5.10; p < 0.001), and similar associations were observed for NDVI at 500 m and PVC in both radii. Surprisingly, adolescents from lower socioeconomic classes (D/E) had lower adiposity compared to higher-income groups, potentially reflecting contextual factors such as increased non-recreational physical activity or food insecurity.";This study highlights the independent role of urban vegetation in reducing adolescent adiposity, suggesting that integrating green infrastructure into urban planning may contribute to the prevention of obesity and promote health equity. Findings support multisectoral policies that prioritize equitable access to green spaces as part of planetary health strategies.;"Adolescent Health; Urban Green Spaces; obesity; Adiposity; Environmental Exposure"

Nonetheless, the human inhabitants of Amazonia suffer disproportionately from health problems associated with inadequate access to clean water and sanitation. For indigenous populations, the situation is even more precarious: poor sanitary conditions contribute to persistently high rates of intestinal parasitism, anemia and malnutrition among indigenous peoples across the Amazon. Climate change is now exacerbating existing problems. For these reasons, achieving UN Global Development Goals, especially GDS-6 relating to water and sanitation, has proven exceptionally challenging among indigenous Amazonian peoples. Even where government WASH investments have reached rural parts of Amazonia, the technologies used are often inappropriate, follow-up and monitoring is minimal to non-existent, and corruption is rampant, leading to a widespread pattern of failed investments, abandoned infrastructure and community cynicism. This presentation summarizes original research on an innovative program of WASH programing carried out by the charity organization Rainforest Flow (rainforestflow.org) in dialog with traditional medical, spiritual and artistic practices.;"This study included a mixture of ethnographic observation of water use and hygienic practices in different indigenous communities before and after implementation of water and sanitation programs, as well as health baseline and follow-up studies:

(1) Results of qualitative social-sanitary questionnaires were  analyzed  to characterize the prevailing social, hygienic and sanitary conditions and practices in project communities before interventions were planned;

(2) Free-listing activities were carried out regarding illness vocabulary, concepts of health and well-being, childcare practices and diet to characterize indigenous categories and concepts regarding health, water and sanitaiton;

(3) Ethnographic observations of water use, sanitary practices, health and dietary practices, and informal interviews concerning community history, local health concepts, diet, water use practices and other topics;

(3) Microbiological analysis of samples taken from different surface water sources in the community;

(4) Baseline health study by a health team based at Cayetano Heredia University in Peru including:  biometric monitoring of nutritional status, microbiological diagnosis of intestinal parasite prevalence, blood hemoglobin analysis studies, and systematic health interviews, followed by follow-up studies to measure health impacts.";Slow-sand filtration technologies implemented as much as 20 years ago have managed to achieve social sustainability and lasting health benefits in the study communities. Health outcomes includes a sustained up to 93% reduction in the prevalence of diarrheal diseases over baseline values, a 74% reduction in mortality caused by diarrheal diseases, significant reduction in many intestinal parasites, and decreasing prevalence of anemia in the populations benefited by this program. However, these aims were not achieved solely by technological interventions alone. The project involved a careful consideration of traditional concepts around water, water-borne diseases and gastrointestinal illness categories. By leveraging traditional concepts about water contamination, educational and hygiene-related activities were targeted to better achieve positive outcomes.;Global WASH interventions have focused on infrastructure, with not enough emphasis on social adaptation of these technologies, nor on long-term monitoring of outcomes. This innovative project has used low-tech solutions in dialog with medical anthropology to achieve sustained health benefits for indigenous communities of Amazonia.;"WASH; Indigenous health; Amazonia; medical pluralism"

Grounded in principles that emphasize the interdependence of human, animal, and environmental health, Homeopathy inherently aligns with several of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This review seeks to critically examine Homeopathy’s potential contributions to sustainable development, emphasizing its ecological attributes and systemic therapeutic approach.;A narrative review was undertaken using a combination of keywords into three main categories: Homeopathy, Sustainability and related concepts (One Health, agrohomeopathy, cost-effectiveness, antimicrobial resistance) . Basic and clinical research on plants, animals, humans and economic studies  was identified through systematic searches of electronic databases including AMED, Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, SCOPUS. The analytical framework was structured around ecological and environmental, social-economical, and person-centered dimensions.;"Homeopathy operates as a low-impact, resource-efficient therapeutic system with applications across human, veterinary, and agricultural contexts. In the European Union, it is officially regulated as a therapeutic option within organic farming, reflecting its ecological compatibility. A prominent example is the development of homeopathy in agriculture, which applies homeopathic principles to plant health management, demonstrating potential for promoting sustainable, pesticide-free agriculture with improved crop resilience and productivity.
From an ecological perspective, homeopathy is characterized by minimal material consumption, low residual environmental impact, and non-toxic preparation processes. Its medicines, prepared through serial dilution and succussion, require negligible quantities of physical substances, resulting in limited waste generation and reduced ecological burden. Furthermore, the decentralized and small-scale nature of homeopathic medicine production offers opportunities for energy conservation and the reinforcement of local economies.
At a systemic level, homeopathy embodies a holistic model of care, addressing physical, mental, emotional, and environmental determinants of health. Its integrative approach complements the One Health paradigm by recognizing the interconnectedness of human, animal, and ecosystem health, thereby contributing to planetary wellbeing. Notably, homeopathy has shown potential in mitigating eco-toxicity, promoting detoxification in human, animal, and plant systems, and supporting the recovery of ecological balance following environmental disturbances.
Homeopathy’s systemic utility extends to contemporary public health challenges, including antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and the risks of polypharmacy. As a non-toxic, adjunctive therapy, it offers potential to reduce reliance on pharmaceuticals and mitigate adverse drug effects, particularly in fields such as Integrative Oncology, where it is employed to alleviate the side effects of conventional cancer treatments.
Additionally, homeopathy contributes to the social dimension of sustainable development through its emphasis on patient empowerment, holistic mental and emotional health care, and cost-effective service delivery. Emerging evidence indicates high levels of user satisfaction and economic efficiency associated with homeopathic care.";Positioned within the TCIH framework, homeopathy offers a distinct ecological and systemic therapeutic paradigm with potential contributions to sustainable development. Its low environmental footprint, resource-efficient methodologies, and holistic health model align with contemporary ecological and public health priorities. However, further empirical research is required to substantiate and operationalize its role within sustainable healthcare systems and broader ecological health initiatives.;"Planetary Health; One Health; Well-Being Societies; Homeopathy; Empowerment"

In Colombia, although these practices are authorized within the General System of Social Security in Health (SGSSS), a lack of detailed data on their users limits informed decision-making, strategic planning, and the design of integrative care models. This study aimed to characterize the profile of users within the contributory regime who accessed CAM services between 2011 and 2019, and to identify usage patterns and regional distribution of service availability.;This is a retrospective, quantitative, cross-sectional observational study. It included users from the contributory regime of the SGSSS who accessed CAM services from 2011 to 2019. Main data sources were official administrative databases: BDUA, SISPRO, and the UPC calculation database. CAM services were identified using active CUPS codes. Sociodemographic, clinical (Charlson Comorbidity Index), and utilization variables were analyzed. Data were processed using Stata 17.;"Data from 234,843 users were analyzed. Women represented 66% of users, and the average age increased from 42.7 years in 2011 to 54 years in 2019. Most users were at low risk of mortality (Charlson 0–2). Nonetheless, 14.9% had diabetes, 9.9% chronic pulmonary disease, and 8.2% cancer, suggesting that CAM is sought by patients with complex chronic conditions.

Geographically, 65% of demand was concentrated in Bogotá, Cundinamarca, Antioquia, and Santander. Only 16 out of 39 health insurers (EPS) in the contributory regime reported CAM services, with one EPS accounting for 46% of all cases, indicating a high concentration in service provision. Despite being part of the official benefits plan, overall utilization remained low (<0.005). A high frequency of generic CUPS codes was observed, limiting the precise characterization of the therapies actually provided.";"The study reveals low reported use and uneven distribution of CAM services within Colombia's contributory health regime, with marked disparities by region and insurer. The overuse of generic procedure codes hinders traceability and limits the ability to assess the type and impact of specific therapies. It is essential to improve standardization and training in CAM coding and recording practices. The adoption of CIE-11, specifically Chapter 26 on traditional medicine conditions, presents an opportunity to enhance the visibility and regulation of CAM services.

To optimize the integration of CAM within health systems, it is critical to strengthen provider training, ensure better data quality, and promote equitable access.

We found that Tui Na increased height comparing to routine health care alone (29 trials, mean 3.68 cm, 95% CI (confidence interval) [2.92, 4.43], low-quality evidence) and to touch (2 trials, mean 1.72 cm, 95% CI [1.22, 2.22], low-quality evidence). Adding Tui Na to touch resulted in a height increase of 1.99 cm (5 trials, mean 95% CI [1.04, 2.95], low-quality evidence). Subgroups of normal children (Tui Na for 3-4 months, 5-6 months, 12 months) and preterm children (Tui Na for 3-4 months, 12 months) both showed significant benefits. Tui Na was also beneficial for the growth of height, weight, head circumference, chest circumference, waist circumference and BMI, as well as parental satisfaction comparing to routine health care. Comparing to touch, Tui Na was beneficial for growth of height, weight and head circumference. Tui Na also showed additional benefits in growth of height, weight and head circumference added to touch. In most subgroups, we consistently found benefits across different Tui Na time ranges. Tui Na’s effects are clearer among normal children when applied for 3 months rather than preterm infants. The overall risk of bias of the included trials was unclear or high. The main issues were insufficient reporting on randomization, allocation concealment, outcome assessor blinding, and incomplete outcome reporting. Our study also addressed the overall response rate, the safety of the intervention, and the satisfaction of children/parents, limited evidence was found.;This evaluation indicates that Tui Na over 3 months can promote children’s growth and appears to be safe, with high parental satisfaction. It may have a significant benefits on normal children’s growth, for preterm infants, long-term Tui Na may be required. However, large-sample and high-quality RCTs and real-world observations with long-term follow-up are needed to confirm these findings. Based on the existing evidence, it is recommended to implement Tui Na for 3-6 months or longer, and from the perspective of economics and parent-child relationships, we suggest widely promoting Tui Na in families or communities to maintain health and improve children's growth. For future research, it is recommended that these trials clearly define the age and comorbidities of children in their design. Additionally, they should consider interventions with adequate length and the need for a family-based setting. Outcomes related to implementation, such as health economics and child acceptance, should be evaluated. Long-term follow-up is also essential. Large real-world observations with long-term follow up in community settings are also important for clinical reference.;"Pediatric Tui Na; Growth; Randomized Controlled Trial; Systematic Review; Meta-Analysis"

In 2019, RTIs were the leading cause of death from infectious diseases. Preparations from Echinacea species are among the most commonly used phytomedicines for RTIs. We examined whether any preparation from Echinacea ssp. could reduce the need for use of antibiotics by preventing RTIs and their complications, and investigated its safety profile under conditions of an RCT.;Systematic search of databases EMBASE, PubMed, Google Scholar, Cochrane DARE, clinicaltrials.gov. The inclusion criteria were RCTs testing Echinacea preparations for the prevention or treatment of RTIs,also reporting on RTI-related complications and/or use of antibiotics. Meta-analytical methods (common and random effect model) were applied to quantify differences in RTI incidence and antibiotic usage between treatment and control groups.;"30 RCTs with 39 comparisons between Echinacea and placebo, resp. other controls and overall 5652 randomized subjects could be retrieved. Echinacea significantly reduced the monthly RTI occurrence (risk ratio RR, common effect model 0.68 (95% CI: 0.61–0.77) and the number of participants with ? 1 RTI (RR=0.75 [95% CI 0.69–0.81]), corresponding to an odds ratio OR=0.53 [95% CI 0.42–0.67]. It reduced recurrent infections (RR=0.60; 95% CI 0.46–0.80), RTI complications (RR=0.44; 95% CI 0.36–0.54), and the need for antibiotic therapy (RR=0.60; 95% CI 0.39–0.93), with total antibiotic therapy days reduced by 70% (individual risk ratio IRR=0.30; 95% CI: 0.12–0.73). Alcoholic extracts from freshly harvested Echinacea purpurea showed the strongest effect when reducing AB treatment days by 80% (IRR 0.21; 95% CI 0.15–0.29). Adverse events were comparable between Echinacea and control groups (RR =0.99 ; 95% CI 0.93–1.05).";"Echinacea preparations appear to be both effective and safe in preventing RTIs and reducing associated complications. In addition, they can contribute to a substantial reduction in the use of antibiotics. Efficacy seems to vary by Echinacea species and preparation method, highlighting the need for product-specific evaluations in future studies.

This study explored parents' understanding and use of antibiotics in the treatment of children's colds over a decade (2015 and 2025), with the aim of informing evidence-based prescribing for the usage as well as knowledge translation of antibiotics for children’s colds.;A cross-sectional survey was conducted using an online questionnaire (Wenjuanxing, https://www.wjx.cn) with convenience sampling. We analyzed changes in parental knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding antibiotic use for children's colds between 2015 and 2025, as well as whether they were with medical backgrounds (referring to anything related to medicine, including clinisions, nurses, medical researchers and policy makers) were analyzed.;" In 2015 and 2025, we collected 556 (valid: 442) and 940 (valid: 870) parent responses (Female respondents accounted for 77.15% and 81.84% ,mainly aged 31-40, 70.36% and 66.21%). The proportion of respondents with medical-related occupations was significantly higher in 2015 (31.22%) than in 2025 (5.98%). By 2025, medical professionals showed improved recognition of common antibiotics, but their ability to correctly identify indications had declined. In contrast, non-medical professionals demonstrated lower antibiotic recognition and indication knowledge than medical professionals, but the proportion of those who recognize antibiotics has increased. In 2025, more non-medical parents indicated strict adherence to doctors' advice, while the proportion administering leftover antibiotics to children without consultation remained unchanged. The proportion of parents obtaining antibiotics through a doctor's prescription increased, while the proportion of parents purchasing antibiotics from pharmacies decreased. In 2025, 3.79% of parents added an online access method. Parents' preference for home-based treatment of pediatric colds remained stable. However, from 2015 to 2025, the use of non-antibiotic Western medicine and antibiotics at home by parents decreased. Meanwhile, preference for traditional Chinese medicine at home rose. More parents also chose to seek treatment at hospitals. The proportion of people who prefer to seek treatment at hospitals has risen, including TCM hospitals, Western medicine hospitals and integrated hospitals. In the choice of TCM for treating colds, both groups of respondents preferred Chinese patent medicine.

Early intervention with traditional Chinese medicine has shown good therapeutic effects. According to the “Guidance of diagnosis and treatment for influenza (Version 2020)”, Yinqiao San (Lonicera japonica Thunb. and Forsythia suspensa (Thunb.) Vahl Powder) is recommended for the pattern of wind-heat assailing the defense (wei) syndrome, while Jingfang Baidu San (Schizonepeta  tenuifolia (Benth.) Briq. and Saposhnikovia divaricata (Turcz.) Schischk. Powder) is recommended for the pattern of wind-cold fettering the exterior (biao) syndrome. This study selected two classic TCM therapeutic methods, pungent-cool exterior-releasing (represented by Yinqiao San) and pungent-warm exterior-releasing (represented by Jingfang Baidu San), as examples to explore the similarities and differences in their modern pharmacological mechanisms in treating influenza, providing a scientific basis for precise clinical medication.;The information of the constituent drugs of the two prescriptions was obtained from the Herb 2.0 database. Combined with the influenza-related targets screened from databases such as GeneCards, the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD), and Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM), the common targets and specific targets of Yinqiao San and Jingfang Baidu San in treating influenza were identified. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed using the String database, and the target set was subjected to gene ontology (GO) biological function annotation and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis through the Metascape database to clarify the commonalities and differences in their mechanisms of action.;"The related pathways of the two prescriptions in treating influenza both involve Oxidative phosphorylation (Energy metabolism), Thermogenesis (Environmental adaptation), and FoxO signaling pathway (Signal transduction), etc. The pathways related to Yinqiao San (pungent-cool exterior-releasing) are mainly enriched in Leukocyte transendothelial migration (Immune system), JAK-STAT signaling pathway (Signal transduction), Th1 and Th2 cell differentiation (Immune system), etc.; the pathways related to Jingfang Baidu San (pungent-warm exterior-releasing) are mainly enriched in Prolactin (PRL) signaling pathway (Endocrine system), ErbB signaling pathway (Signal transduction), and cAMP signaling pathway (Signal transduction) etc.";The research results show that both Yinqiao San and Jingfang Baidu San can play an intervention role in the early stage of influenza by regulating immunity, antiviral activity, and inhibiting inflammation. However, their core mechanisms of action reflect the fundamental differences between the pungent-cool exterior-releasing and pungent-warm exterior-releasing methods in TCM: Yinqiao San (pungent-cool exterior-releasing) focuses on relieving wind-heat and clearing heat-toxicity, with advantages in fine-tuning immune balance (such as leukocyte migration, Th cell differentiation, JAK-STAT signaling). while Jingfang Baidu San (pungent-warm exterior-releasing) focuses on inducing sweating and resolving exterior cold, and exerts its effects by enhancing the body’s stress response (such as prolactin signaling), protecting cardiovascular function, and maintaining energy metabolism (such as cAMP signaling). The significant differences in the pathways of action of the two prescriptions (fine-tuning immune balance vs. enhancing stress metabolism) provide a modern pharmacological basis for the precise differentiation and treatment of wind-heat invading the defensive qi syndrome and wind-cold binding the exterior syndrome in the early stage of influenza in traditional Chinese medicine.;"Wind-cold syndrome; Wind-heat syndrome; Jingfang Baidu San; Yin Qiao San; Influenza; "

While mind-body therapies such as yoga, meditation, and acupuncture have shown promise in modulating immune responses in adults, their safety and effectiveness in pediatric populations remain underexplored. This protocol outlines the methodology for a systematic review and meta-analysis aimed at evaluating the effects of mind-body therapies on immune modulation in children and adolescents. PROSPERO Registration: CRD42024546585;This systematic review and meta-analysis will follow PRISMA 2020 reporting guidelines. We will include randomized controlled trials, nonrandomized controlled trials, cohort studies, and case-control studies that examine the relationship between mind-body therapies and immune markers in pediatric populations. Electronic searches will be conducted in MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library, supplemented by trial registries. Risk of bias will be assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool (RoB 1), the Risk of Bias in Non-randomized Studies of Interventions (ROBINS-I), and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS). Two independent reviewers will screen studies, extract data, and assess study quality, with a third reviewer resolving any discrepancies. Results will be synthesized both narratively and through meta-analysis using R software.;We anticipate identifying a growing body of evidence suggesting that mind-body therapies may influence both pro- and anti-inflammatory immune markers in pediatric populations. Based on preliminary screening, it is likely that findings will vary across studies in terms of magnitude and consistency of effects. We also expect to gather data on feasibility, safety, and dropout rates associated with mind-body therapies in children and adolescents.;The review will evaluate the effectiveness and safety of mind-body therapies on immune markers in children and adolescents. The synthesized evidence will guide clinical practice and public health policies in integrating mind-body therapies into pediatric care. The findings will also provide a foundation for future research and policymaking in this area.;"Mind-Body-Medicine; Immune System; pediatrics; Meta-Analysis; Inflammation"

Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) have proven effective for mild to moderate depression and anxiety. However, evidence on their feasibility and effectiveness in real-world settings, especially in low- and middle-income countries, remains limited. This study explored the acceptability and feasibility of Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) as an adjunct to usual treatment in Brazilian Primary Health Care (PHC).;This prospective exploratory study is part of a larger doctoral project based on a Stepped Wedge Randomized Clinical Trial (RCT-SW) that compares Mindfulness Based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (MCBT) with usual treatment in six PHC units managed by OSS Fundação Pio XII. In this pilot study, we specifically evaluated MBCT's feasibility, aiming for a 50% recruitment rate with a qualitative analysis assessed the intervention's acceptability. Feasibility was measured by tracking appointments, patient inclusion, and attendance using PHC records. For the qualitative analysis, semi-structured interviews were conducted with diverse participants, audio-recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using Bardin's thematic content analysis framework.;"Of 340 patients screened from primary care for mild to moderate anxiety and depression, 239 (70.2%) met inclusion criteria. Of these, 127 (53.1%) attended the first mindfulness session, and 119 (49.7%) attended at least 4 of the 8 protocol sessions. These figures indicate reasonable recruitment and adherence, suggesting MBCT's viability in PHC.
Qualitative analysis of 15 participant interviews revealed three main categories:
1.	Conceptions about Integrative Practices (PICS): Most participants had limited prior knowledge of integrative practices, often associating yoga or meditation with relaxation rather than therapeutic applications. This highlights the need for more education on these practices' potential.
2.	Coping with Difficult Situations: Participants often used personal coping strategies like social isolation or distraction, typically without formal guidance. MBCT helped fill this gap, with participants reporting significant positive changes in emotional regulation, well-being, and daily engagement.
3.	Barriers to Implementation: Logistical issues like inconvenient schedules and transportation, along with a desire for more frequent and longer sessions, were key barriers. Participants also expressed a need for more opportunities to share and deepen their practice.";Findings suggest MBCT is feasible and well-received in primary care, despite logistical and structural challenges. While nearly half of patients attended at least half of the sessions, adherence was impacted by schedule conflicts, transportation, and session formats. The lack of prior knowledge about integrative practices underscores the need for ongoing health education. These results emphasize integrating such practices more effectively into primary care through structural adjustments, better logistical planning, and continuous health education to enhance accessibility and long-term benefits. The study reinforces the importance of a comprehensive, structured approach to implementing mindfulness-based interventions in community health.;"Mindfulness; Depression; Primary Health Health Care; Implementation Science"

Conventional treatment options for menopausal hot flashes are contraindicated in hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer patients or associated with adverse effects. This indicates the need for therapies with fewer side effects to improve treatment adherence and, consequently, reduce the risk of cancer recurrence. Acupuncture is a holistic regulatory therapy with a history of approx. 3000 years as part of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). Evidence suggests that body acupuncture is an effective and safe treatment for hot flashes. Auricular acupuncture has demonstrated effects comparable to body acupuncture while offering several advantages, including improved practicality and feasibility in clinical settings. The aim of this clinical trial is to analyze the impact of auricular acupuncture on side effects caused by endocrine treatment, primarily hot flashes in breast cancer survivors.;99 women between 18 and 75 years with non-metastatic breast cancer going through endocrine treatment and suffering from hot flashes will be enrolled. This three-armed, single-centered randomized and registered clinical trial (CT number: NCT06369168) compares two methods of auricular acupuncture with a waitlist-control-group. One intervention group is treated with balanced auricular acupuncture, which is a semi-standardized method developed by Jan Seeber. The second intervention group receives auricular acupuncture with the points used in the NADA (National Acupuncture Detoxification Association) protocol, which is standardized and used for patients experiencing stress, trauma and mental illness. The trial includes three questionnaire assessments: a baseline assessment prior to the start of the trial, an endline assessment six weeks after the intervention has started, and a follow-up assessment three months after the end of the last treatment. Patients in the treatment arms receive two auricular acupunctures per week over the course of five weeks, compared to a waitlist control group, with no treatment during the trial period. The study evaluates primarily hot flashes and, secondarily, assesses additional symptoms caused by endocrine treatment, including stress perception, psychological effects, insomnia and urogenital symptoms.;"To date (June 2025), 94 out of 99 participants have been recruited. 45 women have received the intervention treatments until now. Preliminary results of this study will be presented at the congress in Rio de Janeiro in October 2025.
Endocrine treatment can trigger a range of menopausal-like vasovagal symptoms, including insomnia and hot flashes. Based on positive study results on auricular acupuncture in insomnia patients, we anticipate similarly beneficial effects in patients experiencing hot flashes. This would support existing research highlighting the importance of integrating approaches from diverse healing traditions to optimize holistic treatment of cancer patients.";"If the results of the study confirm our assumptions based on the current state of research, this would strengthen the evidence in Integrative Oncology and suggest a broader clinical application of acupuncture as a complementary breast cancer patient treatment.

Professional definitions are essential in the United States and other regulated healthcare environments to guide certification, scope of practice, and research. The International Association of Yoga Therapists (IAYT) provides the only globally available consensus definition of yoga therapy, developed to support integration into healthcare systems that require clearly defined interventions and evidence-based protocols. However, yoga therapy is practiced and studied globally, often through cultural frameworks that do not align with Western healthcare structures. 

As U.S.-based researchers, we conducted a scoping review to assess how yoga therapy is described in published primary clinical research and how the practice is defined. We also examined how the description of yoga therapy aligns with the IAYT definition published in 2016. Our goal was not to evaluate diverse practices, but to understand the characteristics of the literature using the term yoga therapy, the context in which the term is used, and how existing literature supports the integration of yoga therapy into healthcare systems that depend on standardized definitions and rigorous evidence.";PubMed, Embase, CENTRAL and PEDro were searched in January 2024 for primary studies published since 2016 which included ‘yoga therapy’, ‘yoga therapies’, ‘yoga therapist’ or ‘yoga therapists’ in the title or abstract and which described the results of applying ‘yoga therapy’ to individuals for improving health. Searches of PubMed, CENTRAL, and PEDro were updated in January 2025. After deduplication, two authors independently screened the title and abstract of each record and then screened the full text of potentially relevant studies. Two authors then independently extracted data on definitions of yoga therapy and descriptions of protocol authorship, practitioner training, and individualized assessments from included studies. All disagreements were resolved by discussion.;"Searches retrieved a total of 2093 records. After deduplication, 1394 records were screened, 334 studies were assessed in full text, and 180 studies were included. A majority of studies were published by Indian authors (134/180; 74%) and studies were most commonly published in complementary or integrative medicine (including yoga or ayurveda) journals (n=85) followed by specialty journals (n=63). Approximately half of the studies described randomized controlled trials (93/180; 52%). Regardless of geographic origin, most studies (165/180; 85%) did not provide a definition of yoga therapy. Few studies included sufficient information to determine alignment with the IAYT framework. Commonly missing elements included protocol development, practitioner qualifications and certifications, and assessment procedures. This lack of comprehensive reporting limits the strength of evidence in clinical practice guidelines and poses challenges to healthcare integration.";The therapeutic value of yoga is not in question. However, more transparent reporting and methodological rigor are needed to support the integration of yoga therapy into healthcare systems that rely on defined standards and evidence grades. This review encourages cultural respect, definitional transparency, and global dialogue to strengthen the integration of yoga therapy into health care delivery.;"Yoga Therapy; Integrative Medicine; evidence-based practice; International Association of Yoga Therapists"

This study      evaluated adherence to homeopathic medicine among PNCT participants   in Recife and Camaragibe,  and examined whether their  use was associated with a reduction or cessation in the average number of cigarettes smoked daily     .;A structured   questionnaire was developed to assess   adherence to homeopathic medicines as a complementary intervention within      the PNCT protocol. In  partnership with the Health Departments of the Recife and Camaragibe (Pernambuco, Brazil), primary health providing smoking      cessation  services were selected. H     omeopathic medicines were prepared in accordance      with      the Brazilian Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia, 3rd edition, using the Hahnemannian method. The starting material      was      obtained by extracting smoke from each      participant's      cigarette using the Isomaker® device. M     edicines were      dispensed in 6CH potency, in tablet form. Patients were instructed to take three tablets in the morning and evening, plus      one tablet whenever they felt like smoking. Standard PNCT The smoking cessation protocol also included conventional pharmacotherapy with nicotine patches and bupropion hydrochloride, following PNCT guidelines. Homeopathic intervention was incorporated into the program from May 15, 2025, with participants receiving individualized follow-up .;The initiative is underway in the public health system of the state of Pernambuco. Preliminary results include 100 patients who received a homeopathic medicine made from their own cigarette smoke. In the Family Health Units (USF) located in the city of Recife, 62 patients were treated, distributed as follows: Santa Terezinha Island (11), Guabiraba (06), Jardim São Paulo (17), Santo Amaro 2 (10), Santo Amaro 3 (6) and Chão de Estrela (12). In the city of Camaragibe, 38 patients were treated at the USFs Assa Branca (1), Bairro Novo 1 (12) and Bairro Novo 2 (13), Sala do Servidor (08), Vale das Pedreiras (04).;"The  integration of individualized homeopathic medicines into the PNCT is feasible within the public health system and well accepted by participants.

To carry out this journey, we will list conceptual aspects through the Wisdom of Care of the Indigenous Peoples of the Earth, and specifically supported by the notion of ""Teko Porã"", or Well-Being, present in the Guarani people, which expresses a worldview that guides the lifestyle of the people, seeking balance and harmony among beings, having as an interdependent value respect for Nature. This confluence with indigenous knowledge will be methodologically supported in dialogue with Environmental Psychology, mainly through the concepts of lifestyle, spirituality, awareness and quality of life.";The research is framed as a theoretical approach and descriptive objective, having as its procedure the carrying out of a bibliographical survey. The focus of the work aims to examine how the conceptualization of the notions of health and disease provides us with historical understandings of human and planetary illness and, consequently, forms of care and understanding of the processes of illness. The chosen methodological path will be the articulation of Planetary Health, Environmental Psychology and the decolonial knowledge of the Original Peoples of the Earth. Through this methodological confluence, we intend to show how environmental psychology and planetary health methodologies can dialogue with decolonial studies for the comprehensive development of climate change and contemporary pathologies from the same vital nexus.;From a movement of decolonization of health, an ecological, integrative and inter-relational character of the health-disease process is revealed, and in this sense we can connect the forms of understanding and care of the individual human processes of illness as an epochal trait, where we also open up an understanding that The Fall of the Sky, which represents, according to the Yanomami Shaman Davi Kopenawa, the consummation of the ecological crisis we are going through, is produced by the same vital historical nexus that not only makes humanity collectively ill in the contemporary world, but also other forms of life on Earth.;This process of collective illness is driven by the historical participation of human presence in the very way it inhabits the Earth. In view of the process of desertification of the Earth and the collective human and more-than-human illness in the contemporary world, we will trace a vital nexus that connects both processes of illness in the Being-Earth, named as The Fall of the Sky by Davi Kopenawa, and as Cosmophobia by the quilombola master Nego Bispo. Our main challenge is to articulate different areas of knowledge in a way that allows us to access this phenomenon in a multidimensional and holistic way.;"Decolonization of Health; Planetary Health; climate change; Philosophy of Health; Environmental Psychology"

This study aimed to develop the hetero-isotherapeutic from cigarette smoke and to investigate the efficacy of homeopathic treatment for smoking cessation.;The double-blind, randomized, controlled clinical trial had 84 participants and was approved by Certificate of Ethical Appreciation (CAEE 65622916.2.0000.5257). Two different homeopathic interventions were used: Nux vomica (control group) and the individualized homeopathic preparation, heteroisotherapic, which was prepared with the Isomaker® apparatus (tested group). This device allows the extraction of smoke from the participant´s cigarette, which is used as the starting solution for the homeopathic dilution procedure. Nux vomica and heteroisoterapic remedies were randomly offered for 90 days. The Nux vomica group (n=42) and the heteroisoterapic group included smokers (n=42), and the drugs were taken three tablets in the morning and evening and one tablet before each urge to smoke. Inclusion criteria were at least 18 years of age, both sexes, wanting to quit smoking, and participant must be a current smoker, i.e. someone who smokes daily or occasionally. Exclusion criteria were not being a smoker, only being a passive smoker, being an ex-smoker, and being under the age of 18. Participants who were enrolled in the study but refused to respond adequately to the follow-up questionnaire or failed to attend monthly evaluation meetings with the team were also excluded. The primary outcome was tobacco cessation. Secondary outcomes were reduction in tobacco dependence and adverse events.;There was a between-group difference in tobacco cessation, which was increased (p<0.05) in the hetero-isotherapeutic group (40.0%) compared with the Nux vomica group (21.4%). Thus, the superior efficacy of the individualized hetero-isotherapeutic preparation is demonstrated over the standardized Nux vomica. Both treatments decrease the number of cigarettes smoked per day, with a 60.0% reduction in the hetero-isotherapeutic group and 78.6% in the Nux vomica group (p>0.05). In addition, the data showed the absence of adverse events in both groups.;The data showed that the homeopathic medicines played a significant role in reducing tobacco dependence in the groups by improving the cessation or reduction in the number of cigarettes smoked. Moreover, these results provide evidence for personalized homeopathic interventions in tobacco cessation. They also suggest the need for future placebo-controlled studies to determine the absolute efficacy of these interventions compared to conventional treatments for tobacco use disorders.;"Homeopathy; tobacco use disorder; smoking cessation"

More and more integration of clinical practices and health social workers were constructed to improve overall outcomes for the patients with overweight problems. The response adaptive randomization (RAR) method adjusts the randomization probability during the trial process, thus more subjects are treated with better therapies and can benefit from the clinical trial. This study has been approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of Guang’anmen Hospital, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences.   
Objectives: This study was designed to explore the effectiveness of enhanced lifestyle intervention by health social workers on overweight or obesity using RAR design.  ";In this RAR trial, 34 patients with overweight or obesity were included. During the first stage, 8 participants were randomly assigned to the treatment or control groups (1:1). At the second stage, every next participant was assigned with the updated allocation proportion determined by the allocation function as the response accumulation. The treatment group received enhanced lifestyle intervention by health social workers based on traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) for 12 weeks, while the control group only received TCM therapy. The primary outcome referred to changes in body weight from baseline to 12 weeks post-intervention, and the proportion of participants achieving over 5% weight reduction was also calculated. Waist-to-hip ratio, blood lipid, blood glucose, uric acid, insulin levels, liver and gallbladder ultrasound, phlegm-heat syndrome scale, psychological outcomes and so on were assessed. The safety outcome included all adverse events occurring in the course of the study.;"Of 34 patients included in this study, 21 of which were finally assigned to the treatment group, the remaining 13 were assigned to the control group. Enhanced lifestyle intervention by health social workers based on TCM therapy for 12 weeks reduced weight significantly (WMD=3.89, SD=5.15; P=0.030), lowered BMI (WMD=1.53, SD=1.75; P=0.016), decreased triglycerides levels (SMD=0.10, SD=0.28; P=0.042), lower phlegm-heat syndrome scores (SMD=3.13, SD=1.93; P=0.004), and relieve anxiety (P =0.006) compared with the control group. Seven patients (35.0%) in the treatment group achieved a reduction ratio more than or equal to 5% in weight relative to the baseline level, while there was none in the control group (P=0.026). A subset of the patients in the treatment group underwent the survey and interview after 12-week treatment, revealing that it could help learn more about weight management, increase their understanding of obesity and related diseases, enhance their ability of self-management of weight, and put forward that traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) formulations should prioritize portability and appropriate recipe should be provided from patients’ perspective.";Enhanced lifestyle intervention by health social workers based on TCM therapy could decrease weight, BMI, and triglycerides levels, relieve anxiety, improve phlegm-heat syndrome scores, and have fewer adverse events, providing clinical evidence for weight management strategies. The RAR method enabled more patients to receive a better treatment, therefore benefited from a clinical trial and met ethical requirement, contributing to the promotion of RAR method.;"Enhanced lifestyle intervention; social work intervention; overweight; obesity; response adaptive randomization"

Following the guidelines of the Ministry of Health and scientific evidence recommending the use of non-pharmacological therapies associated with health education, a group therapy protocol called the FloreSer Program was developed. This protocol includes Integrative and Complementary Health Practices (PICS), Social Technologies (TS), and Health Education actions, lasting 12 weeks of weekly face-to-face meetings. 
In order to understand the perceptions and self-care strategies adopted by women with fibromyalgia after participating in FloreSer, a qualitative analysis was conducted 9 to 12 months after the end of the first and second editions of the program, through an Integrative Community Therapy (TCI) circle in a new face-to-face meeting.";The sample for the qualitative study consisted of women with fibromyalgia who met again in September 2024 after participating in the first two editions of FloreSer, completed in 2023, in order to evaluate the effects of the program in relation to self-care. The activity was conducted through an Integrative Community Therapy (ICT) circle, with guiding questions, namely: “You who take care of everyone, how is your self-care?” and “Did the FloreSER Program help you in your self-care process and in the use of Integrative Health Practices?” The statements were recorded for later transcription of the content using Microsoft Word and reviewed manually. The analysis followed Bardin's (2011) content analysis technique, organized in three stages: pre-analysis, exploration of the material, and treatment of the results with inference and interpretation.;"The event lasted 1 hour and 15 minutes, and the transcript of the content totaled approximately 70 pages.

Testimonials that reported the welcome received and the sense of belonging reveal the positive and significant impact of the program.
PICS were addressed as active tools in promoting self-care with a fundamental role in reframing illness through practices such as auriculotherapy, foot baths, reiki, and TCI, where they were able to experience, in addition to pain relief, a way of reconnecting with themselves.
Self-care emerged not only through the ability to promote and maintain health, but also through a process of conscious decision-making and lifestyle changes.
A significant shift toward demedicalization was observed, not only in the cessation of medication use, but also in the adoption of practices such as aromatherapy.";The interventions proposed by the FloreSER program, using PICS as tools for conscious change, promoted health with self-care as the main pillar.

Investigating their correlation with respiratory infectious diseases holds significant value for optimizing routine prevention strategies. Located in the tropical-subtropical transition zone, Guangdong Province, China, features high temperature, humidity, prolonged rainy seasons, and frequent extreme weather events, providing a unique setting for studying climate-driven epidemic dynamics. This study systematically analyzes correlations between six respiratory infectious diseases and monthly mean temperature, precipitation, and extreme weather events using surveillance data (2023–2025), aiming to reveal regional climate-disease interaction mechanisms and support climate-sensitive public health early-warning systems.;Data were extracted from Guangdong CDC’s monthly disease reports (January 2023–February 2025) and provincial meteorological records. Statistical analyses (SPSS 26.0) included Pearson correlation for linear associations and Spearman’s rank correlation for non-normally distributed data. Six disease incidence rates and three climate indicators were analyzed, with statistical significance set at P<0.05 and effect sizes (correlation coefficients *r*) indicating strength/direction.;"Preliminary analyses revealed significant climate-disease associations with pathogen-specific response patterns (P<0.05): COVID-19 showed strong positive correlations with mean monthly temperature (*r*=0.66), precipitation (*r*=0.805), and extreme weather events (*r*=0.511), suggesting accelerated transmission under warm, humid, and extreme conditions. Pulmonary tuberculosis correlated positively with precipitation (*r*=0.703), while mumps linked to temperature (*r*=0.594) and precipitation (*r*=0.769), indicating humidity-driven pathogen survival/host behavior changes. Scarlet fever (*r*=?0.512) and influenza (*r*=?0.555) incidence decreased with rising temperature, potentially due to pathogen suppression or reduced human aggregation. Pearson analysis further validated robustness: COVID-19 maintained positive correlations (temperature: *r*=0.453; precipitation: *r*=0.6025; extreme events: *r*=0.5236); tuberculosis exhibited dual positive correlations (temperature: *r*=0.7084; precipitation: *r*=0.6694); mumps demonstrated strong temperature (*r*=0.7383) and precipitation (*r*=0.7083) synergism. Notably, divergent pathogen responses (e.g., temperature promoting COVID-19 but suppressing influenza) highlighted climate sensitivity variations.";Major respiratory infectious diseases in Guangdong exhibit significant climate sensitivity with pathogen-specific response patterns. Public health agencies should integrate climate forecasting to pre-allocate resources during high-risk conditions. Future studies require extended timelines and climate-change scenario modeling to assess long-term epidemic evolution under global warming, informing adaptive public health policies.;"espiratory infectious diseases; Climate factors; Correlation analysis; Guangdong Province; Public health strategies"

With societal development, high-calorie diets have become one of the causes of allergic diseases. According to traditional Chinese medicine, the Yangming meridian is associated with abundant qi and blood. High-calorie diets can lead to intestinal heat accumulation, resulting in a state of mild intestinal inflammation, which ultimately contributes to the development of allergic diseases. The research team conducted a cross-sectional survey of 442 kindergartens in Longgang District, Shenzhen, involving 120,198 children. The results showed that 47.36% of the children had gastrointestinal heat accumulation. Among the 28,596 children with allergic diseases, 57.98% had gastrointestinal heat accumulation.Based on the TCM theory of the Yangming possessing abundant qi and blood, this study aimed to investigate the intrinsic relationship between allergic diseases and gastrointestinal heat accumulation, providing holistic strategies and methods for their prevention and treatment.;"Study sets ""allergy"" as the keyword, the classic medical records of the ""Ancient and Modern Medical Case Cloud Platform"" were searched, and medical cases containing allergic symptoms were screened, and a total of 497 ancient medical cases and modern famous traditional Chinese medicine medical cases with clear records of allergy-related symptoms (such as nasal discharge and poisoning rash) were included, with a time span from 1808 AD to the present. The thematic analysis method was used to summarize the relationship between Yangming gastrointestinal heat accumulation and allergic manifestations from three aspects: symptoms, symptoms and treatment. Combine modern research to explain traditional theories.";The study found that among the 497 medical cases, heat was the most frequent syndrome, accounting for 16.26% of the total frequency. The results of symptom analysis showed that red tongue was the main symptom of allergic diseases, accounting for 19.32% of the total frequency, and constipation was the primary symptom of fecal symptoms, accounting for 4.43% of the total frequency of symptoms. The analysis of treatment results showed that the drugs were mainly used to clear heat and detoxify, clear heat and cool blood, accounting for 10.50% and 5.67% of the total frequency, respectively. Yangming gastrointestinal physiology has strong qi and blood, and pathology is very easy to stagnate and turn into heat, forming a state of gastrointestinal heat accumulation. ;Studies have shown that Yangming is prone to the development of empirical syndrome and heat syndrome is one of the core pathogenesis of allergic diseases, and gastrointestinal heat accumulation is a key link in it. Therefore, harmonizing Yangming qi and blood and clearing gastrointestinal heat accumulation are important treatments for the prevention and treatment of allergic diseases.

It can effectively inhibit viral replication, reduce lung inflammation, and lower the risk of post-infection complications. To fully explore the potential of TCM in treating viral pneumonia, it is necessary to systematically evaluate its historical efficacy and the latest research trends. This study aims to explore the research hotspots and future directions of TCM in the treatment of viral pneumonia, providing references for relevant researchers.;" Based on the Web of Science database, this study conducted a bibliometric and visualization analysis of the literature related to TCM in the treatment of viral pneumonia from 2015 to 2025. The search term was TS=((""Viral pneumonia"" OR ""Respiratory syncytial virus"" OR ""Influenza virus"" OR ""Rhinovirus"") AND (""Chinese traditional medicine"" OR ""Traditional Chinese medicine"" OR ""TCM"" OR ""Chinese herbal medicine"")). The VOSviewer (V1.6.20) and CiteSpace (V6.3.R1) visualization tools were used to analyze elements such as countries, institutions, journals, authors, references, and keywords, in order to predict the research trends of TCM in the treatment of viral pneumonia."; A total of 209 English publications were included. From June 2015 to June 2025, the publication rate of literature in this field showed an upward trend, with a particularly rapid increase from 2020 to 2025. China and its TCM universities have made significant progress in this field. The most studied viral pneumonia is caused by influenza and respiratory syncytial virus. The current research hotspots are verifying the effects of TCM in reducing viral replication and inflammatory factor production through in vitro and in vivo experiments. The research trend is shifting from compound TCM preparations to the screening of effective components using network pharmacology and molecular docking techniques, and the targets are moving from inflammatory factors to immune cells. In addition, the development of research on the lung-intestine axis, intestinal flora, and their metabolites provides new ideas for TCM in the treatment of viral pneumonia and is expected to bring more effective treatment options.; This study comprehensively reviews the research frontiers of TCM in the treatment of viral pneumonia. In-depth exploration of the role of TCM in the lung-intestine axis may provide valuable references for the scientific research and clinical practice of treating viral pneumonia.;"Traditional Chinese Medicine; Viral Pneumonia; Bibliometrics"

Despite increasing awareness, mental health care systems often fell short in terms of accessibility, effectiveness, and long-term outcomes. The dominant biomedical model showed notable limitations, including over-reliance on medication, which often leads to significant side effects, especially in the long term, alongside high relapse rates and treatment resistance. In response, integrative mental health care has emerged as a promising framework based on whole-person, personalized, collaborative, and evidence-based care. 
Traditional, Complementary, and Integrative Healthcare (TCIH) systems offer a wide range of modalities and theoretical perspectives that align with this framework, yet their potential remains underexplored. This narrative review aimed to assess the contribution of TCIH to mental health care by synthesizing diverse sources of evidence, highlighting opportunities, challenges, and suggested future directions.";??We conducted a narrative review of peer-reviewed literature, including RCTs, systematic reviews and meta-analyses, as well as grey literature, and other relevant publications. Literature was sourced through two complementary search strategies. We conducted a broad search for conceptual, theoretical, and policy-related sources on TCIH and mental health. In parallel, we conducted targeted searches in databases like PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library, cross-referencing TCIH modalities with mental health terms to identify relevant empirical studies. Sources that met inclusion criteria and passed exclusion screening were categorized to support a structured and multidimensional synthesis of findings.;"Emerging themes suggested that several TCIH modalities, including mindfulness, traditional Chinese medicine, yoga, nature-based therapies, and Indigenous healing practices, hold promise for addressing mental conditions such as depression, anxiety, and trauma, as well as promoting resilience and well-being. The contribution of each modality was examined through theoretical, psychiatric, social, and neurobiological perspectives, based on available literature. Although evidence levels varied, initial findings highlighted the value of TCIH both as stand-alone and as complements to standard treatments.

The review also discusses key challenges, gaps, and opportunities in integrating TCIH into mental health care systems. At the research level, while modalities such as mindfulness and acupuncture have received growing research attention, many TCIH modalities remain understudied due to research prioritizing, funding and methodological limitations. The review calls for novel, interdisciplinary, and context-sensitive methodologies, including the use of digital tools and AI-assisted data synthesis, to better reflect the complexity and nuance of TCIH interventions in the mental health field. At the systemic level, barriers include professional skepticism, regulatory inconsistencies, limited insurance coverage, and insufficient inclusion of TCIH in education and policy. Nonetheless, the review highlights clear opportunities: adopting inclusive research methods, fostering interprofessional collaboration, and integrating TCIH into clinical guidelines, training programs, and public health strategies - to expand the accessible, cost-effective, and culturally informed support that TCIH can provide for mental health, especially within community care.";This review is ongoing, with detailed findings to follow. Initial analysis suggests growing evidence supporting TCIH contribution across mental health conditions. Further research is needed to map these contributions and guide policy toward more holistic, sustainable models of mental health care.;"mental health; Mental Disorders; Physical and mental well-being; evidence based information; Traditional Complementary and Integrative Medicine"

In this context, self-compassion has emerged as a protective psychological resource, with potential to mitigate the negative effects associated with caregiving.Objective: To identify interventions with the potential to enhance self-compassion among family caregivers of people with dementia.;A scoping review was conducted across eight electronic databases: PubMed, BVS, EMBASE, ProQuest, PsycINFO, LILACS, ERIC, and CINAHL. The search strategy included the following descriptors: dementia, self-compassion, empathy, family, caregivers, and mental health. Studies published in English that addressed mindfulness-based and/or compassion-based interventions were included. Rayyan software was used to assist in the screening and selection phases.;The search identified 280 articles, of which six met the inclusion criteria. The interventions involved Yoga, Mindfulness, Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), Self-compassion-based Therapy, and Mentalization. The studies indicated improvements in emotional well-being, grief, interpersonal relationships, anxiety, acceptance, and quality of life. However, only three of the six studies reported an increase in self-compassion levels among participants.;The literature highlights the potential of certain mindfulness- and compassion-based interventions to promote self-compassion among caregivers of people with dementia.;"dementia; caregivers; self-compassion; scoping review"

Therefore, essential oils may be a promising artifact in relation to the treatment of wounds, since the treatment of infections and inflammations are still important issues. The objective of this study was to investigate the evidence available in the literature on the effect of the topical use of essential oils on wound healing in humans.;The protocol for this review was developed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review Protocols and is registered in the PROSPERO database under code CRD42021269456. This is a systematic review whose search for articles was carried out on November 17, 2021 in databases, in addition to gray literature, manual search and consultation with researchers. In order to enable updating the review, the bibliographic search was updated in January 2025, but no new studies that met the guiding question were retrieved. No limits were established regarding the year of publication or language of the articles. Randomized clinical trials and non-randomized clinical trials with intervention and comparator groups were included in this review. Two reviewers participated in the selection and critical evaluation of the studies independently. The quality of evidence was analyzed using instruments proposed by the Joanna Briggs Institute and the risk of bias assessment for randomized studies was performed using the RoB-2.0 tool, to evaluate studies without randomization the ROBINS-I tool was used.;Thirteen studies were included in this review, eight randomized clinical trials and five non-randomized clinical trials. The most predominant type of wound treated was episiotomy, and lavender essential oil was the most used in the intervention group of the included studies. The data from this review were presented through descriptive analysis and narrative synthesis, according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses. Meta-analysis was not possible considering the clinical and methodological heterogeneity of the studies. The included studies demonstrate that there is interest in the topical use of essential oils in wound treatment as a low-cost and accessible alternative for patients and health professionals, especially lavender and tea tree essential oil. However, routine clinical use still depends on studies with better design and methodological rigor.;Although a meta-analysis was not feasible due to the significant clinical and methodological heterogeneity of the studies, the descriptive analysis suggests a growing interest in the use of essential oils for wound healing, particularly lavender oil. However, current evidence is limited. Most of the included studies that used lavender oil had a high risk of bias or low methodological rigor, which prevents the routine recommendation of these treatments in clinical practice. For essential oils to be considered a viable alternative, further research is needed, such as randomized clinical trials, representative samples, and details on the species, concentration, dose, and origin of the oil, to assess the benefits of their use compared to conventional therapies standardized by healthcare institutions and services.;"volatile oils; wounds and injuries; healing; Systematic Review"

Hypnosis is also increasingly promoted as a response to a wide range of psychological issues, including addiction, eating disorders, stress, anxiety, and insomnia. Nevertheless, its position within the French healthcare system remains tenuous, as there is an absence of a legal framework to regulate its practice.

The Hyp-Hope project “Healing through Hypnosis: Therapeutic Promises and Transformations of Health Practices” (coordinated by B. Hauray) seeks to investigate this development. Funded by the French National Research Agency (2024-2027), the project brings together three research centers and ten researchers in sociology, anthropology, and psychology.";"This paper draws on qualitative data collected by the author as part of the Hyp-Hope project. It is based on:
a) 18 interviews with professionals using hypnosis in their therapeutic work, some of whom have played pivotal roles in the development of therapeutic hypnosis in France;
b) observations of chronic pain hypnosis consultations (7 half-days) and chronic pain self-management workshops (5 half-days) conducted in three different French hospitals; and
c) data collected through the author’s participation in three training workshops in therapeutic hypnosis designed for healthcare professionals (8 days).";"This paper will first offer an analysis of the development of therapeutic hypnosis in France. It will highlight the key role played by a growing market for hypnosis training, which has progressively opened up to non-medical practitioners. It will show how the expansion of hypnosis for both pain management/sedation, on the one hand,  and psychological issues, on the other hand, has been shaped by mutually reinforcing dynamics of credibility-building and public visibility. It will explore the tensions that this plural expansion generates among healthcare professionals, as well as between medical and non-medical hypnotherapists.

Second, the paper will examine the trajectories of healthcare professionals (psychiatrists, general practitioners, nurses, anaesthesiologists, psychologists, dentists) who have chosen to incorporate hypnosis into their practice. It will analyse how hypnosis has allowed them to re-center the caregiver–patient relationship within the therapeutic process and to engage more effectively with the subjective dimension of care.

Third, the paper will focus on the case of chronic pain to more precisely analyze how hypnosis may contribute to the definition of new therapeutic practices. It will argue that hypnosis is presented as a particularly appropriate response to the complex nature of chronic pain—encompassing physiological, psychological, social, and existential dimensions. It will show that hypnotherapy primarily aims to help patients break out of immobility, regain a sense of agency, and reconfigure their relationship to pain, both through the therapeutic alliance and the development of self-hypnosis techniques.";"The project Hyp-hope aims to contributes to three cross-cutting areas of inquiry: (a) mind–body relations in medicine and healthcare; (b) the place of non-conventional medicine in France; and (c) the interplay between (de)medicalization and (de) pathologization at the intersection of health and well-being.";"Hypnosis; Sociology; France; Chronic Pain"

Studies have demonstrated its potential as a complementary approach in the management of emotional disorders, such as Common Mental Disorders (CMDs)—conditions that are increasingly affecting populations worldwide. This cross-sectional study aimed to investigate the impact of acupuncture on reducing depressive symptoms, improving quality of life, and modulating oxidative stress in university students. ;The study was approved by the ethics committee under opinion no. 6.731.546/2024, and all participants signed an Informed Consent Form. The sample consisted of 28 participants, selected by convenience, who underwent ten acupuncture sessions. Before and after the intervention, participants completed sociodemographic questionnaires, the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21), and the Short Form Health Survey (SF-36). They also underwent energetic assessment using the Ryodoraku method and blood collection for analysis of oxidative stress markers. The acupuncture points used were: GV20 and Yin Tang (central, single points), and PC6, HT7, LR3, and SP6 (bilateral points). All data were statistically analyzed to assess the impact of acupuncture treatment on the measured variables. ;"Most participants were female, single, aged up to 28 years, lived with family, reported weekly alcohol consumption, stress, and dissatisfaction with leisure time. After the intervention, reductions were observed in depression (from 67.85% to 39.28%; p = 0.039), anxiety (75% to 50%; p = 0.039), and stress (82.14% to 50%; p = 0.012) according to the DASS-21. The SF-36 showed significant improvements in the domains of “general health status” (from 54.46 to 61.14; p = 0.010), “vitality” (36.43 to 46.25; p = 0.003), “emotional aspects” (27.38 to 45.24; p = 0.041), and “mental health” (51.86 to 60.43; p = 0.004). Ryodoraku analysis indicated improvements in all evaluated meridians, although without statistically significant differences. Regarding oxidative stress, an increase in protein thiol (P-SH) levels was observed (from 2.69 to 4.16 nmol/mL), as well as a reduction in thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) (from 13.9 to 9.31 nmol/mL), suggesting improvement in antioxidant status after treatment. ";The results indicate that acupuncture was effective in reducing depressive symptoms, with positive effects also on anxiety and stress, while contributing to improved quality of life and modulation of oxidative stress. However, interpretation of these findings should consider the limitations of the cross-sectional design. Therefore, the results suggest that acupuncture is a promising complementary health care intervention for university students’ mental health, with benefits associated with redox balance, although further randomized controlled trials with larger populations are needed to better understand these effects.;"mental health; Medicine; Chinese Traditional; Biomarkers"

Well-being promotion practices, such as mindfulness meditation, are aligned with WHO guidelines. The MBRP-Ser protocol, initially delivered in person over eight weekly 90-minute sessions, has been expanded to online formats with greater reach. However, comparative studies between these modalities have not yet been conducted.
OBJECTIVE: To compare preliminary outcomes of the MBRP-Ser protocol in in-person and online modalities within a university community.";MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a clinical study with a convenience sample in either in-person (n=21) or online (n=29) formats. The study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee at UNIFESP (CAAE 76954923.2.0000.5505). Mental health indicators, mindfulness levels, and self-compassion were analyzed. Repeated measures ANOVA was used to compare pre- and post-intervention results between groups, with a significance level of 5% (p-value < 0.05).;"The mean age of participants was 32.2 years, with a predominance of women (77.5%), single (62.5%), White (62.5%), with incomplete higher education (50%), and a family income between 2 and 4 minimum wages (35%). When comparing the mindfulness scale (FFMQ-SF), participants in both groups showed a significant increase in the total score (p = 0.0094) at the post-intervention time point in the in-person group (M = 3.42; SD = 0.38) and online group (M = 3.53; SD = 0.63), compared to pre-intervention in-person (M = 3.14; SD = 0.43) and online (M = 3.15; SD = 0.59).One of the FFMQ-SF facets, acting mindfully, also showed a significant increase (p = 0.0233) when comparing pre-intervention scores in the in-person (M = 2.87; SD = 0.76) and online (M = 2.88; SD = 1.25) groups with post-intervention in-person (M = 3.56; SD = 0.52) and online (M = 3.33; SD = 1.21).The total self-compassion score (SCS) also increased significantly (p = 0.0053), when contrasting pre-intervention in-person (M = 2.71; SD = 0.93) and online (M = 3.41; SD = 0.51) with post-intervention in-person (M = 3.16; SD = 0.73) and online (M = 3.72; SD = 0.66). Two SCS subscales—common humanity and isolation—also showed significant changes over time. Common humanity increased (p = 0.0324) while isolation decreased (p = 0.0111). A reduction in anxiety (HADS) was also observed in both groups (p = 0.0336), when comparing pre-intervention in-person (M = 9.78; SD = 6.16) and online (M = 6.64; SD = 3.85) with post-intervention in-person (M = 7.44; SD = 3.61) and online (M = 6.00; SD = 4.10). Improvements were also noted in depressive symptoms and insomnia, although not statistically significant.";CONCLUSION: This pilot study suggests that the SER protocol contributed to increased mindfulness levels, reduced anxiety symptoms, and enhanced self-compassion in both in-person and online groups, demonstrating its potential for health promotion with similar outcomes across both modalities.;"Mindfulness; Internet-Based Intervention; mental health"

Studies have demonstrated its potential as a complementary approach in the management of emotional disorders, such as Common Mental Disorders (CMDs)—conditions that are increasingly affecting populations worldwide. This cross-sectional study aimed to evaluate the impact of auriculotherapy on improving symptoms related to CMDs in the population of Southwest Paraná, Brazil.;The study was approved by the ethics committee under opinion no. 6.275.792/2023, and all participants signed an informed consent form. The sample consisted of 297 participants, selected by convenience, who underwent eight sessions of auriculotherapy. Before and after the treatment, participants completed a sociodemographic questionnaire, the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21), the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10), and underwent an energy assessment using the Ryodoraku method. In a subgroup of 115 patients, blood samples were collected by venipuncture before and after the treatment to measure basal cortisol levels and oxidative stress markers (vitamin C, protein thiols – P-SH, and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances – TBARS). Auriculotherapy was applied to the Shen Men, Kidney, Autonomic Nervous System, Liver, Spleen-Pancreas, Heart, Anxiety, and San Jiao points. All data were subjected to statistical analysis to assess the impact of the treatment on the evaluated variables.;"Approximately 54% of participants were female, aged between 18 and 30 years. Regarding the DASS-21 results, 65.16% of patients were classified within the normal range for depression before treatment, increasing to 80.31% after treatment (p=0.01); for anxiety, 58.43% were within the normal range before, and 71.35% after (p=0.01); and for stress, 74.21% were normal before, rising to 87.64% after treatment (p=0.01). The PSS-10 results indicated a reduction in perceived stress levels from 22.59 to 18.80 (p=0.01). Ryodoraku analysis showed improvement in all meridians evaluated after treatment, although without statistically significant differences. Regarding cortisol, 13.04% of patients had levels outside the reference values before treatment, decreasing to 6.09% afterward (p=0.01). As for oxidative stress, significant differences were observed in P-SH levels, which increased from 2.28 to 3.78 nmol/mL (p<0.001), and in TBARS levels, which decreased from 5.96 to 2.92 nmol/mL (p<0.001), suggesting improvement in the antioxidant profile after treatment.";Improvement was observed in all variables related to CMDs, as well as in cortisol levels and oxidative stress markers, indicating increased antioxidant activity and reduced production of oxidants following auriculotherapy treatment. The evidence suggests that auriculotherapy may represent a promising complementary care strategy for promoting mental health, with benefits associated with redox balance and regulation of cortisol levels.;"mental health; Medicine; Chinese Traditional; Biomarkers"

In public health, the nurse is an active agent in Primary Care, who can use traditional medicine as a strategy for prevention, promotion and health protection. However, the provision of therapies in Basic Health Units (UBS) is related to the knowledge of the professional, which implies their attitudes and practices. By promoting care with alternative therapies, the nurse corroborates the doctrinal principle of integrality and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the 2030 Agenda. Therefore, the objective is to investigate the scientific literature on the knowledge, attitudes and practices of nurses in relation to PICS in primary health care. ;"This is an integrative review that was developed in four stages, through a survey of publications from November to December 2024 in the Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online (MEDLINE/PubMed) database. The following inclusion criteria were considered: 
the object of study must be related to the KAP survey, mention some KAP performed by a nursing professional, and be available in full and free of charge in electronic format.";"This review suggested a scarcity of studies that address KAP focusing on the KAP method, since of the 90 articles found, only 9 
answered the guiding question and most were not available in full and free of charge. Four articles were analyzed, two from Brazil, one from Italy and one from Australia. They indicated that although nurses have some knowledge about alternative therapies, they do not feel confident to develop these practices and associate this with a lack of scientific knowledge about PICS, management support and implementation of regulations. ";Final Considerations: The articles suggest that nurses' attitudes and practices are related to their knowledge about alternative medicine, and show the need to strengthen continuing education in health organizations, to promote PICS training for professionals, in addition to greater interaction between management and care.;"Complementary Therapies; Health Knowledge Attitudes Practice; Primary Care Nursing; "

The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of Fangfeng Tongsheng Pill combined with normal rat colony transplantation on the ""intestinal flora-SCFAs-GPR43-gastrointestinal peptide"" pathway in obese rats.";"After the obese rat model was successfully established through high-fat diet feeding, the rats were randomly divided into the following groups: Normal Control Group (NC), Obesity Model Group (M), Normal Flora Transplantation Group (FMT), Fangfeng Tongsheng Pill Group (FFTS), Combined Normal Flora and Fangfeng Tongsheng Pill Group (LH), and Microecological Preparation Medilac-Vita Group (MMA). Following induction of pseudo-germ-free conditions in rats via antibiotic solution gavage, treatments including normal flora transplantation, Fangfeng Tongsheng Pill administration, combined normal flora and Fangfeng Tongsheng Pill treatment, and Medilac-Vita supplementation were administered according to group assignments. High-throughput sequencing was employed to analyze changes in gut microbiota composition; gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was utilized to quantify acetic acid, propionic acid, and butyric acid levels among short-chain fatty acids; immunohistochemistry was performed to evaluate GPR43 expression in liver tissues; enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was conducted to measure gastrointestinal peptide concentrations in rat serum; and an automatic biochemical analyzer was used to assess cholesterol and triglyceride levels in serum.";At the phylum level, the LH group had significantly lower Aspergillus (P < 0.05) but higher Desulfovibrio (P < 0.05). At the family level, Escherichiaceae and Streptococcus pepticus decreased (P < 0.05), while Rumatobacterium and Trematobacterium increased (P < 0.05). Acetic, propionic, and butyric acid levels were significantly higher in the LH group than in the FFTS and FMT groups. GPR43 was detected in all liver tissues, with lower expression in group M versus NC (P < 0.05). GLP-1 levels rose significantly in the LH, MMA, FMT, and FFTS groups compared to M (P < 0.05) but were lower in MMA, FMT, and FFTS versus LH (P < 0.05). PYY levels were higher in LH, MMA, FMT, and FFTS than in M (P < 0.05), though MMA had lower PYY than LH (P < 0.05), while FMT and FFTS showed elevated levels (P < 0.05). MTL levels in M, MMA, NC, and LH exceeded those in FFTS and FMT (P < 0.05). GAS levels in NC, LH, and MMA were higher than in FMT and FFTS (P < 0.05). Serum TG in the M group was significantly higher than in NC (P < 0.05), whereas the LH group had lower TG than M (P < 0.05).;Normal flora transplantation, Fangfeng Tongsheng Pill (FFT), fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) combined with FFT, and the microecological agent Medilac-Vita exert protective effects against high-fat diet-induced obesity in rats by modulating the“intestinal microbiota–SCFAs–GPR43–gastrointestinal peptide” axis. Notably, the combination of FFT and FMT demonstrates a synergistic effect, offering superior therapeutic advantages. These findings offer a new approach to combining traditional Chinese medicine with local microbiota regulation for the treatment of obese patients.;"obesity; intestinal flora; flora transplantation; Fangfeng Tongsheng Pill; SCFAs-GPR43-gastrointestinal peptides"

Approximately 50% of RA patients experience chronic pain, which limits physical function, increases disease activity, and predisposes them to psychological problems such as anxiety and depression, thereby reducing quality of life and increasing socioeconomic burdens. As a complementary and alternative medicine, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has fewer side effects than conventional Western medicine and can improve quality of life of patients. This evidence summary summarizes all TCM therapies for RA patients in the last five years to instruct the clinical practice. The process of generating different levels of evidence and applying them to clinical practice always involves a lengthy period of time, therefore, it is also the necessary step before evidence translation.;A top-down search of relevant literature was conducted according to the “6S” evidence model, including clinical decisions, guidelines, best practices, evidence summaries, expert consensus, and systematic reviews. The literature was evaluated, and evidence was extracted independently by two researchers. The evidence was appraised using the corresponding quality appraisal tools and integrated with an evidence-based team consisting of five members.;Forty-seven publications were included, including one clinical decision, three guidelines, four expert consensus, one evidence summary, thirty-seven systematic reviews. Twenty-two items of best evidence were summarized from seven areas: Traditional Chinese Medicine/Chinese Herbal Medicine, Chinese Patent Medicine, Traditional Chinese Medicine Decoction, Manual Therapy (acupuncture, moxibustion etc.) , TCM External Intervention, Therapeutic Exercises, and Integrative traditional Chinese and Western medicine. TCM Herbs are used across RA stages (prevention, active, late) to alleviate symptoms, reduce progression, and regulate bone metabolism. In Chinese patent medicines, some specific formulas (e.g., Biqi, Wangbi, Kunxian Capsules) target different RA patterns to improve symptoms, lab markers, and QoL, but require attention to contraindications and adverse reactions. Many TCM Decoctions (e.g., Simiao Xiaobi, Wutou, Guizhi Shaoyao Zhimu) prescribed based on RA patterns significantly improve symptoms and lab markers, often with fewer adverse events. Manual therapies like acupuncture (various types), moxibustion, and massage effectively reduce pain, inflammation, and disease activity, especially when combined with other treatments. TCM Fumigation, wax therapy, and external applications improve efficacy and safety, often outperforming Western medicine alone in some metrics. While therapeutic exercises: like Tai Chi/Qigong are conditionally recommended to maintain engagement and physical function. Combining TCM (herbs, decoctions, patent meds, acupuncture, extracts) with Western DMARDs consistently shows superior efficacy in improving symptoms, lab markers, and reducing disease activity/side effects compared to either alone.;This review summarizes the best evidence for TCM interventions for patients with RA, which can be used by clinical healthcare professionals to have various TCM choices to address symptoms induced by RA. Subsequently, the findings of this study will serve as the source of content for the rapid recommendation of TCM (a knowledge transformation product), for evidence transformation, which will be beneficial in bridging the gap between evidence and practice.;"evidence summary; Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM); rheumatoid arthritis; evidence tranlation; evidence-based practice"

(VA) is a semiparasitic plant from the Santalaceae family widely used in complementary cancer therapy. Commercial aqueous VA extracts are available for subcutaneous administration, but this route is not ideal for pediatric patients and is often associated with discomfort. In this context, this study aimed to develop and characterize PLA/Pluronic® F127 (PF127) nanofibers containing an ethanolic extract of Abies alba VA, being a less invasive and controlled-release alternative.;Core-shell nanofibers were produced by electrospinning, varying PF127 concentrations (2.5%, 5%, and 10% w/v) while maintaining PLA at 15% w/v and VA 2.5% w/v. Morphological characterization was performed using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), with gold-coated samples analyzed at 10–15 kV and 5000× magnification. Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) evaluated internal fiber structure and drug dispersion.;SEM images confirmed the successful formation of nanofibers under all tested conditions. Variations in PF127 concentration affected fiber diameter. Shapiro-Wilk normality test indicated that the data did not follow a normal distribution (p<0.05). Kruskal-Wallis test revealed significant differences between the groups (p<0.05), confirming the influence of PF127 concentration on morphology. Dunn’s post-hoc test showed no statistically significant difference between the 2.5% and 10% PF127 concentrations, both yielding the smallest fiber diameters. TEM analysis indicated better drug dispersion at 10%, guiding its selection for further studies. ;PF127 concentration plays a crucial role in nanofiber morphology and drug dispersion. The 10% formulation showed the best characteristics and was selected for further biological evaluation. Future experiments will investigate cytotoxicity against normal and cancer cells and healing properties through fibroblast and keratinocyte wound-healing assays. These studies aim to investigate the efficacy and safety of the developed system for biomedical applications.;"Nanofibers; Viscum album; electrospinning; drug delivery; cancer therapy"

This study addresses the implementation of an interprofessional team (physician, pharmacist, physiotherapist, nutritionist, and art therapist) to provide comprehensive care to people with chronic pain in 2024, in Secondary Health Care at the Regional Specialty Center of the municipality of São Mateus (CRESM), in northern Espírito Santo. Art therapy was used to support care and promote self-care for mental health and well-being.;"This is a pilot study with a qualitative approach. Inclusion criteria: adult patients diagnosed with chronic pain treated at CRESM, of any race/color, ethnicity, or gender. Patients with cancer pain, functional dependence, or cognitive impairment that would hinder understanding of the guidelines were excluded. The sample (89% female; 75% with low education; and unfavorable socioeconomic conditions) was a convenience sample, considering spontaneous demand for the service. Referrals for art therapy were made by a medical professional, based on a clinical mental health assessment. In the first week of each group, an initial interview was conducted to collect sociodemographic and clinical data. Pain and quality of life were assessed using the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) and the Visual Analog Scale (VAS). Twenty-two patients were followed weekly in groups of up to 12 participants for 16 weeks. Each weekly session lasted two and a half hours and presented an expressive and creative approach using various artistic languages (visual arts, photography, music, dance, and theater). At the end of each session, participants shared their experiences of the creative process and their perceptions of their artwork. The art therapist recorded each session in a logbook, which was then used for content analysis. In the final week of the group, participants were assessed through a new interview to reapply the instruments used in the pre-intervention phase. The team conducted biweekly clinical conversations. Capturing and recording participants' subjectivities in the sessions was one of the limitations of this study.";"In these groups, CP, initially measured by the Visual Analgesic Scale (0-10), ranged from moderate (3-7, 23%) to severe (7-10, 71%), and was associated with poor quality of life, work absences, high treatment costs, impact on quality of life, negatively affecting relationships and self-esteem; unfavorable socioeconomic conditions; and professional activities requiring intense physical effort. The expressive activities proposed in the therapeutic groups helped control pain (final CP measurement by the Visual Analgesic Scale ranged from moderate - 83%; severe 17%) and strengthened self-esteem, facilitating the integration of feelings, emotions, and affections.";Our preliminary results demonstrate that art therapy is replicable and can be useful for professionals working with people living with chronic pain. The results included positive changes in cognitive and affective functioning, social support, stress levels, psychological processing, pain experiences, and self-representations. These results suggest the relevance of expressive and creative practices in art therapy experiences for the care and self-care of people with chronic pain.;"art therapy; Chronic Pain; Psychological Distress; mental health; multidisciplinary team"

Inadequate sleep negatively affects quality of life, contributing to fatigue, socioeconomic burdens, and behavioral disturbances. Although pharmacological treatments are available for sleep disorders, many individuals still report poor sleep quality. As a result, integrative practices such as auriculotherapy have gained traction in managing sleep disturbances. By stimulating specific points on the ear, this technique promotes physiological balance and supports the treatment of conditions like insomnia. Although recent studies suggest promising results, further rigorous research is necessary to establish clinical guidelines. This study aimed to assess the effects of auriculotherapy on sleep quality in adults.;The study was conducted at a higher education institution offering various health-related programs and involved 33 adults with self-reported poor sleep quality, selected through convenience sampling. Inclusion criteria included age ?18 years and a Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score of ?5. Exclusion criteria included auricular contraindications, pregnancy, breastfeeding, or previous auriculotherapy within the past three months. A trained professional administered the intervention, which consisted of five weekly sessions, with alternating application on each auricle. Mustard seeds were applied to the Shenmen, Kidney, Sympathetic, Subcortex, Occipital, Endocrine, Liver, Spleen, and Anterior Lobe points. Participants were instructed to apply moderate manual pressure to the points three times per day. Sleep quality was assessed pre- and post-intervention using the PSQI, and data were analyzed with the Wilcoxon signed-rank test, adopting a 5% significance level. The study received ethical approval from the Research Ethics Committee.;The sample was mostly composed of single, Catholic women with a monthly income below the minimum wage. A statistically significant improvement was observed in both subjective sleep quality and sleep duration following auriculotherapy (p < 0.05). The results indicate that, based on the adopted protocol, auriculotherapy contributed to improved sleep quality and increased sleep time, demonstrating its potential as a complementary intervention.;Auriculotherapy appears to improve sleep quality in adults, contributing to increased sleep duration. However, further randomized clinical trials are needed to strengthen the evidence base regarding its effectiveness.;"Auriculotherapy; Sleep; sleep quality; Adult; Complementary Therapies"

Extract for Cancer Therapy;Viscum album L. (VA) is a semiparasitic plant belonging to the Santalaceae family, whose chemical composition varies according to the season. It has been widely used in complementary medicine, particularly in the treatment of various types of cancer. Prostate cancer is currently the second most common cancer among men worldwide, while cervical cancer remains the fourth leading cause of cancer-related deaths among women. In this context, local drug administration via rectal and vaginal routes offers significant advantages due to the high vascularization of these mucosal tissues, which favors rapid and efficient absorption of active compounds. Additionally, these routes bypass first-pass hepatic metabolism, allowing for targeted delivery to the affected tissue. ;This study aimed to develop a promising alternative for the local treatment of prostate and cervical cancer by formulating suppositories and vaginal ovules containing Viscum album tincture, extracted from two different host trees: Abies alba and Malus domestica. The choice of administration routes and dosage forms was intended to leverage both the therapeutic potential of VA and the pharmacokinetic benefits of mucosal delivery. Natural waxes and butters were selected as excipients due to their melting points close to body temperature, providing an ideal dispersion medium while offering moisturizing and antioxidant properties attributed to vitamins A and E. Additionally, these excipients have antifungal properties, contributing to the safety and stability of the formulations. ;As part of the initial characterization, the formulations underwent Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy analysis. The spectra revealed characteristic bands of vegetable oils and butters, notably methylene stretching (CH?) at 2915 cm?¹ and 2850 cm?¹, ester carbonyl (C=O) stretching at 1745 cm?¹, and C–O–C stretching at 1158 cm?¹. An additional band at 3009 cm?¹ was identified in some formulations, indicating unsaturation in fatty acids, while a band at 3430 cm?¹—observed in samples with higher butter content—was attributed to hydroxyl (O–H) stretching, likely related to residual moisture or polar compounds. No signs of degradation of the active compounds or lipid bases were detected, indicating the chemical stability of the formulations during the preparation process. ;The results indicate that the incorporation of VA tincture into suppositories and vaginal ovules is a viable and potentially effective strategy for the local treatment of prostate and cervical cancers, respectively. This approach offers promising perspectives for less invasive therapies with higher concentrations of active compounds at the target site. Further studies are warranted to advance this research and evaluate clinical applicability.;"Viscum album; cancer therapy; Vaginal Ovules; Suppositories"

Studies suggest that up to 45–60% of patients with unexplained chronic complaints may have clinically relevant IgG-mediated reactions to common foods. Unlike IgE-mediated allergies, which elicit immediate responses, IgG-mediated reactions are delayed, often subclinical, and may contribute to chronic low-grade inflammation. In a randomized controlled trial, Atkinson et al. (2004) demonstrated significant symptom reduction in patients with irritable bowel syndrome following an IgG-based elimination diet. The growing field of integrative and precision medicine increasingly supports the use of food-specific IgG testing to guide personalized dietary interventions. The ImuPro test, based on standardized ELISA technology, quantifies IgG antibodies against over 270 food antigens, allowing the identification of delayed hypersensitivities with potential clinical impact. This study aims to evaluate the outcomes of patients undergoing personalized elimination or rotational diets based on ImuPro results, assessing symptom improvements across gastrointestinal, dermatological, cognitive, and metabolic domains.;This retrospective observational study analyzed clinical survey data from 33 patients who completed the ImuPro test and adhered to dietary changes. Participants answered a structured questionnaire assessing pre-test symptoms, dietary adherence, perceived improvements, and time to clinical response. Data were analyzed descriptively to identify patterns in symptom relief and patient experience.;"The most common symptoms reported before testing were gastrointestinal disturbances, such as constipation, bloating, and diarrhea, followed by autoimmune-related symptoms and difficulty losing weight. 81.8% of patients reported a 'significant improvement' in symptoms after dietary adjustments. The mean global improvement score (scale 1–10) was 8.7. 42% of patients noticed improvements within 7–14 days, while 24% required 14–28 days. 33% (11 patients) reported unintentional weight loss, with reductions ranging from 3 to 7.6 kg, mostly over 2–5 months.
Adherence to the elimination or rotational diet was reported as moderate to high by the majority, with some difficulty reported in removing staple foods like eggs and dairy.";The results of this observational study suggest that a personalized dietary intervention based on IgG food hypersensitivity testing may lead to significant clinical improvements in patients with chronic, nonspecific symptoms. Symptom relief was reported in gastrointestinal, dermatological, cognitive, and metabolic domains, reinforcing the relevance of identifying delayed food hypersensitivities in clinical practice. The ImuPro test proved to be a valuable tool in guiding individualized nutritional strategies, especially in cases where conventional diagnostics fail to identify underlying triggers. Incorporating IgG-based testing into integrative medicine protocols may enhance diagnostic precision, support patient-centered care, and reduce long-term symptom burden through targeted dietary modifications. Further prospective studies are warranted to strengthen the evidence base and broaden clinical applications.;"IgG food hypersensitivity; Chronic inflammation; gastrointestinal discomfort; weight-loss; ImuPro"

Iranian Traditional Medicine (ITM), with over a millennium of documented theory and clinical practice, is a rich example of such systems. This study aims to: (1) explore the global diversity of TCIM through the model of ITM, (2) examine strategies for integrating ITM into contemporary healthcare systems, and (3) analyze ITM’s contributions to global health across the lifespan, from child health to palliative care, with attention to public health, education, and planetary well-being.;The research uses a qualitative-interpretive design, combining literature review, policy analysis, and expert interviews with physicians, educators, and policymakers in Iran’s health system. Data sources include clinical case studies, WHO reports on TCIM, Iranian national health plans, and educational curricula in medical universities.;"Clinical Practice:
Iranian Traditional Medicine (ITM) is rooted in humoral theory and the concept of Mizaj (temperament), guiding individualized diagnosis and care. Hifz al-Sihha (health preservation) is central, promoting preventive practices—balanced diet, quality sleep, emotional balance, and seasonal adaptation. These measures aid in managing chronic conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, anxiety, and cancer-related fatigue, complementing modern medicine.

Education:
Seventeen Iranian medical universities offer postgraduate ITM programs (PhD and residency), officially approved by the Ministry of Health as part of the National ITM Development Plan. These programs combine classical texts with biomedical sciences. Over 1,000 general practitioners have completed certified training. Some universities also include ITM in general medical education, reflecting its formal integration into the national health and education systems.

Public Policy and Integration:
Since 2006, Iran’s Ministry of Health has officially recognized ITM within the national healthcare system. A National ITM Development Plan promotes capacity building, research, and service delivery. ITM is now offered in over 120 public clinics and hospitals, supported by regulations, practitioner licensing, and herbal medicine oversight. Public education campaigns promote safe use. Although insurance remains limited, reforms aim to expand coverage. Iran’s model aligns with WHO’s traditional medicine strategies.";Iranian Traditional Medicine, through its formal recognition, national policy framework, and progressive integration into healthcare delivery, represents a unique model of traditional medicine modernization. This system not only preserves cultural heritage but also supports sustainability, patient empowerment, and holistic care. Its successful incorporation into public health infrastructures illustrates how TCIM can coexist with biomedicine to enhance outcomes. Future growth requires greater international collaboration, policy innovation, and investments in clinical evidence, ensuring ITM’s contributions to global and planetary health are fully realized.;"Iranian Traditional Medicine; TCIM; Integrative Healthcare"

Traditional Persian Medicine (TPM) represents a rich and diverse medical heritage, shaped by eminent physicians such as Avicenna (Ibn Sina) and Rhazes (al-Razi). Among the therapeutic modalities in TPM, manual therapies—particularly Hijama (wet cupping), Dalak (massage), and other A‘mal-e-Yadavi (manual procedures)—hold a distinctive place. This study explores the theoretical foundations, clinical applications, and historical continuity of these practices in the context of classical TPM.";A narrative and conceptual review methodology was adopted. Primary sources including The Canon of Medicine (Avicenna) and Kitab al-Hawi (Rhazes) were analyzed, supplemented with contemporary academic interpretations. Manual therapy practices were categorized based on their intended use (preventive, curative, detoxifying) and physiological mechanisms. Preliminary ethnomedical data from current TPM practitioners in Iran were also reviewed to assess continuity and variation in application.;Avicenna emphasized the humoral balance as a cornerstone of health, recommending massage for improving circulation and nervous balance, while Rhazes advocated for cupping to eliminate morbid humors and stimulate immune response. Both scholars provided systematic guidelines on technique, timing, and contraindications. Today, these modalities continue to be practiced across Iran and neighboring regions, with increasing interest in their integration into complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) globally. Early clinical observations suggest potential benefits in musculoskeletal, neurological, and psychosomatic disorders, though rigorous evidence is still evolving.;The insights of Avicenna and Rhazes on manual therapies highlight the intellectual sophistication and therapeutic diversity within TPM. These practices represent not only historical relevance but also potential contributions to global health through integrative care. Further interdisciplinary research is warranted to validate and adapt these approaches within contemporary medical frameworks.;"Traditional Persian Medicine; Avicenna; Rhazes; Cupping Therapy; Massage therapy"

In the Brazilian context, nursing was a pioneer in recognizing these practices when, on July 18, 1995, with Normative Opinion No. 004, the Federal Nursing Council recognized alternative therapies as a specialty and/or qualification for nurses. The prevalence of nurses working with TCIM in Brazil is unprecedented data that strengthens the role of nurses, standing out for their generalist training close to the precepts of integrative care. Objective: to analyze the prevalence of nurses working with TCIM in Brazil.;A cross-sectional study, based on a national survey and written in accordance with the recommendations of Strengthening the Reporting of Observational studies in Epidemiology (STROBE). Data collection was performed using an online questionnaire from June 2021 to January 2022. The dependent variable in this study was the use of TCIM. Stata IC software, version 16.0, was used for statistical analysis. Descriptive analyses were performed, and the effect measures evaluated were the Prevalence Ratios (PR), performed using Poisson Regression with robust adjustment for variance, with accuracy assessed by 95% Confidence Intervals (95% CI) and the significance of the PR using the Wald Test. The study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee under Certificate of Presentation for Ethical Review number 43306921.6.0000.5347.;"1,154 nurses participated in the study. The prevalence of training in TCIM was 502/1,154 (43.50%), with 301/1,154 (26.08%) stating that they had training in auriculotherapy. The prevalence of practice in TCIM was 323/1,154 (27.99%). The most frequent weekly workload dedicated to the application of TCIM was two hours 119/322 (36.96%), with the majority 198/322 (61.49%) of participants applying up to four hours per week. Regarding the workplace where TCIM is practiced, 167/323 (51.70%) use it in Primary Health Care (PHC), corroborating data from research on the situation of PICS in Brazil, where almost 80% of them occur in PHC. Among the most frequent types of care, 287/323 (88.85%) provide individual care and 155/323 (47.99%) provide group educational activities. Among nurses who conduct research on evidence-based practices, 250/323 (77.40%) do so in the Virtual Health Library of Complementary and Integrative Traditional Medicines, 215/323 (66.56%) in books, 173/323 (53.56%) in specialized journals, 141/323 (43.65%) on Google, and 70/323 (21.67%) on the evidence map produced by the Brazilian Academic Consortium for Integrative Health. Having a postgraduate degree increases the probability of working in PICS by 99% (PR: 1.99; 95% CI: 1.35-2.94; p<0.001).";The most significant place of practice with TCIM was PHC, in the form of individual care, using evidence-based approaches. The results reflect the maturation of nursing as a field of study and practice and the growing appreciation of TCIM as evidence.;"Complementary Therapies; Nursing; Traditional Medicine Practioners; Integrative Medicine; Public Health"

The relevant aspects of the tongue to be identified are humidity, coating, color, size, movement, and other findings such as teeth marks, red dots, cracks, or fissures.
BACKGROUND: Considering the scenario of breast cancer and the recommendation of OI associated with conventional treatment, it is important for professionals working in this area to have access to an up-to-date assessment of the tongues of women during chemotherapy with anthracyclines.OBJECTIVE: This analysis aimed to evaluate tongue changes in women with breast cancer during treatment with anthracyclines, before and after chemotherapy, divided into 2 groups: acupuncture and control, to study the effect of acupuncture on myelodepression ";"The population of this study was made up of women recently diagnosed with breast cancer at UNIFESP's Mastology outpatient clinic and with an indication for chemotherapy with anthracyclines. The patients were randomized into two groups: the Acupuncture Group (AG) and the Control Group (CG). All the participants had their tongues photographed before and at the end of treatment with anthracyclines and had their WBC monitored as an indicator of the level of spinal cord depression. GA underwent acupuncture intervention for up to 10 sessions.
";"A total of 26 women were randomized into 2 groups: GA (10) and GC (16). Of these, 7 (26.9%) received an indication for a dense dose according to the service's protocol and therefore received granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) from the first cycle. Thus, in order to analyze the protective effect of acupuncture on the bone marrow, 2 women from the GA and 5 from the CG were excluded. The need for secondary prophylaxis with G-CSF occurred in 72.7% (08/11) of the control group and 12% (01/08) of the acupuncture group (p-value = 0.009). No change over time could be confirmed for most aspects of the tongue in either group. The only exception was for the tongue coating in the control group, where the ""thin/white"" profile was less frequent at the time afterwards (p-value=0.033).

";"Based on the results presented, acupuncture was effective in prophylaxis of myelosuppression, with no significant changes to the tongue; however, the tongue of the CG showed a worsening of the condition during treatment.

The objective of this research is to evaluate the efficacy of a homeopathic treatment (HOM) for smoking cessation or reduction and compare it to that of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT).;This was a single-center, non-randomized control, prospective, longitudinal clinical study conducted at the Policlinic of Duque de Caxias, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Recruitment occurred in 2019 with 39 participants treated exclusively with nicotine patches (control group), and in 2023 with 40 participants receiving heteroisotherapic homeopathic treatment (test group). The homeopathic intervention was personalized, and each participant was treated with the smoke extracted from their addictive cigarette using the Isomaker® apparatus. The HOM group used three tablets in the morning and evening and one tablet before each urge to smoke for 90 days. The Nicotine group had used nicotine patches for 90 days. Inclusion criteria were being at least 18 years old, both sexes, wanting to quit smoking, and being a current smoker. Exclusion criteria were being a passive smoker or an ex-smoker. The primary outcome was smoking tobacco cessation. Secondary outcomes were a reduction in tobacco dependence and adverse events.;Although no statistically significant difference was observed between the groups for the primary outcome (p = 0.165, Fisher's exact test), the findings suggest that the HOM intervention may be as effective as nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) for smoking cessation. While abstinence rates were higher in the NRT group (76%) compared to the HOM group (57.6%), this difference did not reach statistical significance and may be attributed to the limited sample size. These preliminary results support the potential of HOM as a viable alternative for the treatment of tobacco use disorder. Further research with larger, randomized, and multicentre trials is warranted to confirm these findings and strengthen the evidence base.;"Homeopathic treatment has shown potential as a safe approach to help reduce or quit smoking. The project is currently ongoing within the public health system, and the preliminary results presented to date are encouraging, paving the way for further studies.

Traditional preconception care has been little documented, leading women to access biomedical programs that often overlook their ancestral practices and result in undesirable side effects. For the Nasa people, health is understood as an integral balance between the body, spirit, environment, and community, in contrast to the medicalization of reproductive health.
Globalization has weakened the transmission of this knowledge, causing reproductive “disharmonies.” However, the rise of integrative medicine creates opportunities to revalue these practices. The community’s limited access to biomedical services reinforces the need to integrate traditional preconception care into public health programs to provide more culturally appropriate and preventive care. This study seeks to make these practices visible, strengthen community autonomy, and contribute to intercultural health dialogue and to more inclusive and sustainable public health policies.
Based on the above, the general objective of this study is to analyze ancestral practices and perceptions of Nasa traditional healers and midwives in the Indigenous Reservation of Toribío, Cauca, regarding preconception care.
";The research carried out in the Toribío Indigenous Reserve gathered valuable information on the Nasa people’s preconception care practices through semi-structured interviews and a focus group. Traditional knowledge holders—including Thê’ wala, midwives, healers, and experts in medicinal plants—actively participated, helping to identify elements that validate and strengthen these ancestral practices, which are deeply rooted in their holistic worldview. A chain sampling or “snowball” methodology was used to select participants, with support from the E.S.E. CXAYU’CE JXUT. In total, six individuals were interviewed (four midwives/ancestral knowledge holders and two traditional doctors), and the focus group brought together six key actors, including traditional doctors, midwives, ancestral knowledge holders, and community leaders.;"The findings showed that Nasa preconception care integrates physical, spiritual, and community dimensions, emphasizing the importance of rituals and ancestral knowledge to balance the uterus and prevent complications. The traditional diet, based on arracacha, plantain, and local protein sources, reflects not only a worldview of harmony with nature but also aligns with key nutrients (iron, folic acid) recognized by biomedicine as essential at this stage. However, younger generations tend to underestimate these ancestral practices due to external influences, exacerbating reproductive ""disharmonies.""";The study’s conclusions underscore the urgency of recognizing, respecting, and validating this ancestral knowledge in public policies and health programs, promoting its effective articulation with the Indigenous System of Intercultural and Autonomous Health (SISPI). Nasa medicine offers a holistic and preventive approach that, if strengthened, could contribute significantly to reducing gestational complications, reinforcing community autonomy, and building a health model that prioritizes the balance between body, spirit, and territory as the foundation of buen vivir (good living).;"Preconception care; traditional medicine; Indigenous communities; Intercultural health; Midwifery"

Most individuals exhibited mild to moderate respiratory symptoms1. Observing that scenario, some homeopaths initiated the “Homeopathy COVID-19 Urgent Solidarity Action” to provide free and remote appointments. Homeopathy has been part of the Brazilian public healthcare system since the 1980s. It is included in the National Policy on Integrative and Complementary Practices (PNPIC) within the Unified Health System (SUS). The use of these methods has already been demonstrated in previous papers as effective in other historical epidemics, such as Yellow Fever, Spanish Flu, Diphtheria, Typhoid Fever, Dengue, Chikungunya, and Cholera, and to COVID-19 pandemic. This prospective study aims to: (i) identify the homeopathic remedies prescribed; and (ii) identify the most frequently reported symptoms.";"This prospective observational study, conducted from 2021 to 2022, was approved by the Research Ethics Committee on Human Subjects (CAAE: 50104521.1.0000.5506, Approval No.: 5.009.104). Participants filled out a consensual form with personal data via the Internet. All teams were made up of professional volunteers who assisted the patients into four classified groups: NC (Non-COVID) – health promotion; DC (During COVID) – active infection; PC (Post-COVID) – persistent symptoms; VC (Vaccine-related symptoms) – reactions following immunization. Pharmacies supported the project by donating homeopathic medicines to various potencies. Coroninum, like other vaccine-based medicines, was prepared according to the Brazilian Homeopathic Pharmacopoeia’s biotherapic method. The first, was derived from oropharyngeal secretions of COVID-19-positive individuals and potentized through serial 1:100 dilutions (Hahnemannian centesimal scale) with 100 succussions.";"The distribution of participants among groups was NC – 40.7%, DC – 33.3%, VC – 16.1%, and PC – 9.9%. Most individuals seeking assistance (40.7%) had no comorbidities or risk factors. Most prescribed homeopathic remedies and frequently reported symptoms per group were: (i) NC – Coroninum and Arsenicum album for general health promotion; (ii) DC – China officinalis (14.8%), Arsenicum album (11.1%), and Coroninum (7.4%). Symptoms: fatigue, nasal congestion, cough, myalgia, sore throat, headache; (iii) PC – China officinalis (25%), Coroninum (25%), Arsenicum album (12.5%), Cocculus indicus (12.5%), Natrum muriaticum (12.5%), and Thuya officinalis (12.5%). Symptoms: fatigue, myalgia, dyspnea; (iv) VC – AstraZeneca vaccine isotherapy (38.5%), Arsenicum album (23%), Camphora (23%), Coronavac vaccine isotherapy (7.7%), Pfizer vaccine isotherapy (7.7%). Symptoms: headache. According to homeopathic principles, the evaluation is personal, because symptoms represent the body's response to disease and the imbalance of vital energy. The Coroninum biotherapic was the most frequently prescribed due to its correspondence with the disease’s causative agent. Arsenicum album got second place, not just as a result of its similarity to respiratory symptoms but because of its recognition by the Indian Ministry of Health as a primary homeopathic remedy for COVID-19.";Homeopathy is an integrative and complementary practice that has been used in past epidemics and was also one of the therapeutic options available during the COVID-19 pandemic, with research publications. The remedies were selected based on individualized symptoms, including Coroninum biotherapic and the classic Arsenicum album.;"Retrospective Study; COVID-19 pandemic; Homeopathy; homeopathic remedy; Complementary Therapies"

According to the International Agency for Research on Cancer, in 2012 there were 14.1 million new cases of cancer and 32.6 million pre-existing cases, with 8.2 million deaths. It is predicted that by 2035, there will be approximately 24.0 million new cases and 14.6 million deaths.?This rise in the cancer incidence is attributable to the continuous advances in treatment, which have led to more patients living with this disease. Consequently, there is an increasing demand for effective palliative care strategies. In this context, acupuncture and its therapies, such as moxibustion and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, emerge as promising treatment options, as there is evidence of its use for reducing symptoms commonly seen in cancer patients, such as cancer-related pain, fatigue, and reduced quality of life.? These interventions can provide a non-invasive and effective alternative for symptom management, seeking to attribute dignity and humanity to patients throughout their care.The objective of this review is to evaluate the effectiveness of acupuncture in providing symptom relief and improving the quality of life for palliative care cancer patients.;A functional search strategy was established in the Medline and BvSalud databases using the keywords “Acupuncture Therapy” and “Palliative Care,” retrieving 124 articles. The results were imported to Rayyan, where duplicates were excluded, and the selection of included articles was performed by the authors of this study in a blinded manner. The inclusion criteria were restricted to Randomized Clinical Trial or Systematic Review, while the exclusion criteria consisted of any other study design or non-oncological patients in palliative care.? After the selection was completed, the authors resolved conflicts by consensus and began data extraction using a standardized extraction protocol, followed by the full reading of the articles and the preparation of the integrative review. Finally, the writing of this work was carried out based on the obtained results.;"Slightly stronger effects were found in the acupuncture and related care group compared to isolated conventional care (pooled RR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.13 to 1.64). ?At the same time, no statistical differences were found between acupuncture or conventional analgesic treatment (pooled RR, 1.12; 95% CI, 0.98 to 1.28).? Regarding cancer-related fatigue, acupuncture with patient education significantly reduced fatigue compared to conventional treatment (two RCTs; pooled SMD, –2.12; 95% CI, –3.21 to –1.03). Finally, regarding quality of life, it was found that acupuncture improves the quality of life in lung cancer patients compared to conventional care alone (pooled SMD, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.04 to 0.90).";In summary, acupuncture and its related therapies have shown favorable therapeutic effects for the management of some cancer-associated complications. However, there is conflicting and insufficient evidence to support or refute the indiscriminate use of acupuncture in oncological patients in palliative care. ?;"Acupuncture Therapy; Palliative care; Cancer Pain"

Although it suggests inflammation, epicondylitis is actually related to lesions in the short radial extensor tendons of the wrist due to repetitive movements such as using computers, cash registers, playing piano, painting, carpentry, screw turning and weightlifting. This disorder is characterized by pain in the lateral epicondyle of the humerus and pain during dorsiflexion, which can compromise daily activities and reduce productivity. It can persist for 6 to 24 months, with 90% of patients recovering within 1 year, while 3 to 10% possibly experiencing chronic symptoms and necessitating surgery. The annual incidence is 4 to 7 per 1000 inhabitants, affecting 1 to 3% of the population, representing a high financial cost. Treatment consists in resting, anti-inflammatory medication and physiotherapy. Currently, acupuncture, a Chinese medicine therapy, is promising because it involves stimulating body points through needle insertion, which releases endorphins and enkephalins that reduces pain. It is a quick, effective treatment without the contraindications and adverse effects of anti-inflammatories, such as nausea, vomiting, bleeding, and kidney injuries. The objective of this review is to determine the effectiveness of acupuncture in treating adults with lateral epicondylitis.;A thorough search methodology was employed in the Medline and Lilacs databases with the terms “Acupuncture Therapy” and “Tennis Elbow,” retrieving 123 articles, sifted through Rayyan to exclude duplicates. Through a blind selection process, two researchers independently chose the most relevant studies. The inclusion criteria were restricted to Randomized Clinical Trials or Systematic Reviews relating to adult patients with lateral epicondylitis. Other types of studies or disorders besides lateral epicondylitis were omitted. Any conflicting views were reconciled by reaching a consensus. The researchers proceeded with systematic data collection following an established protocol and conducted a comprehensive review of the texts, resulting in the development of an integrative review.;Some randomized clinical trials showed that needle acupuncture provides pain relief for a significantly longer period than placebo (MD = 18.8 hours, 95% CI 10.1 to 27.5) and a higher probability of reducing pain by 50% or more (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.69) (Molsberger 1994). Another clinical trial revealed that needle acupuncture is more likely to improve overall pain in the short term than placebo (RR +0.09%, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.64) and that there are no significant differences in the long term (after 3 or 12 months). Another randomized clinical trial comparing laser acupuncture to placebo demonstrated no differences regarding overall benefit. And a trial conducted in China found no difference between vitamin B12 injection with acupuncture and vitamin B12 injections alone.;The analysis of the results shows evidence suggesting that acupuncture is effective in relieving pain caused by lateral epicondylitis and that it appears to be superior to drug therapy in some cases. Despite the published studies, further research regarding long-term treatment would be important to make an absolute recommendation about its use.?;"Acupuncture Therapy; Adult; Tennis Elbow"

Yoga is commonly used as a form of exercise that combines physical postures with breathing exercises and meditation.
Participation in yoga-based practices has increased in recent decades, as has research. There is evidence that the health benefits of yoga-based interventions are comparable to those of aerobic exercise. Yoga is also hypothesized to improve mental and cognitive health.
Governments in various countries have implemented different public health strategies to address the issue of mental health in older adults. Therefore, the objective of this research is to analyze the existing literature on the effectiveness of yoga on mental health  in older adults.";"The study design was a scoping review, and the PRISMA-Scr (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension) methodology was used to design the protocol. All types of study designs and reviews were included, and the publication period was limited from June 2015 to June 2025. To be included in the review, articles had to focus on specific dimensions: population: older adults, concept: yoga therapy, and context: mental health problems. No language restrictions were imposed; publications in English or Spanish were included. Search strategies were designed to collect information from the following databases: Medline/PubMed, LILACS, and The Cochrane Library. In addition, searches were conducted in BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine , Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine, International Journal of Yoga, and Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine. The study selection process was conducted independently by two reviewers using the Rayyan electronic platform (https://www.rayyan.ai) and was supervised by one of them. To this end, the references identified in each database were consolidated, and duplicate records were removed using this electronic platform. The identification, selection of records or articles, eligibility, and details of the selection process were presented using the PRISMA flowchart. . The results were summarized descriptively.";The search yielded 1,181 results, of which 30 were potentially retrieved articles that met the eligibility criteria. Two systematic reviews were included, following the eligibility criteria. Sleep problems, depression, and anxiety were the most common mental health problems, followed by quality of life, cognitive function, self-esteem, physical performance, and several others.;The available literature shows that yoga-based interventions offer a beneficial impact on improving sleep problems, anxiety, and depression in older adults. However, the methodological heterogeneity of the studies in terms of type of yoga practice, duration, and measurement tools limits the generalization of results. We suggest conducting methodologically rigorous randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to consolidate evidence of their effectiveness for future applications in clinical practice.;"Complementary Therapies; yoga; mental health; aged"

Emerging research suggests that microbial metabolites may function as bioactive compounds in cancer prevention and treatment, aligning with the holistic approaches of Traditional and Complementary Medicine (TCIM). This study evaluates the anticancer potential of three gut microbiota-derived metabolites—sodium butyrate, inosine, and nisin—against breast cancer cell lines.;The antiproliferative effects of the metabolites were assessed in vitro against two breast adenocarcinoma cell lines: MCF7 (estrogen receptor-positive) and MDA-MB-231 (triple-negative). Normal human breast epithelial cells (MCF10A) were included to assess cytotoxic selectivity. Cell viability was measured using the Alamar Blue assay. Apoptotic activity and reactive oxygen species (ROS) inhibition were evaluated via flow cytometry and ROS assays, respectively. Proteomics profiling was conducted using label-free nano-LC-MS/MS to determine molecular mechanisms in MCF7 cells.;"Sodium butyrate demonstrated the highest antiproliferative activity with IC?? values of 576 ?g/mL (MCF7) and 557 ?g/mL (MDA-MB-231). Inosine showed moderate cytotoxicity, while nisin exhibited limited activity. All three compounds significantly induced apoptosis and reduced ROS levels in both cancer cell lines. Proteomics analysis revealed that sodium butyrate modulated stress and hormonal signaling pathways—such as HSF1-mediated heat shock response and estrogen-dependent gene expression—while inosine and nisin primarily impacted cell cycle regulation.

These findings support the therapeutic potential of gut microbial metabolites, particularly sodium butyrate and inosine, as adjunctive agents in breast cancer management. Their selective cytotoxicity, sparing normal epithelial cells, reinforces their promise as safer alternatives or complements to conventional cancer therapies. The observed molecular mechanisms provide further justification for their inclusion in TCIM frameworks.";Gut microbial metabolites offer a novel, evidence-informed approach to breast cancer therapy. This study contributes to the growing validation of microbiota-based interventions within public health and TCIM, highlighting their role in addressing complex clinical conditions with biological precision and reduced toxicity.;"Gut microbiome; Integrative Oncology; Breast cancer; Postbiotics; Gut microbiota"

Atopic dermatitis (AD),a pervasive chronic inflamma.tory skin disease, afflicts roughly 20% of children and10% of adults . According to the latest data fromthe Global Burden of Disease 2019,AD continues tocause significant global morbidity from 1990 to 2019. Due to its intense itching and recurrent eczema.tous lesions, it has contributed to an adverse increasein neuropsychiatric issues including depression, atten-tion deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and suicidaideation. Among them, ADHD ranks as the pre.dominant neurodevelopmental disorder among chil.dren [5], with a global prevalence exceeding 5%.Given the escalating public health burden of ADand ADHD,systematically clarifying this bidirectionalrelationship is crucial for improving patient screening,treatment, and preventive strategies. Therefore, in thismeta-analysis, our objectives are threefold: (1) to eluci-date the bidirectional association between AD andADHD in both pediatric and adult populations; (2) toassess the influence of potential moderating factors(whether age, AD severity and other comorbiditieswould affect the results); and (3) to ascertain the prev-alence regardless of AD as either exposure or outcomevariables.";Adhering to PRISMA 2020, we conducted a comprehensive databasesearch up until March 11, 2024. 0bservational studies reporting on AD and ADHD as eithelexposure or outcome variables were included. A random-effects model meta-analysis wasconducted to calculate pooled estimates. Subgroup and meta-regression analyses were undertakento explore heterogeneity. Publication bias was investigated via funnel plots and Egger's test.;Overall, 49 studies were determined to meet the inclusion criteria after rigorous screeningPatients with AD were more ikely to have ADHD (ORs = 1.34,95% C1.25-1.44, D<0.01: HRS 1.42, 95% C1 1.20-1.68, p<0.01), while patients with ADHD also had an increased risk of developincAD (ORs= 1.45,95% C 1.21-1.73, p<0.01). Subgroup analyses indicated that the associationswere particularly pronounced among studies that assessed patients with severe AD (ORs = 2.6295% C1 1.76-3.92,p<0.01), suffered from multiple allergic conditions (ORs = 2.89, 95% C1 1.18-7.10,p<0.01)and sleep disturbances (ORs = 2.43,95% Cl 2.14-2.76,p<0.01) simultaneously.This systematic review rigorously examines existingevidence concerning the bidirectional associationbetween AD and ADHD within observational studies.Our analysis revealed that individuals with AD have a1.34-fold increased risk of developing ADHD. Moreover,our analysis also found that the prevalence of AD andthe risk of its development were elevated in patientswith ADHD, suggesting a potential bidirectional associ-ation between AD and ADHD.Thus, there is apressing need for further research in adult cohorts toimprove diagnosis and management. Additionally, significan p typically generated by large-scale researchunderscores the inherent limitation of meta-analysesbased on observational studies.;This meta-analysis indicates the reciprocal relationshipbetween AD and ADHD. The study emphasizes theimportance of interdisciplinary consultations to inte.grate these findings into clinical practice, thus improving mental health care and preventing healthdeterioration. Furthermore, to enhance physicians' abil-.ity to identify ilnesses early and develop effective preventive plans, standardization of diagnostic criteriaand additional research into mediating variables areneeded, especially in individuals with severe AD mani.)problems, and multiple allergicfestations, sleepdiseases.;"atopic dermatitis; attention deffcit/ hyperactivity disorder; Systematic Review; neuropsychiatric  comorbidity"

It is characterized by the imposition of hands with the aim of restoring physical, mental and spiritual balance, and given the growing adoption of this practice in various care contexts, it becomes necessary to investigate its impact on the routine of individuals, especially with regard to promoting well-being and strengthening self-care, thus justifying the relevance of this study. Given this, the question emerged: What is the impact of the regular application of Reiki in daily life? Guiding this work through the following objective: To report the impact of the regular application of Reiki in daily life.;This study addresses the following research question: What are the effects of regular Reiki practice on daily life? We present a qualitative study documenting the authors' participation in a weekly Reiki practice group. This Reiki group, affiliated with the Center for Studies and Research in Homeopathy and Phytotherapy at the Federal University of Paraíba, has been operating continuously since 2018. Data collection occurred through a focus group session during one of the regular meetings at April of 2025, facilitated by a trained moderator. Participant responses were transcribed and analyzed using Atlas.ti software to identify common themes, which were subsequently organized into two thematic categories. This research is part of a larger study approved by the Ethics Research Committee (CAAE: 79750424.4.0000.8069).;"Our analysis after transcription and coding revealed two primary thematic categories: TC1 – ""Emotional Awareness”; TC2 – ""Self-Regulation and Enhanced Relationships"". Discussion: The focus group participants reported various perceived benefits of Reiki, with responses coded alphanumerically for analysis.  Key findings for TC1 included statements such as: ""Reiki helps me stay more present and aware…""; ""I notice my breathing becomes deeper and calmer…""; ""It consistently brings me a sense of peace…""; These observations support existing literature on Reiki's role in promoting emotional consciousness. For TC2, significant responses were: ""It facilitates a journey of self-discovery…”; ""I've come to recognize this energy within myself…”; ""I find myself being more thoughtful, less judgmental, and more understanding of others…"". These reports align with PAHO (2023) documentation on how energy therapies can contribute to interpersonal connection, mindful communication, and emotional support.";Our initial findings suggest that consistent Reiki practice may lead to meaningful improvements in practitioners' quality of life. The identified themes demonstrate Reiki's value as a Complementary Therapy that supports emotional equilibrium, self-knowledge, and social connectedness. These results underscore the need for additional research to further establish Reiki's effectiveness and solidify its position as a valuable therapeutic approach among Complementary Therapies.;"Reiki; Energy healing; Complementary Therapies"

Stem cell therapy (SCT) has emerged as a promising regenerative strategy, with various cell types being explored for their efficacy in treating CLEUs. This umbrella review aims to consolidate the existing evidence on stem cell interventions for DCM, providing a comprehensive overview of the current research landscape.
CLEUs encompassing both leg ulcers and foot ulcers, are a common clinical problem, affecting approximately 1 to 2% of adults in the United States. The predominant etiologies comprise venous insufficiency, diabetes mellitus (DM), peripheral arterial disease (PAD), and pressure injury. It is well-recognized that chronic ulcers associated with diabetic foot, peripheral arterial ischemia, or venous thrombotic disease often exhibit a prolonged disease course, posing significant challenges to effective wound management. Failure to achieve timely healing may result in serious complications, including infection, necrosis, and even sepsis, ultimately resulting in amputation or mortality. Notably, nearly 70% of amputations have been attributed to non-healing wounds. This situation imposes a considerable burden not only on patients' quality of life but also on healthcare systems, with annual costs associated with venous leg ulcers and diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) estimated at $14.9 billion and $9-13 billion, respectively. Therefore, developing novel therapeutic approaches for chronic or refractory lower extremity ulcers is urgently required. 
";This umbrella review was conducted following the PRIOR and PRISMA guidelines. We searched across PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases for systematic reviews (SRs) and meta-analyses (MAs) that included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on SCT for CLEUs from inception to 3 March 2025. The methodological quality and evidence quality of the SRs/MAs were assessed by AMSTAR 2 and GRADE. A quantitative synthesis of all RCTs included in the SRs/MAs to obtain objective and updated conclusions.;"A total of 28 SRs/MAs involving 72 RCTs were included, though the methodological quality and evidence quality were generally unsatisfactory. Our updated meta-analysis indicated that SCT provided potential therapeutic benefits for CLEUs, as indicated by effectiveness in measures, including healing rate, ulcer size reduction, complete healing time, amputation rate, ankle-brachial index, transcutaneous oxygen pressure, new angiogenesis rate, pain-free walking distance, rest pain score, amputation-free survival, and all-cause mortality.
This umbrella review synthesizes evidence from existing SRs/MAs to evaluate the efficacy and safety of SCT for CLEUs. Despite advances in medical management, the treatment of CLEUs remains a significant clinical challenge. Recently, SCT has shown great promise in the field of regenerative medicine48, particularly for the treatment of chronic skin ulcers secondary to DM or peripheral vascular diseases.
";"SCT represents a promising adjunctive therapy for CLEUs, with many studies demonstrating its safety and potential benefits. However, current evidence is limited by methodological flaws and study heterogeneity. High-quality RCTs in the future are crucial to truly proving the benefits of SCT for CLEUs.

Manual reduction with splint fixation (MRSF), as a traditional Chinese medicine approach, has been applied for treating DRF for centuries. There is still a lack of rigorous evidence regarding its effectiveness, safety, and cost-effectiveness.;Five Chinese databases (Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure [CNKI], China Science and Technology Journal Database [VIP], Sinomed, Yiigle Database, and Wanfang Database) and five international databases (PubMed, EMBase, the Cochrane Library, Epistemonikos and Web of Science Core Collection) were searched from inception until 20 February, 2025 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Studies comparing MRSF with surgical treatment in adult DRF were eligible. The primary outcome were the wrist function and adverse events. The secondary outcomes included quality of life and economic outcomes. The Cochrane risk of bias (RoB) 2.0 tool and the GRADE approach were used to assess the certainty of the evidence. A meta-analysis was performed via RevMan 5.4.1 software.;"Thirty-four RCTs with 3493 participants were included. The overall RoB of included studies was some concerns to high. In general, the certainty of evidence was rated as low to moderate. The wrist function was assessed using eight different validated scales across the included studies. Compared to open reduction with internal fixation (ORIF), MRSF showed significant improvement in the early three months (Cooney score: MD 20.62, 95% CI 16.83 to 24.21, 2 RCTs, 189 participants; Mayo score: MD ?1.08, 95% CI ?4.18 to 2.03, 2 RCTs, 126 participants; Dienst score: MD ?7.23, 95% CI ?9.68 to ?4.78, 1 RCT, 63 participants). MRSF was also associated with significantly lower treatment cost (MD ?24.66 thousand yuan, 95%CI ?26.25 to ?23.07, 2 RCTs, 328 participants). Compared to K-wire fixation, MRSF demonstrated a higher excellent rate assessed by Gartland-Werley score and better quality of life at 3 months. No significant harms were observed in relation to MRSF.";Although MRSF appears to be a promising cost effective modality, the absence of standardized operational procedures limits its broader adoption. Further large-scale prospective studies are still required to confirm its benefits and harms and support the development of MRSF guidelines.;"Radius fracture; comprehensive value assessment; Traditional Chinese Medicine; nonpharmacological therapy"

Severe AA shows acute onset with high mortality from hemorrhage/infection without timely intervention. China's annual incidence is 7.4/106, with a 1.18:1 male-to-female ratio and an elderly incidence peak. Western medicine uses immunosuppressive therapy, stem cell transplantation, etc., but faces challenges like toxicity, transfusion dependency, and high costs.
In TCM, AA is ""sui lao,"" treated by tonifying kidney/spleen, resolving phlegm/stasis, and detoxification. TCM improves symptoms, regulates immunity, and reduces side effects. However, TCM RCTs for AA have non-standardized syndrome diagnostic criteria, inconsistent efficacy evaluation standards, varied outcome measures, and lack of TCM-specific indicators.

The foundational treatment in the Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) group utilizes the Xiangxia Formula. The experimental group receives the TCM Xiangxia Formula treatment combined with TCM emotion regulation intervention. Subsequently, the randomization allocation probabilities are updated using the response-adaptive randomization method.

The herbal formula used in this study is Xiangxia Formula. Its core herbal components include: Huoxiang (???, Pogostemon cablin), Xiangfu (??, Cyperus rotundus), Banzhilian (???, Scutellaria barbata), Qingbanxia (???, Processed Pinellia ternata), Baihe (??, Lilium brownii), Wuyao (??, Lindera aggregata), Houpo (??, Magnolia officinalis bark), Zhishi (??, Immature fruit of Citrus × aurantium), Jianghuang (??, Curcuma longa rhizome).

Countries of Use: As a clinically empirical formula, Xiangxia Formula is primarily used within the Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) healthcare systems in China and among Chinese communities worldwide.

TCM emotion regulation interventions include: 
1. Psychological Care: Establish a supportive nurse-patient relationship through active communication. Listen attentively to emotional distress and apply tailored emotion-regulating techniques based on individual emotional states.  

2. Five-Element Music Therapy: Play soft, soothing music selected according to TCM Five-Element theory to promote relaxation and reduce negative emotions.  

3. Psychological Counseling: Guide patients to release inner pressure through appropriate channels. Cultivate optimistic emotional attitudes.  

4. Mindfulness Training & Relaxation Therapy: Play calming background music while instructing patients in breathing techniques to alleviate psychological stress. Utilize deep breathing and meditation to maintain mental equilibrium.  


";"Results are not yet available as participant recruitment is pending. The primary endpoint is the response rate at week 4 post-treatment. Secondary endpoints include response rates at weeks 8, 12, and 16. Patient data will be recorded for primary efficacy measures, secondary efficacy measures, and safety measures. This study aims to clarify the efficacy and safety of response-adaptive randomization-based TCM emotion regulation intervention for patients with functional dyspepsia (FD).Key outcomes include treatment efficacy (symptom improvement), safety profiles (adverse events), and performance of the response-adaptive randomization algorithm.


";This study aims to evaluate whether integrating TCM emotion regulation with Xiangxia Formula improves outcomes for functional dyspepsia versus herbal treatment alone. By utilizing response-adaptive randomization, we seek to ethically optimize participant allocation based on early efficacy signals. Results will clarify the incremental value and safety of this combined TCM approach.

In China, ~30% of sepsis patients develop ARDS, with a 20%-50% worldwide mortality rate. The 2020 Expert Consensus requires sepsis-ARDS diagnosis to meet Sepsis 3.0 and the 2012 Berlin Definition. The 2023 Chinese guidelines updated criteria by including SpO2/FiO2. Current treatment relies on supportive care, but mortality remains high.
In TCM, ARDS is ""Chuan Zheng,"" with toxins, stasis, heat, and phlegm as key pathologies. TCM's efficacy in treating sepsis-ARDS has been confirmed. RCTs are the gold standard for clinical evaluation, and core outcome sets (COS) standardize essential indicators. Constructing a COS for TCM treatment helps reduce outcome measure heterogeneity, enabling pooled analysis and higher-level evidence. This paper investigates outcome indicators in TCM RCTs for sepsis-ARDS, analyzes issues, and informs COS development.";Comprehensive literature searches were conducted in databases such as China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKl), Wanfang Data, PubMed, CochraneLibrary and Embase. Furthermore, the relevant studies were identified through the Chinese ClinicalTrial Registry (ChiCTR) and ClinicalTrials.gov. According to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, randomized controlled trials of traditional Chinese medicine in the treatment of septicemic ARDS were screened, and the use of various outcome indicators was statistically analyzed.;A total of 83 RCTs and 7 clinical trial registration schemes were included in this study, reporting 186 outcome indicators in total, which were classified into seven domains according to functional attributes: quality of life, laboratory tests, TCM patterns, symptoms and signs, long-term prognosis, economic evaluation, and safety events. Laboratory test indicators accounted for the highest proportion (128 items), covering inflammatory factors, arterial blood gas analysis, pulmonary function, etc. The TCM pattern domain involved 26 TCM syndrome types (mainly intestinal heat and stomach excess syndrome, Yangming stomach excess syndrome), as well as TCM symptom scores and syndrome efficacy evaluation. Long-term prognosis indicators included 28-day mortality rate, ICU length of stay, etc., while economic evaluation indicators only accounted for 2.22%. The study also found problems such as poor consistency in diagnostic criteria (sepsis diagnosis was clarified in 77.78%, ARDS diagnosis in 73.33%, and there were 25 TCM diagnostic criteria), inconsistency in efficacy evaluation criteria (6 criteria for clinical efficacy and 3 criteria for TCM syndrome efficacy), great heterogeneity in the selection and measurement of outcome indicators, and insufficient TCM-specific indicators.;There are many issues with the current use of outcome indicators. Therefore, it is essential to construct a COS for the TCM treatment of sepsis-induced ARDS. This will assist clinical researchers in selecting outcome indicators more reasonably and reflect the distinctive advantages of TCM in treating critical severe diseases.;"Sepsis; Acute respiratory distress syndrome; Traditional Chinese Medicine; core outcome set; outcome measures"

The impact of the individual remedy, Natrium muriaticum and Pulsatilla (in the same potency, 30 or 200c) vs. placebo globules on human blood in vitro was tested by means of Kaelin’s blood test; the tested globules were added to both the stationary and mobile phases.

The study was approved by the local ethics committee.";"Highly significant differences in colour distribution were observed across patients, with some differences also found between treatments and potencies. A significant interaction between patient and treatment suggests that the effect of homeopathic remedies is individual-specific and varies among donors. Most responsive samples came from patients with acute conditions.
Our study shows that the chromatographic Kaelin blood test is sensitive to homeopathic globules added to human blood hemolysates in vitro, and that the effects produced by the remedies on the blood patterns are blood donor specific, thus individual."; Kaelin’s blood test appears to be a promising tool for basic research in homeopathy and may have potential as a method for monitoring treatment efficacy.

Novel Insights from two independent ELMEDIT n-of-1 studies;Meditation has been integral to religious traditions such as Buddhism, Daoism, Hinduism, and Christianity for millennia. In recent decades, meditation and mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) have gained scientific and clinical relevance. Evidence supports their efficacy in conditions like depression, anxiety, stress, insomnia, addiction, psychosis, pain, and cancer-related symptoms. Regular practice has also been associated with reductions in diastolic blood pressure. However, the acute cardiovascular effects of meditation in older adults remain unclear. This study aims to explore immediate physiological changes during meditation in elderly participants.;This exploratory study consists of two independent n=1 trials, conducted in parallel, involving one participant with long-term meditation experience (LME) and one with no meditation experience (NME). Eligible participants were aged 70+ with typical geriatric multimorbidity or over 80 years. During the whole session, both participants were sitting in a relaxed meditation position . Each session began with a five-minute baseline phase (T0), while they quietly contemplated a painting, followed by over five minutes of paced breathing to standardize cardiovascular parameters. The core meditation phase lasted at least 30 minutes and could be adjusted by the participant using predefined hand signals. A final paced breathing phase served as a washout period. Primary outcomes included cardiovascular parameters: heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP), pulse transit time (PTT), and perfusion index (PI).;"We enrolled one participant (male, 78 years) with long-term meditation experience (LME), who is a Tai Chi instructor with approximately 50 years of meditation practice and one no meditation-experienced (NME) participant (male, 80 years) of comparable health status, and multimorbidity profile. Regarding the differences between baseline (T0) and meditation status (T1), results show a HR decrease in both participants (mean±SD: LME- T0: 69.1±8.1, T1: 67.4±4.1; NME- T0: 75.0±1.6, T1: 73.4±3.4), but opposite changes between LME and NME with MAD increase in LME (LME- T0: 111.5±1.8, T1: 120.0±3.7; NME- T0: 109.6±1.7, T1: 105.2±2.2), PTT decrease in LME (LME- T0: 221.8±4.1, T1: 212.3±9.7; NME- T0: 221.7±4.7, T1: 237.0±8.3) and PI decrease in LME (LME- T0: 4.0±1.2, T1: 2.9±0.5; NME T0: 3.0±0.3, T1: 3.5±0.6), indicating a higher sympathetic tone in the vascular system in LME during meditation.";"To our surprise, we observed a distinct, time-limited increase in cardiovascular activity —comparable to that during aerobic exercise — for the participant with long-term meditation experience, despite the subject sitting in complete stillness and outward calm. Certain traditional Asian practices, such as archery or acupuncture, emphasize a paradoxical state of ""relaxation within tension"". This often-overlooked concept in meditation research may help interpret our findings and suggests that such physiological activation could also occur during meditation. In our study, we could demonstrate this phenomenon, indicating a possible extension of the current understanding of meditative states. This may be particularly relevant for older individuals, for whom regular physical training may be limited due to age-related constraints. Such forms of meditation could potentially serve as a substitute, contributing to prevention and healthy aging. Further research is warranted to explore and validate these novel observations.";"Meditation; Elderly; Cardiorespiratory Regulation; Exercise; Autonomic Nervous System"

Cancer registries play a crucial role by systematically collecting and analyzing clinical and demographic information on affected individuals. With the growing use of integrative oncology to improve health outcomes and quality of life, identifying predictors of treatment response is essential for optimizing care. This study investigates such predictors using data from the INTREST registry.;INTREST is a prospective cohort study collecting register data at four German certified cancer centers offering integrative cancer therapies. Patient-reported outcomes and clinical cancer data of women with pTNM stage I-III breast cancer were collected at the time of diagnosis, after completing neo?/adjuvant chemotherapy, after completing adjuvant antihormonal or targeted therapy as well as 1, 2, 5, and 10?years after baseline. Endpoints for multivariable prediction models were cancer-related quality of life, fatigue, treatment adherence, and progression-based outcomes/survival. Predictors included the study center, sociodemographic characteristics, histologic cancer and comorbidity data, performance status, stress perception, depression, anxiety, sleep quality, spirituality, social support, physical activity, diet behavior, type of conventional treatments, and use of and attitudes towards complementary treatments. Women were classified as treatment responders if they were above the 25th percentile of the adult female population for a retrospective outcome and reached the same or higher scores in comparison to their respective baseline values. Women, who scored below the respective 25th percentile of the female US adult population or reported a minimal clinically important worsening, were defined as non-responders. Using a set of bootstrap samples, a random forest classification method was applied to the data to identify relevant predictors for treatment response or non-response.;Based on the data of 1.417 women included, our analyses showed that the analyzed INTREST cohort of women suffering from breast cancer does not significantly differ from population-based registries and pragmatic trial data of breast cancer patients in Germany with respect to main sociodemographic and clinical cancer data. Using the classification criteria, 404 women (28.51%) were defined as responders and 571 (40.30%) as non-responders at 2 years follow-up. Random forest analysis on 500 bootstrapped samples revealed that apart from body mass index (importance: 25.46), age (importance: 21.01) and stress level (importance: 20.17) and CAM Health Beliefs regardless of actual use (importance: 18.92) were important predictors for treatment response.;Identifying predictors for short- and long-term response to integrative breast cancer treatment is crucial for improving cancer care as well as the quality and quantity of life for patients affected by cancer. Based on the identified predictors, an individualized integrative oncology program – particularly one that includes stress reduction strategies – appears to be useful to enhance treatment response. Future analyses with more in-depth statistical modeling are planned to gain deeper insights into the characteristics of potential responders and non-responders.;"Breast cancer; complementary medicine; Integrative Cancer Treatment; Predictors; Treatment Response"

Synthesis Clinic UK offers a medically-led personalised IO outpatient program for patients with cancer used alongside standard of care therapies. This incorporates medical input, nutrition and lifestyle medicine, prehabilitation and rehabilitation, psycho-oncology and other supportive modalities, including but not limited to art and yoga therapy, acupuncture, herbal medicine, mistletoe therapy and loco-regional modulated hyperthermia (mEHT). This study evaluated unmet supportive care needs and how IO approaches could address them among women with breast cancer (BC) and gynaecological cancer (GC) recruited from community support networks and clinic patients.;A cross-sectional online survey was conducted in partnership with the National Centre for Integrative Oncology (NCIO) with internal REC (Research Ethics Committee) approval SYN3052025. The 24-item questionnaire assessed demographics, cancer history, and access to information and support related to side effects, menopause, sleep, nutrition, psychological wellbeing, and sexual health with additional 20 questions around integrative care administered to clinic patients. Descriptive analysis was performed.;"A total of 201 women with breast and gynaecological cancer from the community responded between April–May 2025 (96% BC). Most of the BC cohort were White/White British (97.4%), aged 50–59 (47.4%) or 60–70 (28.7%), highly educated (64.1% university-level), employed (62.5%) and had primary breast cancer (76%). Overall, within the BC cohort undergoing standard care 64.1% were not convinced that they received adequate information to manage illness and side effects, and 72.4% reported not being well-informed about management of treatment-related side effects. Information on menopause was inadequate or lacking for 77.1%, sleep for 93.2%, exercise for 75.5% and nutrition for 78.1%. Emotional support was insufficient within standard care: 69.3% limited opportunity to discuss concerns, and 82.3% received no support for sexual health. Unmet needs in the GC cohort were similar but worse overall across all the highlighted concerns. 
In patients who answered questions on IO care (n= 23), the highlighted needs were met to a significantly higher degree. 100% of respondents felt that integrative oncology support was important in their overall care, with over 70% rating it as extremely important. Only 6% were not convinced that they received adequate information to manage illness and side effects, and 4% reported not being well-informed about management of treatment-related side effects. Information on menopause was not adequate or lacking for 9%, sleep for 13%, exercise for 9% and nutrition for 4%. Regarding emotional support, only 4% limited opportunity to discuss concerns within the integrative oncology clinic setting.";Findings highlight considerable unmet needs in breast and gynaecological caners across multiple domains of care.

In 2019, the state issued the “Regulations on the Administration of Human Genetic Resources of the People’s Republic of China”, which attracted global attention. And one of the key links in the construction and scientific management process of biobanks is the preliminary ethical review. Ethics is a protective umbrella for effectively ensuring the legal and reasonable operation of biobanks. However, there are currently no unified ethical standards and norms specifically implemented for biobanks in China. How to manage biobanks in a more comprehensive and effective manner regarding ethical issues is worthy of in - depth exploration. Therefore, for the ethical construction of biobanks, it is necessary to explore the current situation of research in this field and clarify the existing problems and development needs.

Randomized controlled trials involving patients diagnosed with FGIDs based on recognized criteria, with no restrictions on gender, disease duration, or severity. The primary outcome was treatment remission posttreatment. Risk of bias assessment, quality of evidence evaluation, subgroup analysis, and trial sequential analysis were performed. Date mining and network meta-analysis were used to identify optimal treatment approaches and acupoint prescriptions.;Results: A total of 33 trials involving 2,374 participants were included. AA demonstrated significant benefits in improving treatment efficacy (Risk ratios, RR 1.24, 95% CI 1.20–1.29, P < 0.00001), alleviating symptoms (standardized mean difference, SMD -1.13, 95% CI -1.55 to -0.71, P < 0.00001), and enhancing quality of life (SMD -1.29, 95% CI -2.30 to -0.28, P = 0.01). Only minor adverse effects were reported. Data mining revealed the most frequently used acupoints were CO13, CO7, and CO12, with common combinations including CO13-CO4, CO13-CO12, and CO13-CO7. The network meta-analysis revealed that AA combined with conventional medicine was the most effective treatment, followed by AA alone, conventional medicine, and sham AA, which was least effective.;Conclusion: AA significantly improves treatment effectiveness, symptom relief, and quality of life in FGID patients, with relatively mild adverse reactions. Acupoint prescriptions and treatment methods are important factors affecting the effectiveness.;"auricular acupuncture; Functional gastrointestinal disorders; Systematic Review; randomized controlled trials"

In Brazil, these practices were officially incorporated into the Unified Health System (SUS) in 2006. Despite significant progress in public policy, the educational dimension remains one of the greatest challenges for the effective implementation of these practices. This study describes the creation, development, and evaluation of a postgraduate specialization course in ICHP, offered by a Brazilian public university. The course aimed to fill a training gap by presenting the 29 practices currently offered by SUS, promoting a broader understanding of the health-disease-care process. The initiative sought not only to inform and train professionals but also to foster a ""culture of care,"" based on humanization, shared responsibility, and empowerment. ";Two editions of the course were held between 2021 and 2024. The first was delivered entirely online due to the COVID-19 pandemic, while the second adopted a hybrid format. Both editions prioritized an organic methodology, reflective practices, and a close relationship between students and faculty. Professors were nominated by their respective national associations, strengthening both the legitimacy of the course and the connection between academia and the community. To assess the course's impact, students responded to open-ended questionnaires at the beginning and end of the course. The instruments collected demographic data, professional background, motivations, expectations, and perceptions regarding the course's relevance and structure. Preliminary analysis reveals significant transformations in the students' personal and professional trajectories, indicating the course's effectiveness in building a new perspective on care and self-care, based on multidimensionality and completeness.;The results reinforce the need for the more systematic integration of ICHP education into higher education curricula, especially in health-related fields. In both cohorts (approximately 78% of participants), students reported feeling deeply transformed and better prepared to incorporate new integrative practices into their work, indicating that the course has fulfilled its role in promoting meaningful change.;It is concluded that qualified education in ICHP, when guided by an integrative, critical, and humanizing approach, has the potential not only to strengthen human resources for the SUS but also to expand the epistemological field of health care. This could contribute not only to broadening therapeutic options within SUS but also to building more humane, culturally sensitive, and financially sustainable health systems. The Brazilian experience, as detailed in this study, may serve as a model for other countries seeking to integrate traditional, complementary, and integrative medicine into formal education and health services.;"Integrative and complementary health practices; Health Education; Culture of Care"

It is also mainly responsible for systemic consequences like inflammatory, cardiovascular, and metabolic diseases. Restoration of the mitochondrial activity might then constitute a potential therapeutic target to be accomplished. In that sense, two homeopathic complexes Ubichinon compositum® (Ubi) and Coenzyme compositum® (Comp) (Heel, Baden-Baden, Germany), have been used in clinical practice as complementary therapy for all those problems potentially related to oxidative stress. The objective of this study was to establish an in vitro model to evaluate the protective activity of these compounds.;To understand the effects of both mixes, human fibroblasts isolated from the foreskin were exposed to different concentrations of the compounds to detect changes in the metabolic processes related to viability by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H- tetrazolium bromide (MTT). Later, the mixes were tested to observe any pro-survival, anti-stress effects of the fibroblasts that were exposed and stressed to H2O2 (ROS cell stressor). To assess the effects on cell metabolism and viability, three tests were performed, considering two times, 24h and 48h, and concentrations including control medium, medium + PBS (nutrient reduction), x/8, x/4, X/2 and X (100%, the concentration recommended by the manufacturer) in a 96-well plate. We choose to use the X/2 concentration. We seek to know if the exposure during different time points (tx) to the compounds may cause a preventive effect for the cells against the cell stressor.  Next, we aimed to test whether the administration of the compounds at zero time, plus the administration of the cellular stressor H2O2 helps fibroblasts to survive (Protection Assay). Both compounds were tested alone or in combination. After obtaining these results, we include a positive protection control that is physiologically known. We used 15mM glutathione, that is, 15mg in 54.2mL of solvent, and tested it by Flow Cytometry using a fluorescent marker of ROS production.;"The results from incubating fibroblasts with hydrogen peroxide, as well as with the simultaneous addition of Coenzyme compositum (Comp), Ubichinon compositum (Ubi) showed that hydrogen peroxide (H?O?) reduces fibroblast viability, while the addition of either Coenzyme compositum or Ubichinon compositum restores their viability—an effect also observed when both products are used in combination. After obtaining these results, a second model was developed to evaluate the ability of these products, alone or in combination, to preserve the viability of fibroblasts exposed to oxidative stress induced by hydrogen peroxide, the addition of H?O? reduces fibroblast viability to 37.7%. However, when the fibroblasts exposed to hydrogen peroxide were incubated simultaneously with Coenzyme compositum (CO), their viability was restored to 78.6%. In contrast, when incubated with Ubichinon compositum (UBI), the viability of the fibroblasts exposed to H?O? was restored to 67.9%.

";In conclusion, the compounds showed a protective effect after ROS damage, which can be synergistic if used together. Further assays will help to better understand this effect and observe an improvement in cellular function.;"mitochondria; Oxidative Stress; protection; homeopathic treatment"

Among Brazilian nurses, TCIM has been relevant for promoting a more integral and ethical clinical practice, becoming a formal specialty on the rise. Quantitative data is needed to measure the expansion and characterize the profile of these nurses. Objective: To describe data from a national survey on the profile and training of nurses in TCIM in Brazil.;This is a quantitative, cross-sectional, online study which used a questionnaire containing open and closed questions for 1,154 nurses in Brazil. Stata IC software, version 16.0, was used for the statistical analysis. Descriptive and inferential statistical tests were tested. The project was approved by the Ethics Committee under CAAE No. 43306921.6.0000.5347.;"This study included 1,154 nurses, 99.65% Brazilian, women (90%), with an average age of 39, self-declared white (72.65%), born in the South (45.06%), married (41.28%), with children (56.93%), with an income of up to four minimum wages (52.43%) and with active professional registration (97.31%-1,120/1,154). The prevalence of training in TCIM was 43.50% (502/1,154), carried out on average for the first time in 2014 (SD=7.38 years) and the recurring practices were Auriculotherapy (59.96%), Imposition of Hands (37.45%), Aromatherapy (29.28%) and Acupuncture (27.49%). The first contact with MCTI was as patients (15%-173/1,154), through professional colleagues (11.79%-136/1,154), or through people in the health sector (9.36%-108/1,154). The investment in TCIM training courses was up to R$1,000.00 per year for 61.77% of the participants and 85.97% believed in the rise of this job market. The prevalence of working in TCIM was 64.6% (323/500) and the workload was up to two hours a week (36.96%). The most common place of work was primary care (UBS, ESF) for 33.40% (167/500), followed by clinics or private practices (24.0%-120/500). These consultations were characterized as individual (78%-390/500), followed by group educational activities (31.0%-155/500), group sessions (17.60%-88/50) and telecare (11.40%-55/500). The study also showed that nine out of 10 participants (93.01%) consider TCIM to be important or very important for their professional work. They stated that having knowledge of, contact with or use of TCIM influences the autonomy of nurses (88.20%) and patients (96.8%). When asked about conducting research into evidence-based conduct to support a technique or practice, 50.0% (250/500) reported searching in the Virtual Health Library of Traditional Complementary and Integrative Medicines; 43.0% (215/500) in books; 34.60% (173/500) in specialized journals; 28.20% (141/500) in Google and 14.0% (70/500) in the evidence maps produced by the Brazilian Academic Consortium of Integrative Health. 56.87% (285/501) of the participants reported lacking some knowledge in areas such as management, social or private entrepreneurship or administration in order to incorporate TCIM into their work routine.";The growth of TCIM in nursing is undeniable, with a predominance in PHC, but there are training gaps in management. Valuing TCIM and its transformative potential reinforces the need for public investment in training and structuring services.;"Nursing; Traditional Complementary and Integrative Medicine; Professional Training"

Data regarding sociodemographic and clinical characteristics were collected through an electronic form developed by the researcher. Sleep quality was assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index instrument, published by Buysse in 1989, translated and validated into Portuguese, and consists of a questionnaire that assesses sleep quality over a one-month period. It contains 24 questions with scores ranging from 0 to 3, with 5 questions used only for clinical information and 19 categorized into seven components: subjective sleep quality; sleep latency; sleep duration; habitual sleep efficiency; sleep disorders; use of sleeping medication; and daytime dysfunction. The sum of the scores of the seven components produces an overall score from 0 to 21, where the highest score indicates the worst sleep quality. An overall score greater than 5 indicates poor sleep quality.";"From September 2024 to May 2025, 303 people completed the form with the questionnaires and the informed consent form to participate in the research. Of these, 39 people did not answer the questionnaire completely, making it impossible to continue the research, and 59 people did not meet the age criterion (over 60 years old). A total of 206 people met the eligibility criteria. Regarding the sociodemographic characteristics of the respondents, 85.1% were women, 47.6% were married, 79.1% declared themselves to be white, and 65% had higher education. Regarding the clinical characteristics of sleep: 18.9% reported undergoing some treatment for insomnia, and 91.3% suffer from some sleep-wake disorder. Regarding the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, the average overall score of the respondents was 10.88, with a standard deviation of 4.07, which indicates the presence of sleep disorders. The components with the highest average scores were: component 1 (subjective sleep quality); 2 (sleep latency) and 5 (presence of sleep disorders) respectively.";The data presented reveal that among the physiological changes of aging is the change in sleep patterns, which become more superficial and fragmented in the elderly, resulting in reduced and less effective sleep quality, making research into interventions to manage these changes necessary.

Nevertheless, costs, together with the effectiveness of such interventions are still considered as an important argument for political decision-makers when it comes to reimbursability by health insurances or integration of such approaches in treatment guidelines. This presentation  based on current health-economic research aims at shedding light on this aspect and attempts to use recent findings to highlight implications for further research.;After an introduction to the terminology of health economics, an overview of the relevant research in integrative medicine is given using a systematic search for reviews on helath economics in the field of integrative medicine. Using the results of these systematic reviews on health economic studies in integrative medicine relevant data such as origin, health economic approach and patient population are extracted and presented. Based on an examination of the quality of included studies using measures like the Consensus on Health Economic Criteria (CHEC) List, pitfalls as well as methodological strengths and weaknesses are also identified. ;In addition to early reviews that dealt with health economic studies and their quality in general, comparative analyses can also be carried out for specific areas. In all reviews screened, a more or less pronounced positive trend in study quality is visible. However, despite an increased awareness for conducting high quality clinical trials in Integrative Medicine, health economic evaluations still tend to be fragile in terms of guideline adherence and methodological rigor. This harbors the danger of the entire and entirely justified approach being discredited. Based on the positive examples of health economic evaluations, suggestions for a comprehensive methodological framework as to how and why various health economic approaches may be applied to Integrative Medicine in a sound and accurate way are presented.;Researchers planning a cost evaluation should be encouraged but also feel reminded that economic evaluation methodology increasingly calls for proper quality of life estimates and preferably the use of incremental cost effectiveness and/or net health benefit estimates. If there is an attitude to increase the quality of health economic evaluations, Integrative Medicine would generate good arguments for stakeholders and decision makers in the health care system. ;"Health economic evaluation; quality; modelling; Review"

Therefore, maintaining their quality of life is of paramount importance. Family members and caregivers of neurodiverse children face ongoing challenges that can lead to stress, anxiety, and depression. Complementary and Integrative Health Practices (CIPs) are known for their positive effects, promoting a state of calm and balance, which can be used as significant support for mental and emotional health. Considering the care provided to these caregivers, a 12-week group program was developed, including CIPs and psychoeducation on self-care, with the aim of analyzing the impact of CIPs on the quality of life, stress, and anxiety of caregivers and family members of neurodiverse children.;This study was conducted through a longitudinal randomized clinical trial, lasting 12 (twelve) weeks. A total of 12 (twelve) caregivers and family members of neurodiverse children who receive care at the Núcleo pela Criança (NUPI) in a city in the state of Paraná, located in southern Brazil, participated. All participants authorized the research through the Free and Informed Consent Form. The participants were divided into two groups: the Intervention Group (IG) and the Control Group (CG). The IG participated in weekly meetings that included complementary practices, such as auriculotherapy, aromatherapy, Tai Chi Chuan, Yoga and relaxation techniques. Each weekly session, lasting approximately 120 minutes, consisted of a theoretical lecture and practical activities related to the topic addressed, led by an interdisciplinary team. The CG was composed of family members who accompanied the children during treatment at the same institution, but did not participate in the therapeutic interventions offered to the IG. The effectiveness of the interventions was assessed using validated questionnaires, including the WHOQOL-Bref, Stress Perception Scale (EPS-10) and the Anxiety Inventory (BAI). The questionnaires were administered at the beginning and at the end of the program, after the 12 weeks of intervention.;The results showed that CIPs promoted statistically significant improvements in stress and anxiety levels and in the perception of quality of life among IG participants. A progressive reduction in stress and anxiety scores was observed over the 12 weeks, accompanied by an increase in indicators of subjective well-being and satisfaction with life, as measured by the validated instruments used. In contrast, CG participants showed stability in the scores of the same variables, with no statistically relevant changes throughout the period analyzed.;This evidence reinforces the potential of CIPs as adjuvant therapeutic strategies in the care of family members and caregivers of neurodiverse children, contributing significantly to the promotion of emotional well-being. The data suggest that the systematic insertion of these practices can favor emotional regulation, the attenuation of symptoms related to stress and anxiety, in addition to positively impacting the subjective perception of quality of life. These results support the use of CIPs in contexts of psychosocial care and comprehensive health care, highlighting their potential as a complementary resource in practices of promotion and recovery of biopsychosocial well-being.;"Neurodevelopmental disorders; Family support; Self-Care; "

• Biological practices, particularly acupuncture, were effective in managing pain, hot flashes, fatigue, and insomnia.
• Nutrition: Diets rich in vegetables, fruits, grains, and low in red meat, sugar, and alcohol were associated with better outcomes. However, natural diets and the use of supplements such as vitamin C, green tea, and turmeric showed limited scientific evidence.";In addition to conventional and pharmacological treatments, integrative medicine can be a significant ally in reducing pain, decreasing the incidence of psychological outcomes, and enhancing immune response.

";First, we will analyse the specifications of the territory and the design of Farol as a social business and its first strategies to enter the territory, including their theoretical references. We will then conduct a quantitative analysis of the impact of different territorial facilitation tactics on the activities carried out in this cooperation. Understanding the importance of combining data and experience in collective health, we will also rely on the performance autoethnography of both the manager of this social business and its territorial facilitator, as well as semi-structured interviews with professionals of the public health services.;"We observed that the territorial facilitation led Farol from 5 monthly group activities in collaboration with public health services in August 2024 - when collaborations started - to 15 in March 2025. The number of monthly participants in said activities rose from 72 to 199 during the same time. In this period Farol collaborated with 8 different public health services.
Analysing the experience of the territorial facilitation we noticed that first of all, it is important to have a social facilitator who is deeply related with the territory they are facilitating. Secondly, we also noticed that the managers of the public health services are overwhelmed with tasks, and if the dialogue is centered on them, organizing joint actions becomes very difficult and bureaucratic. Spreading the conversation among different professionals, always with the awareness of the managers seems to be a better strategy. Thirdly, we understood that health professionals tend to engage better in actions that are built in cooperation, rather than preset activities brought by the social business. Furthermore, the facilitation seems to flow better with health professionals when done face-to-face rather than in more formal channels, like email exchanges. Finally, in a very dynamic environment such as a primary care service like Primary Care Unities, it is important to be present, visiting the services frequently and talking to the professionals, users and the members responsible for the social control.";Our preliminary results show that it was necessary to combine different approaches when it comes to territorial facilitation of a social business in a new territory, especially when it requires engaging the public services in a vulnerable area.;"MTCI; public health care; Primary Health Care; territorial facilitation; vulnerable populations"

Anti-obesity drugs can cause significant side effects. Thus, the combination of Angelica keiskei+Panax ginseng extracts—has gained attention, considering its effects. Panax ginseng extract is well known for its anti-obesity, anti-hyperglycemic, and cardiovascular benefits. Similarly, Angelica keiskei extract has been shown to reduce adiposity and lower serum cholesterol, glucose, and insulin levels in diet-induced obese animals. Therefore, it is reasonable to hypothesize that combining Panax ginseng and Angelica keiskei extracts could yield even more favorable outcomes. Preclinical studies have shown that the active compounds in Angelica keiskei+Panax ginseng enhance mitochondrial biogenesis, leading to increased antioxidant production, improved glucose utilization, higher fatty acid oxidation, and browning of adipose tissue. Objective: This study aimed to determine whether the administration of a combination of Angelica keiskei+Panax ginseng in obese Wistar rats induces hemodynamic changes, and to assess the metabolic alterations. 
";"Fourteen male Wistar rats were used in this study (approved by the ethics committee, CEUA n?. 4320090622). At 50 days of age, all animals underwent a 12-week obesity induction protocol via a high-fat diet. Following this period, the animals were divided into two groups: the Obese Control Group (OB; n=7) and the Angelica Keiskei+Panax Ginseng Group (AK+PG; n=7). The AK+PG received six weeks of oral administration of a standardized extract containing both herbal components (Mitocondrin®) at dose 100 mg/kg, administered twice per week. The OB group received only an oral administration of the vehicle solution. Body composition was assessed by DXA (Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry), systolic blood pressure was measured using tail plethysmography and fasting blood glucose was recorded. After euthanasia, obesogenic parameters (body mass, relative tissue weight, and adiposity index), serum levels of inflammatory markers (IL-6, TNF-?, and IL-10), and serum NO levels were analyzed. ";"After six weeks of treatment, changes in body mass (?g) indicated that the AK+PG (6.44±1.08g,n=7) had significantly lower values compared to the OB (14.33 ±2.05g,n=7;p=0.02). Fat mass (g) was also reduced in the AK+PG (72.38±6.90g,n=7) compared to the OB (106.90±12.03g,n=7;p=0.044). For other obesogenic variables—including the relative weight of fat deposits (RET, MES, and EPI), adiposity index, fat percentage, and lean mass/fat mass ratio—a slight reduction in mean values was observed. Regarding fasting blood glucose levels, the AK+PG (-7.71±2.10mg/dl,n=7) exhibited significantly lower mean values compared to the OB (7.00±4.23mg/dl,n=7;p=0.009). Similarly, systolic blood pressure was significantly reduced in the treatment AK+PG (-28.51± 4.00mmHg, n=7) compared to the control (7.65 ± 6.64mmHg, n=7; p = 0.0005). Serum NO levels did not show significant differences, nor did serum levels of IL-6 and IL-10. However, the AK+PG exhibited significantly reduced TNF-? levels (482.83±129.40pg/ml, n=7) compared to the OB (1248.00±299.44pg/ml,n=7; p=0.033).

However, TCIM governance is complex, spanning multiple sectors and including many elements. To support technical cooperation and good TCIM governance worldwide, comprehensive analytic tools are needed.;Using a data-driven approach based on the ‘Framework’ method (Richie & Spencer), the authors constructed an analytic framework for characterizing the wide range of TCIM governance approaches across the Americas region. The framework was informed by policy analytic parameters for TCIM practitioners and practices proposed with respect to the civil law contexts of Latin America, and by analyses of TCIM’s common law, civil society and private sector governance in Canada and the United States.;"The framework classifies TCIM governance approaches according to their: a) domain (e.g., customary law, state governance and level within legal hierarchies, civil society, public sector); b) TCIM-related specificity (if a governance approach addresses TCIM only, or also other matters); c) TCIM type (e.g., Indigenous traditional medicine, ethnomedicine, complementary, etc.); d) health systems elements (e.g., service delivery, financing, workforce); e) intersectoral dimensions (e.g., biodiversity); and, f) TCIM aspect addressed (e.g., practitioners, products, reimbursement).";This work advances a classification model addressing TCIM governance’s unique features. The framework offers scholars, policy-makers and managers a tool for harmonizing analyses of TCIM governance across contexts. It may inform horizontal cooperation between jurisdictions and provide a meaningful basis for structuring a WHO-planned global TCIM governance repository.;"TCIM; Health Policy; Governance; health systems"

They are made from traditional Chinese medicinal materials through modern pharmaceutical processes such as extraction, concentration, drying and granulation. They have the advantages of being convenient to take, store and transport, and having stable quality. They are widely used in clinical practice and have a good market prospect. The study is designed to delve into frontline traditional Chinese medicine physicians' cognition and clinical application status of traditional Chinese medicine formula granules through qualitative interviews, so as to fill the research gap from clinical practice perspectives, thereby providing a basis for the application of formula granules.;"We conducted semi-structured, ~30-minute phone interviews with 10 traditional Chinese medicine physicians using purposive sampling. Selection criteria included: (1) Full-time TCM practitioners in public hospitals or community clinics; (2) Minimum 3 years of clinical practice experience; (3) Experience using TCM formula granules in clinical practice; (4) Voluntary participation. The interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and subsequently coded and thematically analyzed using NVivo.";During analysis, themes emerged across three domains. First, in terms of cognition, all interviewed physicians demonstrated a certain level of understanding of traditional Chinese medicine formula granules, and 70% of them primarily acquired initial knowledge through hospital introductions. Second, regarding clinical application, the frequency of doctors' application was mostly less than 50%, with convenience being the primary consideration. They acknowledged the convenience, stable quality and storage advantages of formula granules compared to traditional decoction pieces. However, they also mentioned challenges such as higher costs and the absence of clear standards for dosage conversion between formula granules and decoction pieces. In terms of efficacy, 30% of physicians considered formula granules to be comparable to decoction pieces, with mixed usage in a minority of cases. Some pointed out the superiority of formula granules in specific clinical scenarios, such as acute conditions. Physicians believed that formula granules would impact decoctions pieces (60%), but both would develop in parallel. Third, concerning future prospects, physicians generally expressed a desire for reduced costs (80%), standardized dosage conversion (50%) and enhanced scientific research (40%).;This study conducted in-depth qualitative interviews with frontline traditional Chinese medicine physicians to investigate their cognition, clinical application, and future prospects regarding traditional Chinese medicine formula granules. By exploring the developmental prospects of formula granules, the research provides crucial evidence for advancing clinical utilization of formula granules. Furthermore, it proposes actionable recommendations to optimize their implementation in clinical settings.;"traditional Chinese medicine formula granules; qualitative analysis; physician perceptions; clinical application"

Studying the effects of listening on connectedness and wellbeing by mixed-methods.;In our fast-paced society, very few people take the time to listen to others. The unfulfilled essential need of being heard has far-reaching consequences, such as loneliness and the associated mental and physical illnesses. We are interested in whether open-minded and value-free listening, offered in a secure space called the “Zuhörraum”, can influence the feelings of happiness, affect, and connectedness of the visitors (“tellers”) and “listeners”, in the moment. Furthermore, we will explore whether the feeling of connectedness will emerge and may partly drive the beneficial effects.;A mixed-methods design is used, meaning 1) quantitative questionnaires to evaluate happiness (single item), affect (affect grid), and social connectedness (inclusion of the other in the self scale, IOS) by tellers and listeners (n?185 in August 2025), as well as socioeconomic factors and other covariates. In addition, a survey pre- and post-implementation of the “Zuhörraum” intends to assess changes in terms of the above-mentioned determinants in persons living in the area surrounding the “Zuhörraum”. 2) A total of 12–15 microphenomenological interviews à 60 – 90 min. are conducted with “tellers”, recorded, transcribed and completed including observed gestures.  By applying this method, we will assess the perceived feeling of connectedness as experienced during the so-called “listening hour” (approximately 45 min in the room).   For this purpose the microphenomenologically-trained interviewer, evokes the lived experience through memories of emotional moments, and perceptions in order to receive a precise description on the feeling of connectedness. The ethics vote was obtained from the ethics committee of the University Witten/Herdecke (no. 329/2024).;Preliminary results from the “Zuhörraum” suggest increases in happiness and connectedness in “tellers” (N=9) and “listeners” (N=10), visiting the room. The average difference considering both “tellers” and “listeners” before and after the “Zuhörraum” showed an increase of 0.7 ±  1.0 points for happiness and 1.5 ±  1.3 points for connectedness. Both measures were slightly higher in “tellers” as compared to “listeners”. The affect scale is more complex and remains for analysis after completion of the field phase (August 2025). Regarding the mixed – method approach we will apply qualitative interviews to explore the subjective feeling of “connectedness”. We expect a total data set of around N = 180 persons who provide quantitative data from the “listening room” and N = 15 participants providing microphenomenological data by August 2025.;The results of this study will show the health-related effects of the integration of a “listening room” “Zuhörraum” at an individual level. The findings may help to develop health-promoting measures to improve  connectedness and its functions, and thus counteract the increasing isolation and loneliness in society with all its related negative side effects for health.;"value-free listening; connectedness; Wellbeing; listening-room; contra isolation and loneliness"

Recognized for its medicinal properties, it has attracted global scientific interest aimed at validating its botanical relevance and the traditional knowledge surrounding its Integrative complementary medicine to health care. This study aimed to analyze, in a quantitative, qualitative, and descriptive way, the global scientific and technological production related to Uncaria tomentosa.;Using bibliometric analysis supported by artificial intelligence, data were collected from two major databases: Scopus (for scientific literature) and Lens.org (for patents). The search term “Uncaria tomentosa” returned 610 scientific articles published between 1985 and 2025, and 1,332 patents registered from 1982 to 2025. The results highlight the United States as an expressive contribution in both scientific and technological domains, with 725 patent filings. Other prominent countries involved in recent research include Brazil, China (130 patents), India, Poland, and Spain. Notably, Brazil leads in academic output, with 785 published articles, and maintains active collaboration with Peru, particularly in the Southwestern Amazon. Interest in the species has significantly grown since 2005, especially in the U.S.;The pharmacological potential of Uncaria tomentosa herbal is of considerable importance to global public health. Studies and patents have associated it with treatments for cancer, Alzheimer’s disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and inflammatory conditions—all high-impact, high-cost illnesses, particularly for public health systems like Brazil’s SUS. Roughly 55% of the studies analyzed medicinal potential. From a technological standpoint, patent classifications follow the International Patent Classification (IPC) codes, primarily in categories linked to human health and nutrition: A61K (medical preparations), A23L (food), A61P (therapeutic compounds), A23V (nutrition), and A61Q (cosmetics). The top patent-holding companies include Metaproteomics LLC, Optigenex Inc., Cognitive Clarity, Lipotec S.A., and Valensa International. The Journal of Ethnopharmacology is the most prominent journal for academic publications on the species, with 36 articles. In Brazil, the access and use of genetic resources and traditional knowledge are regulated under Law No. 13,123/2015.;The species is found across the Amazon, its ethnobotanical origin is more frequently linked to Peru, where structured and legalized production already exists. Uncaria tomentosa is a liana that relies on tall, mature trees to reach sunlight, making it highly dependent on intact forest ecosystems. Unsustainable harvesting and lack of proper management plans pose serious risks to its survival, potentially leading to a tragedy of the commons scenario. Given its ecological, pharmacological, and economic relevance, increased investment is needed in collaborative research between scientific institutions, traditional communities and companies. Public funding—especially from international agencies and Brazilian institutions such as the State Research Support Foundations (FAPs)—should prioritize studies focused on the plant’s ecological, ethnopharmacological, phenological, phytochemical, clinical, and genetic dimensions, promoting both conservation and sustainable innovation.;"Amazon; Cat’s Claw; Uncaria tomentosa; herbal medicine; Brazil"

Biofield Therapies (BTs) such as Therapeutic Touch and Reiki are non-invasive complementary interventions proposed for the management of these symptoms. This systematic review and meta-analysis synthesizes the most current evidence on their effectiveness for these outcomes in postoperative care.;"A systematic search was performed in PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane databases in August 2025. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing BT to standard care or sham control in postoperative adults were included. Primary outcomes were pain intensity and anxiety intensity. The risk of bias assessment (using the Cochrane RoB 2 tool) were performed independently by two reviewers.
According to the PRISMA flowchart, eight RCTs were included. One study contributed data for both outcomes, resulting in six studies for the pain meta-analysis (n=477) and three studies for the anxiety meta-analysis (n=296). Pooled estimates were calculated as Standardized Mean Differences (SMD) using random-effects models.";"The meta-analyses revealed a strong contrast between outcomes. For postoperative anxiety, the pooled estimate showed a large, clinically relevant reduction favoring BTs, although it did not reach conventional statistical significance (SMD = -1.18, 95% CI: -3.78 to 1.41; p = 0.189). Crucially, the analysis revealed no heterogeneity (I2 = 0%, p = 0.633), indicating a consistent direction of effects across studies. For postoperative pain, the pooled effect was trivial and nonsignificant  (SMD = 0.09, 95% CI: -0.84 to 1.03; p = 0.845). This result was characterized by extreme and statistically significant heterogeneity (I2 = 99.6%, Q = 2396.02, p < 0.001; ?2 = 3.96).";"The efficacy of BT is highly outcome-specific. Although a precise and significant overall effect on pain was not found due to extreme and unexplained heterogeneity across studies, the therapies show a consistent and promising signal for reducing postoperative anxiety. The findings for pain suggest that the effect is highly context-dependent, necessitating research on specific effect modifiers rather than the overall average effect. For anxiety, future research should prioritize larger clinical trials with sufficient statistical power to confirm the potential benefit suggested by current consistent evidence. BT should not be dismissed as ineffective; instead, the focus should shift to identifying for whom and under what conditions it
is most effective.";"Biofield Therapies; Postoperative; Anxiety; Pain"

In addition, up to 80% of patients express their desire regarding complementary and integrative treatment. The CCC-Integrativ study developed, implemented and evaluated a patient-centered, interprofessional and evidence-based complementary and integrative health (CIH) counseling program for oncology patients at four Comprehensive Cancer Centers (CCC) in Baden-Wuerttemberg, Germany. The present study evaluates the impact of this counseling on self-efficacy, depression and fatigue.;We conducted a multicenter controlled naturalistic implementation study. Cancer patients received three tailored CIH counseling sessions within 3 months, of which at least the first counseling was conducted by an interprofessional team of physicians and nurses. Patients completed validated questionnaires before the first session (T1) and immediately after the 3-month intervention period (T2). Outcomes included self-efficacy (SES6G), depression (PHQ-9) and fatigue (EORTC-QLQ-FA12). Data were analyzed using linear mixed models (LMM).;"The study included n=1128 oncology patients (control group n=443, intervention group n=685) with various tumor types and stages within an outpatient setting. Two thirds (75.7%) were female. The results for self-efficacy in SES-6G showed a statistically significant time x group interaction effect (F(2,1848)=3.084; p=0.046) from T1 to T2 with a difference in difference (DiD) of 0.25 points and a weak effect size of d=0.125. For depression (PHQ-9), the model also revealed a statistically significant time x group interaction effect (F(2,1859)=6.194; p=0.002). The estimated DiD between control and intervention group regarding the change from T1 to T2 was -0.82 [95% CI: -1.35; -0.29] points in favor of the IG with a weak effect size of d=0.185. The EORTC-QLQ-FA12 showed a statistically significant interaction between time and the study groups (F(2, 1859)=6.194, p<0.002). The estimated DiD regarding the change between T1 and T2 was -3.57 [95% CI: -6.13; -1.01] points in favor of the IG with an effect size of d=0.169. ";Our study demonstrates that tailored, evidence-based interprofessional CIH counseling can significantly improve self-efficacy, reduce depressive symptoms, and alleviate fatigue in cancer patients. This integrative approach shows promise in managing distressing cancer-related symptoms while concurrently meeting the high patient demand for CIH treatment.

It is the most common neurological condition among young adults. MS is characterized by inflammatory processes in the brain and spinal cord, as well as the degeneration of myelin – the protective sheath that insulates nerve fibers and facilitates the transmission of electrical impulses. Currently, there is no cure for MS. This incurability underlines the importance of symptom management and efforts to prevent disease progression. This circumstance increases stress levels for MS patients – often referred to as the “burden of disease” – which may, in turn, trigger relapses. Patients often report that stressful life events exacerbate their symptoms. Science-based lifestyle change interventions, such as MBSR programs, are promising approaches. Studies show that MBSR and relaxation training are effective in reducing anxiety, depression, and stress in patients with MS. Regular physical exercise has beneficial effects even in individuals with pre-existing disabilities and can positively impact low-grade inflammation. Moreover, diet and nutrition can be health-promoting factors. Social, emotional, and cognitive factors, including gratitude, acceptance, and self-compassion, have received little attention in the scientific debate on MS treatment. Consequently, there is a significant research gap in integrative medicine in MS treatment and care. 

The aim of this study is to identify the resources and self-help strategies currently used by individuals with MS and to explore their needs and perspectives regarding integrative medicine.";We conducted a focus group in March 2025 with six individuals with MS and one neurologist as well as an additional interview with a content expert in July 2025 to identify areas where support is needed but not currently addressed by conventional medicine. The focus group and the interview were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using Phenomenological Inquiry and the software MAXQDA.;"Patients experience a reduced quality of life due to a wide range of symptoms, including fatigue, spasticity, disability, anxiety, and cognitive impairment. These symptoms can lead to social isolation, loneliness, absenteeism from work, early retirement, and increased stress levels. The latter not only affects overall well-being but is also influenced by – and can influence – the course of the disease.
Four key areas emerged, highlighting the need for self-help strategies, as well as knowledge, training, and specialized courses. The four areas are behavior, exercise, relaxation, and nutrition. Behavior includes, for example, self-help strategies, gratitude, setting boundaries, standing up for oneself, spending time in nature, communication, stress management and maintaining a social network. Exercise encompasses sports, strength training, and walking. Relaxation includes meditation, mindfulness practices, and moving meditations such as Qigong or yoga. Nutrition involves an anti-inflammatory diet, a vegan diet, and knowledge about a healthy gut microbiome.

The focus group and content expert interview revealed the unmet needs of individuals living with MS in areas not currently addressed by conventional medicine.";These findings highlight the need to incorporate integrative medicine in the treatment of multiple sclerosis.;"Multiple sclerosis; Integrative Medicine; Mindfulness; qualitative research; stress reduction"

Recent advances in quantum biology and integrative biophysics, under the umbrella of energy medicine, have introduced scientific models and evidence that can help reinterpret TCM from a contemporary scientific perspective. This study aims to integrate three energy domains: the geomagnetic field (GMFD), the quantum field (QFD), and the human biofield (HBFD) as epistemological foundations that support an energy continuum and promote dialogue between modern science and ancestral traditions.;"A narrative review was conducted based on scientific literature published between 2005 and 2025, retrieved from indexed databases (PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science) and gray literature sources (Google Scholar).

Thematic synthesis was employed to identify convergent mechanisms and epistemological linkages across domains.";"Quantitative and experimental studies demonstrate significant effects of the activity of these three energetic domains on different scales within the human organism. Findings related to the GMFD include: neurophysiological modulation through human magnetoreception, with alpha-band desynchronization (p < 0.05); autonomic regulation under ultra-low frequency geomagnetic oscillations (0.0033–0.04 Hz) and autonomic rhythms (r = 0.46, p < 0.01); significant reductions in leukocyte (–17.5 cells/mm³ per IQR increase in IMF, p < 0.001) and neutrophil counts associated with geomagnetic disturbances (Kp index); and impacts on fetal development, with increases in head circumference before 24 weeks (? = 0.04, p < 0.05) and reductions thereafter (? = –0.25, p < 0.01). Quantum biological processes (e.g., coherence, tunneling, and chromophore-based magnetoreception) and Biofield Therapies provided complementary evidence for the energetic continuum within the QFD and HBFD, respectively, consistent with the conceptual attributes of Qi.";The integration of these energetic domains provides an innovative epistemological model aligned with the fundamental principles of TCM. This synthesis contributes to an evidence framework that supports the scientific legitimacy of TCM and its inclusion in integrative health approaches.;"Qi; biofield; quantum biology; Traditional Chinese Medicine; geomagnetic field"

The study was approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee (REC-IOC/Fiocruz) under Certificate of Presentation of Ethical Appraisal - CAAE number: 45637621.6.0000.5248. Let us conduct a literature review on the effect of ICHP on children and young people in order to construct a guide to ICHP. We carried out a case study taking as object the Project 'Children Sun of Tomorrow -CST', carried out at the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation. We used documentary research to collect data from the perspective of Health Promotion and Education of ICHP with ArtScience. The CST project was carried out at Horto Fiocruz in 2018 with 80 participants and activities aimed at children and adolescents aged 8 to 15 years, their families and educators from social projects supported by Fiocruz, in areas with high violence in Rio de Janeiro (communities of Manguinhos, Complexo do Alemão, Cidade de Deus). The project carried out activities in a circuit of ICHP in Reiki, Tai Chi Chuan, Breathing, Meditation and Yoga stations, complementing with Environmental Education, ArtScience. We analyze the perception of positive and negative feelings before, during, and after the activities through the collection of words and the construction of a Metaformation, an approach that uses symbolic elements. Using the 13 cognitive categories promoting creativity (CCPC), the potential of ICHP to promote creativity was analyzed.;Our results showed that ICHP promoted positive feelings and well-being in the educational dynamics, as well as were able to promote creativity, and could facilitate innovations in teaching.;The teaching of ICHP for self-care, health and well-being of children and adolescents from areas exposed to violence has contributed to the Culture of Peace and can be designed for health promotion.

To demonstrate the advances of these medications in Brazilian regulation, this work will describe, in a timeline, the importance and impact of each new published resolution related to the dynamized medications, discussing the historical context, in addition to comparing the current legislation with the international regulatory standards defined by the FDA and EMA.;"The work adopts a qualitative approach, using bibliographic review instruments and document analysis. The present paper consulted public legal databases (ANVISA; VISALEGIS; FDA; EMA; EUR-Lex). Regarding the databases for the bibliographic review, scientific articles and journals were used with the objective of adding historical context to the discussion of the regulatory process for dynamized medicines. As for the legal public databases, the ANVISA 'legislation consultation' page was used to access the updated regulations on the legal processes for dynamized medicines.";The legal recognition of dynamized medicines in Brazil began in 1965 with Decree nº 57.477 and it received various updates with the Collegiate Board Resolutions of ANVISA (RDCs) nº 139/03, RDC nº 26/07, RDC nº 238/18, and RDC nº. 721/22. The updates established greater parameters for the production, distribution, and use of dynamized medicines in a safe and authorized manner based on the regulations imposed by the legislation regarding registration/notification, registration renewal, and post-registration changes. Furthermore, these advancements legally introduce anthroposophic and anti-homotoxic medications, which contribute to expanding the legal framework for dynamized medicines in Brazil. In comparison with International Legislation, Brazilian Legislation presents a greater level of detail and distinction of anthroposophic and anti-homotoxic medicines, while European Legislation (European Directive 2001/83) does not mention these medicines in its text and the American legislation (FD&C Act, 1938) considers that dynamized medicines fall under the category of 'new drugs' and that any new drug that fails to prove its effectiveness will be considered an 'unapproved new drug'. These factors contribute to international manufacturers of dynamized medicines having difficulty in fitting their products into current legislation.;After more than 50 years since the legal recognition of homeopathic medicines in Brazil, the legislation has received updates to better classify dynamized medicines for their registration/notification. When compared to the legislation of other countries, Brazilian legislation has been able to distinguish between homeopathic, anthroposophic, and anti-homotoxic drugs, a regulatory advance that is still evolving in the rest of the world.;"Homeopathy; Dynamized Medicines; Registration and Notification of Dynamized Medicines; homeopathic medicines; "

Brief therapeutic strategies that are feasible in health services with limited resources are essential to promote comprehensive and ac-cessible care. In this context, Interpersonal Nursing Theory, combined with mindfulness-based practi-ces such as conscious breathing, has shown promising potential in managing anxiety among individu-als with substance use disorders.;This mixed-method feasibility study employed standardized tools to assess anxiety (GAD-7) and pat-terns of substance use (ASSIST), along with semi-structured interviews to explore the acceptability, demand, implementation, and practicality of the intervention.;Participants demonstrated a significant reduction in anxiety scores at the end of the intervention. They also reported increased body awareness, improved sleep quality, and decreased urgency to use psychoactive substances. The intervention was considered feasible and practical, with 61.54% of par-ticipants utilizing the techniques offered. It was also rated as easy to implement and well-accepted by participants. These findings suggest that conscious breathing, even when applied in brief sessions, can have a meaningful clinical impact on anxiety symptoms and substance use behavior. Integrating min-dfulness practices into brief interventions in substance use contexts represents a promising innovation, particularly for mental health and primary care settings. Conscious breathing, as a tool for emotional regulation, may enhance personal autonomy and reduce relapse triggered by anxiety. The study highlights the need for further research with larger samples and more rigorous designs, such as ran-domized controlled trials, to consolidate this approach as a component of public mental health strate-gies.;The brief intervention using conscious breathing proved to be a viable, accessible, and effective strate-gy for managing anxiety in individuals who use psychoactive substances. Its good acceptability and low operational cost point to a scalable solution for expanding mental health care services. Consolida-ting this practice may contribute significantly to relapse prevention and the promotion of autonomy among service users.;"Substance-Related Disorders; Anxiety; Primary Health Care; Mindfulness"

Key concepts–such as knowledge diversity, evidential pluralism, decoloniality, and epistemic justice–needed to understand the specificities of incorporating TCIM in the EIDM process will be reviewed with reference to the principles of evidence-based medicine. Illustrative examples of EIDM in TCIM from across the globe will showcase the range of knowledge approaches, forms of evidence, and policy interventions that address key problems of public health relevance.  ;Building on the WHO´s existing model of EIDM and informed by the work of Nugruho and colleagues, the authors developed a Trifocal Model of EIDM. The model is designed to account for the diverse forms of evidence needed in the real world to make people-centred, culturally-responsive, and contextually-appropriate clinical and policy decisions. The model was tested using a series of TCIM-focused case studies from across all six WHO global regions.;The three forms of evidence highlighted in the Trifocal Model are: Research Evidence, Expert Evidence and Community Evidence. These categories align with the three pillars of evidence-based medicine, but account more explicitly for TCIM knowledges, non-statistical research paradigms, and a range of marginalized perspectives often unconsidered in decision-making. The TCIM case studies highlight the multiple ways in which each of these forms of evidence may be used in contextually-relevant ways to inform policy and practice. ;The Trifocal Model, which responds to long-standing calls for more epistemically-inclusive and socially-just decision-making models, has the potential to be applied not only to TCIM contexts, but more broadly in health decision-making.  Further research will be needed to explore the model’s applications, including how decision-makers may navigate the tensions arising between different knowledges and evidentiary perspectives.;"Evidence-Informed Decision Making; Health Policy; TCIM; Evidential Pluralism; Epistemic Justice"

This fragmented perspective often neglects the subjective, social, cultural, and identity-based dimensions of women’s health experiences. Traditional, Complementary, and Integrative Medicine (TCIM) emerges as a field with the potential to challenge these reductionist logics by fostering more integral, sensitive, and diversity-oriented care models. This study aimed to analyze how TCIM is represented in scientific production on women’s health, identifying hegemonic trends, silences, and counter-hegemonic possibilities for reconfiguring care practices.;A scoping review was conducted following the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) methodology, with searches performed in ten national and international databases, covering publications without language or time restrictions. A total of 2,474 articles were identified, of which 1,079 met the eligibility criteria for addressing TCIM in the context of women’s health. The analytical process was guided by Cultural Studies, using an expanded Circuit of Culture model that incorporated six analytical dimensions: representation, production/counter-production, consumption, identity, regulation, and sensoriality. This framework enabled a critical and contextualized reading of the discourses produced around TCIM and women’s health, examining the tensions between different rationalities of care and knowledge production.;"The analysis revealed that most scientific production focuses on TCIM practices related to the pregnancy-puerperal cycle and menopause, reinforcing a fragmented and biologically centered view of women’s health. There is a strong emphasis on therapeutic efficacy, clinical outcomes, and physiological parameters, with TCIM often framed as complementary techniques to biomedical care, validated through hegemonic scientific protocols. This predominance reflects a broader alignment with market-driven and biomedical rationalities.
However, within the reviewed literature, approximately 6.1% of the studies presented broader, critical perspectives that questioned biomedical centrality and incorporated discussions on autonomy, therapeutic bonding, culturally situated care, and ancestral knowledge. These studies represent counter-hegemonic approaches that highlight TCIM as a field capable of expanding care practices toward more subjective, relational, and integral dimensions of women’s health. The findings underscore the strategic role of TCIM as a space of epistemological dispute and potential for reconfiguring care models historically shaped by biomedical reductionism.";The study highlights the need to broaden the epistemological foundations guiding women’s health care and research. It reinforces the importance of incorporating plural, culturally sensitive, and contextually grounded knowledge systems into scientific production on TCIM. By exposing the limitations of biomedical paradigms and recognizing alternative epistemologies, this review contributes to advancing cognitive justice and promoting more integral and equity-oriented care practices for women’s health. Future research should prioritize frameworks capable of capturing the complexity, diversity, and symbolic dimensions inherent to TCIM and women’s health care.;"Women’s Health; Complementary Therapies; culture"

In Brazil, the religious healing practice performed by traditional local blessing-givers is an example of folk medicine that operates within two interrelated domains of socio-cultural life: (i) the religious domain, in which prayer is regarded as a healing instrument, and (ii) the healthcare domain, where healing rituals aim to contribute to patients' physical well-being. Since integrative and complementary practices are officially recognized within the Brazilian Unified Health System, this study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and legitimacy of blessing as a complementary therapy in Brazil.;A qualitative, interview-based study was conducted in 2024 in the metropolitan area of Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil, following approval by a research ethics committee (CAAE 79050524.0.0000.0315). The study included blessing-givers (n = 5), patients (n = 10), physicians (n = 5), and a Catholic priest. Participants were identified using a snowball sampling method, in which interviewees referred other potential participants. Semi-structured interviews were conducted and recorded with participants’ consent. The data were transcribed and analyzed using Bardin's thematic content analysis and textual analysis with IRaMuTeQ (version 0.8 alpha 7).;Interviews with blessing-givers and patients revealed that blessing is perceived as a voluntary practice rooted in a recognized spiritual gift, in which prayers are used to seek divine intervention for healing. Physicians acknowledged that traditional medicine does not invalidate folk healing practices, considering blessing as part of the spiritual dimension of healthcare. According to the priest, the Catholic Church accepts blessing as long as it aligns with faith principles and promotes both spiritual and community well-being.;This study challenges the notion of rejection and marginalization of non-scientific health practices. Our findings indicate that blessing is a valid and effective complementary practice, potentially contributing to the connection between spirituality, health, and integrative medicine in Brazil.;"Complementary Therapies; Integrative Healthcare; Religious healing"

However, selecting the most appropriate combination for each individual remains challenging. This study aimed to develop and evaluate a stratified care algorithm based on the assessment of individual homeostatic capacity using electrodermal activity (EDA).;"We evaluated 150 participants using a proprietary EDA method, which measures physiological stability across biologically active zones. Functional testing involved bioresonance stimulation using a specialized diagnostic and therapeutic hardware-software system. Based on the degree of EDA stability, participants were stratified into five groups: from group 1 with very high stability to group 5 with very low stability.
Each group was assigned tailored therapeutic strategies involving either integrative medicine alone or in combination with conventional medical care.";"Groups 1 and 2: Demonstrated strong homeostatic resilience. These individuals experienced symptom relief with integrative methods alone, such as bioresonance therapy, manual techniques, and lifestyle adjustments, typically within one to three sessions.
Group 3: Often presented with acute-phase illness. These patients required additional diagnostics and acute care, with optimal outcomes observed using multidisciplinary integrative approaches.
Groups 4 and 5: Exhibited impaired homeostasis, often with diagnosed chronic conditions under conventional care. Combined treatment strategies that integrated traditional and conventional medicine were most effective in improving health and function.
A 15-year longitudinal observational study on low back pain patients further validated the stratification model. Treatment outcomes consistently correlated with EDA-based group assignment, supporting the utility of this approach in clinical decision-making.";Preliminary assessment of homeostatic stability via EDA offers a practical, non-invasive method for guiding personalized integrative medicine.

However, when anxiety symptoms are severe and persistent, it can be potentially harmful.
With regard to health professionals, especially nurses, anxiety is a problem that has become more prevalent. It is therefore necessary to provide interventions to control anxiety in this population, since it is a necessary part of the workforce and care in the health system. 
Anxiety symptoms can be managed in a number of ways. One of these options is complementary and alternative medicine , which seeks to promote and prevent health. The practice of mindfulness is increasingly studied in academic research and has become popular. Mindfulness includes intentionally focusing attention on one's own thoughts, feelings, physical sensations and environment. The practice can be recommended for the management of anxiety symptoms by directing attention to the present moment, breaking patterns of anxious thinking and excessive worry about the future. The aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness of mindfulness for managing anxiety symptoms in nursing staff and stress as a secondary outcome.
";A systematic review with meta-analysis following the recommendations of the JBI. The databases searched were MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, CINAHL, Web of Science, Scopus and Psycinfo. The search was carried out in October 2022. Independent reviewers used standardized methods to search, screen and code the included studies. Data meta-analysis was performed using random effects models. Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) was used as an approach to assess the quality and certainty of evidence in research studies.;The review examined the effectiveness of mindfulness on nursing staff in 13 studies. The meta-analysis revealed a statistically significant decrease in anxiety and stress after treatment, with an average reduction of 0.36 in anxiety and 0.48 in stress. The results emphasizes the possibility of mindfulness  being an effective intervention to the management of anxiety and stress in nursing staff. However, the studies analyzed presented limitations in the design and sampling in the development of the intervention, which impact the conclusive statements about the effectiveness of mindfulness and the generalization of the results.  ;The implications to the nursing field involve adopting evidence-based research and practices to improve the well-being and quality of life of nursing professionals, as well as strengthening the evidence base surrounding mindfulness interventions in nursing practice. This may lead to changes in healthcare policies , care practices, and recognition of the importance of nurses' well-being for effective healthcare delivery. ;"Mindfulness; Systematic Review; Nursing; mental health"

However, conventional approaches often reproduce descriptive and methodologically neutral perspectives, limiting critical engagement with the symbolic, political, and epistemic dimensions of scientific production. This study proposes a scoping review model, following the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) guidelines, while critically tensioning each stage through the theoretical and methodological lens of Cultural Studies. Developed from empirical research on Traditional, Complementary, and Integrative Medicine (TCIM) and women’s health, the model integrates technical rigor with critical analysis of language, power, and representation, fostering contextualized and epistemologically plural interpretations of science as a culturally and politically situated practice.;The methodology articulates the scoping review model of the JBI with theoretical and methodological contributions from Cultural Studies. This represents a shift from scoping reviews as a merely descriptive exercise to a critical, ethical, and politically engaged process. Each stage—from the formulation of the research question to data analysis—is traversed by epistemological choices attentive to language, representation, and power dynamics. Data extraction involves the analysis of discursive elements such as vocabulary, legitimizing devices, silences, and narrative absences within scientific publications. The analytical process is guided by an expanded Circuit of Culture model, covering six dimensions: representation, production/counter-production, consumption, identity, regulation, and sensoriality.;"This methodological proposal expands the interpretative potential of scoping reviews by enabling critical readings of how certain forms of scientific knowledge are legitimized, silenced, or contested in the literature. It highlights key contributions such as the valorization of plural epistemologies, the inclusion of historically marginalized voices, and the displacement of methodological neutrality. 
The model proposes that each stage of the review process—from the formulation of the research question to data analysis—be traversed by ethical-political decisions, requiring active researcher engagement and fostering investigations that are more situated, critical, and sensitive to the symbolic and epistemic disputes that shape science as a cultural practice. Reflexivity thus emerges as a fundamental axis for confronting the epistemological silences and disputes inherent in knowledge production—an aspect of particular relevance, especially in the field of TCIM.";The scoping review model oriented by Cultural Studies reconfigures the investigative process by combining methodological rigor with critical, context-sensitive analysis. By recognizing scientific production as a symbolic and contested field, this approach enhances methodological reflexivity, expands analytical research possibilities, and contributes to knowledge production practices committed to cognitive justice and epistemological pluralism—especially in the field of TCIM.;"Review Literature as Topic; culture; Complementary Therapies"

The World Health Organization (WHO) recognizes medicinal plants as a fundamental therapeutic resource. In Brazil, this is institutionalized within the Unified Health System (SUS) through two key policies. The National Policy on Integrative and Complementary Practices (PNPIC, 2006) incorporates traditional practices into all levels of healthcare to promote a more holistic approach. Concurrently, the National Policy on Medicinal Plants and Herbal Medicines (PNPMF, 2006) aims to ensure safe, rational access to these resources by validating and integrating traditional knowledge.

Within this framework, the university extension project ""Shared Knowledge: Dialogues between Traditional Medicine and Collective Health"" operates. Developed by students at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ) in the Salles Netto Family Clinic, the project applies these national policies at the primary care level, seeking to honor traditional knowledge while strengthening community-health service bonds.";The project uses a participatory action research methodology centered on horizontal dialogue between students and the community. This approach is essential for documenting local perspectives and project impacts. Activities, including conversation circles and workshops, are held at the medicinal garden space at the Salles Netto primary care unit in Rio de Janeiro.;"The project's anticipated outcomes are analyzed through two interconnected axes. The first is Community Empowerment through Popular Health Education. Inspired by Paulo Freire's pedagogy (1987), which values dialogue and life experience, the project positions community members as active subjects in constructing their own health. This validates their traditional knowledge, moving beyond a top-down educational model and recognizing the power of popular wisdom (Diehl et al., 2021).

The second axis is the promotion of Rational Use of Medicinal Plants and Health Benefits. The project integrates traditional knowledge with scientific evidence to ensure safety and efficacy, a core goal of the PNPMF. This dialogue helps mitigate the risks of improper self-medication and promotes the use of plants to manage common chronic conditions, corroborating studies on the use of herbal medicine in primary care (Santos et al., 2023). The garden serves as a living laboratory where different forms of knowledge converge to improve quality of life."; This experience shows that community medicinal gardens are powerful tools for implementing national health policies at the grassroots level. They are dynamic spaces for health promotion, popular education, and strengthening community ties. The project reinforces that integral healthcare requires recognizing and integrating diverse forms of knowledge. Future steps include systematizing shared knowledge and conducting workshops on sustainable remedies to ensure the project's long-term impact.;"Primary Health Care; Community Participation; health promotion; Medicinal plants; "

It seeks to reflect on the importance of group work grounded in Analytical Psychology, utilizing traditional fairy tales.;This work demonstrates an intervention strategy with individuals experiencing severe psychological suffering, through group work using traditional fairy tales grounded in Carl Gustav Jung's Analytical Psychology (1875-1961). The proposal consists of four stages: Nigredo, Albedo, Citrinitas, and Rubedo, which guide the development of the therapeutic process using fairy tales. To this end, we conducted a study in primary healthcare at the Reference Center for Anthroposophic Medicine (CRMA), part of the Brazilian Unified Health System (SUS), in the city of São João del Rei, MG. The research was approved by the ethics committee of UFSJ, CAAE: 40240520.6.0000.5151. The research corpus comprises records of group experiences with traditional fairy tales, involving individuals with severe psychological suffering, during the years 2021, 2022, and 2023. These records include narratives documented in the researcher’s field diaries, as well as drawings and paintings created by the participants. The weekly group sessions with traditional fairy tales lasted three hours. The group’s systematic approach included a warm welcome, a ritual, reading a fairy tale, reflection, a snack, and an artistic activity. The collected data were subjected to analysis from a qualitative research perspective. The narratives and artistic works were categorized into four main axes: social adaptation, coping strategies for psychological suffering, social skills, and relationship skills. Based on these categories, a thematic analysis was conducted, allowing for a deeper understanding of how individuals interpret and face their experiences of psychological suffering, as well as their ways of social integration.;One of the main benefits we observed in the Traditional Fairy Tale Group was emotional support - an opportunity to receive emotional backing from other members of the group, to learn from others' experiences and coping strategies, thereby fostering social adaptation. It served as a space for peer interaction, an exercise in existence grounded in affective bonds that encourage individuals to engage in the social environment, with reverberations in family and community life.;When analyzing the stages of work with fairy tales, we noted the active involvement of participants in the therapeutic process, evidenced by their expanded reflection on their life experiences through dialogue with the images produced. Furthermore, we can infer that, in the Albedo phase, all unconscious mental manifestations are present, reinforcing the effectiveness of the amplification method proposed in Carl Gustav Jung's Analytical Psychology. This stage demonstrated how the integration of these manifestations contributed to a deeper understanding of the unconscious, strengthening the process of self-knowledge and social adaptation. The narrative analysis enabled exploration of nuances, emotions, and meanings attributed by each participant to their experiences, enriching the interpretation of the results.;"analytical psychology; traditional tales; group therapy; alchemy"

Although still scarcely implemented in this context, mindfulness-based interventions have shown robust evidence of effectiveness for health promotion. In this study, judges and staff members of the Regional Labor Court of Bahia (TRT-BA) participated in the “Mindfulness-Based Health Promotion” (MBHP) training. Objective: To assess the acceptability, feasibility, and effects of the MBHP training within the judiciary. ;"Methods: A longitudinal mixed-methods case study was conducted in 2025 with a subsample of 53 participants from seven cohorts of the MBHP program conducted at TRT-BA held since 2022, which included awareness-raising lectures, 12 hours of in-person training per cohort, and eight weeks of online follow-up (n = 167). Participants completed the SRQ-20, WHO-5, and ASAS-R scales pre- and post-intervention. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, and stratified analysis by sex and work modality) and inferential statistics (paired Student’s t-tests; Pearson’s correlation; Fisher’s r-to-z transformation; and McNemar’s test). Ethics approval for implementing MBHP with the Brazilian population was granted under protocol 43093115.8.0000.5505. ";Results/Discussion: The average age was 47 years (SD = 7.37). The MBHP reduced levels of mental distress and future risk, while improving well-being among the target population, with stronger effects observed among women in hybrid work settings. Mental health risk was negatively associated with well-being and self-care, and self-care was positively associated with well-being. These results were statistically significant (p < .05), except for the magnitude of correlation strength (p > .05). The MBHP proved acceptable and feasible, meeting recruitment (95.4%) and session attendance (88.3%) benchmarks, though the retention rate (51%) fell slightly short, indicating the need for future adjustments. ;Conclusions/Final Considerations: The implementation of MBHP demonstrated its acceptability, feasibility, and effectiveness in reducing mental distress and future risk, as well as in promoting well-being, especially among women in hybrid work settings. The initiative presents a promising model of institutional care with potential for replication across the Judiciary, fostering healthier and more productive work environments.;"Keywords: Mindfulness; mental health; Judiciary"

In parallel, mindfulness-based interventions and trial-based cognitive therapy have demonstrated evidence of effectiveness in promoting health and well-being across diverse populations. However, no records of such interventions exist within the judiciary. Objective: To examine the acceptability, feasibility, and effectiveness of individual and online interventions based on mindfulness and trial-based cognitive therapy (M-TBCT) to promote psychological well-being in the judiciary. ;Methods: Two sequential studies are being conducted. The first is a qualitative feasibility and acceptability study of the “Mindfulness Integrated with Trial-Based Cognitive Therapy” (M-TBCT) protocol, with a sample of 30 participants. Data collection is complete and under analysis. The second is an ongoing randomized controlled trial with 90 participants, 45 assigned to the M-TCP group and 45 to a waitlist control. The intervention is delivered individually and online, consisting of eight weekly one-hour sessions. Assessments occur at baseline (T0), post-intervention (T1), and six-month follow-up (T2). ;Results/Discussion: In Study 1, acceptability will be assessed through a self-report questionnaire, and feasibility will be measured via recruitment, session attendance, and retention rates. In Study 2, psychological well-being will be assessed using the WHO-5, mental health through the PHQ-9 (depression) and GAD-7 (anxiety), and self-care through the ASAS-R. Expected outcomes include reduced anxiety and depression, increased self-care, and sustained improvements at six-month follow-up. The study received ethics approval from the UNIFESP Research Ethics Committee (CAAE 73817423.3.0000.5505) and was registered in the Brazilian Clinical Trials Registry (REBEC) prior to data collection. ;Conclusions/Final Considerations: The implementation of M-TCP in the judiciary is expected to generate evidence supporting effective and cost-efficient interventions, aligned with NR-1, the Regulatory Standard mandating prevention of psychosocial risks and promotion of workplace health. The protocol may also strengthen interpersonal connections and work-family balance, with potential for expansion to other courts within the judiciary, as well as to other public and private institutions.;"Keywords: Mindfulness; mental health; Cognitive Therapy; well-being; Judiciary"

Its impact on health is through the biomedical model, which treats the body as an object without subjectivity and care as a commodity in dispute. Seeking to overcome this legacy, the National Policy for Healthcare for Indigenous Peoples (PNASPI) instituted Differentiated Care (AD), which recognizes different indigenous cultures as legacies that must be valued to ensure the continuity of knowledge, practices, care, and values ??in integration with the care practices offered by the Indigenous Healthcare Subsystem (SASI-SUS). The real challenge of AD is to transform the encounter between the biomedical practices of SASI-SUS and the Ancestral Sciences of Care for Indigenous Peoples into a productive and powerful crossroads, where different ways of doing science are mutually respected. For this to happen, it is essential to map and understand the care technologies of these peoples. In this context, the project ""Technologies of Indigenous Care: Participatory mapping of specialists in indigenous medicine in the State of Ceará"", developed in partnership by Fiocruz and DSEI-CE, maps specialists (midwives, shamans, and prayers). The initiative seeks to give practical meaning to AD, promoting the alliance of this knowledge with SASI-SUS and, crucially, subsidizing with information about the indigenous peoples of Ceará the Working Group on Indigenous Medicines (GT/MI), established by SESAI to create a national program.";Research began in June 2025 and will be completed in November 2025. Because of this, this work analyzes the impact of initial training and will present a preview of the results of the mapping interviews. To begin mapping activities, indigenous scholarship recipients were selected via a public notice. Following the selection a training course took place for selected indigenous researchers aiming to align their understanding of the project and the methodology for developing the activities. ;Eleven scholarship holders were selected to be indigenous mapping researchers. The training course was held in May 2025, with the presence of all scholarship holders, members of DSEI – CE and the project team. The course was designed as a training moment, focused on interaction between and among participants, from a dialogical perspective of knowledge construction. It included spaces on indigenous health, indigenous medicines and care technologies, addressed ways of mapping, presentation of the instruments to be used, practical time for scholarship holders to experience conducting interviews alongside people from the indigenous territory and a moment for planning activities.;The training course contributed to the leveling of the scholarship holders regarding the project and its methodology. With the development of the activities by the scholarship holders, it is expected that all interviews with midwives and specialists from the indigenous territories of the state of Ceará will be completed by December. The mapping will contribute to strengthen the SASI-SUS in Ceará, guiding the Specialized Care to be referenced by indigenous health specialists.;"Coloniality; Indigenous health; Differentiated Care"

Therefore, in Brazil, strategies aimed at training health professionals have been carried out with a view to expanding PICS/TCIM in the SUS. This research comes from a project carried out in partnership between the university, the city government of Niteroi (Rio de Janeiro) and the university support foundation, which has three main stages: mapping of health units, training professionals, and expanding PICS/TCIM in the municipality. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of PICS/TCIM training on the quality of life of health professionals in the municipality.
";"This is an observational, longitudinal and prospective study, which used the validated WHO-QoL-bref questionnaire to assess quality of life before training (time zero) and after 9 months of training (time 1). The training carried out during the study period were: reiki, yoga, circular dance, reflexology, aromatherapy and floral therapy. The study presents partial data obtained from 19 participants who signed a consent form. The score was presented as a percentage. The protocol was approved by a Brazilian Research Ethics Committee (CAAE 35883220.0.0000.5289).
";"This study presents the preliminary results concerning the four domains (physical, psychological, social relations and environment), as well as self-assessment, of the WHO-QoL-bref questionnaire, considering time zero and time 1. There was an increase in all the domains (physical: 68.03 to 70.11; psychological: 73.00 to 79.45; social relations: 65.25 to 78.70; environment: 64.6 to 78.4) and in self-assessment quality of life (65 to 70.55). In the results showed, the psychological, social and environmental domains stood out, which possibly reflects an improvement in the participating professionals' perception of their well-being and working conditions. In addition, the overall score of the questionnaire also increased from 68 to 72.95. 


";"Although the study has a limitation, due to the small number of participants, it is possible to observe that the PICS/TCIM training promoted a positive impact on the trained professionals, considering that many of them use these tools directed at self-care, promoting awareness of health care and how to deal with daily events. It is suggested that the improved quality of life of the professionals could lead to better care for SUS patients, with more effective service performance. Furthermore, it is suggested that more studies be carried out in the area in order to verify the effects of training for health professionals.

This complexity has led to a growing interest in integrative therapies (IT), such as Pranic Healing (PH), a non-invasive energy-based technique. Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of Pranic Healing as an adjunctive therapy for chronic pain management. ;This is a retrospective and cross-sectional study conducted between 2011 and 2013, involving 203 participants (both male and female), aged between 10 and 90 years, all experiencing symptoms of chronic pain. Pain intensity was assessed using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS). All participants underwent a PH session, seated one meter in front of the therapist. After identifying energy imbalances in the physical body, internal organs, and the 11 major chakras, advanced PH techniques and Pranic Psychotherapy were applied. The therapist used a transparent quartz crystal in one hand to remove imbalanced energy, and a quartz sphere in the other to enhance the absorption of vital energy. ;Results: A statistically significant reduction in pain was observed after a single PH session (p < 0.001), both in the overall sample and when analyzed by age group and gender (p < 0.001). Discussion: Preliminary results suggest the therapeutic potential of Pranic Healing for chronic pain relief, highlighting the need for further research with more rigorous methodological design. ;Conclusion: Pranic Healing proved effective in reducing chronic pain symptoms and may serve as a valuable complementary approach in integrative pain management strategies;"Chronic Pain; Integrative Medicine; Complementary and integrative practices; Energy therapies"

Thus, the inclusion of these therapeutic approaches in health systems around the world is widely recommended by the WHO. In Brazil, these therapies have been offered by the Unified Health System (SUS) since the 1980s and have a specific national policy, the National Policy for Integrative and Complementary Practices (PNPIC) since 2006, with expansion in 2017 and 2018, currently totaling 29 different therapeutic modalities. However, the absence of municipal and state policies hinders the development of their provision and contributes to their invisibility. In this context, we assume that specific municipal policies aimed at traditional and integrative care (CTI) can favor the organization and development of their provision in PHC services. In view of this, we carried out an action research (AR), the objective of which was to analyze the demands of the collective formulation process of a proposal for a Municipal Policy for Integrative and Complementary Practices (PMPIC), together with key actors.;The action research was conducted with 18 participants involved in the provision of these therapeutic approaches in the SUS, from six municipalities that are members of the Regional Health Department III (DRS III) of the state of São Paulo. Data were collected through documentary analysis of records from the year 2023, from a service-teaching-management integration working group, involved in the implementation of practices present in the PNPIC, in the SUS of their municipalities, and from eight workshops held in 2024. Data analysis followed Dick's (2002) proposal of confirmation and disconfirmation of data in action research, based on the dialectical process. It is worth emphasizing that a recent mapping in DRS III shows that of the 24 member municipalities, 20 offer in the SUS some practice present in the PNPIC.;"The results show that the process demands highlighted were strategies for the implementation of both the PICs and their municipal policy, aimed at: dissemination of information about the PICs and the municipal policy; the need for reports, indicators, and financial resources; access to and organization of flows; and demands for collective discussion spaces and SUS devices such as the Municipal Health Council and the National Council of Municipal Health Secretaries.";The creation of the PMPIC proposal reflected the desires, knowledge and local needs of workers, managers and civil society, in the writing of the policy they wish to see implemented, consolidating a legitimate, plural technical product anchored in the principles of the PNPIC. The moments of listening, critical analysis and collective validation confirmed the transformative potential of action research, promoting the empowerment of participants and strengthening the public sense of health care. The collective elaboration of the PMPIC proposal proved to be a political, transformative pedagogical path that rescues the political and humanized sense of promoting traditional and integrative care in the SUS.;"Integrative and Complementary Practices; Public policy; Action research; PHC; SUS"

Auricular acupuncture may represent a promising complementary strategy; however, evidence from controlled clinical trials remains limited. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of auricular acupuncture on the intensity of CINV in adults with cancer, compared to a sham intervention.";"This was a parallel (1:1) randomized controlled trial conducted at an oncology center in southern Minas Gerais, Brazil. Participants were randomized in blocks of six using an online tool and allocated into two groups. The intervention group received auricular acupuncture using mustard seeds applied to specific points related to nausea and vomiting. The sham group received black-painted cotton pieces affixed to auricular points unrelated to the condition under study, with inert stimulation. An acupuncturist with four years of experience administered five consecutive sessions in both groups.
The outcome assessed was the intensity of the worst sensation of nausea and vomiting, measured using the Morrow Assessment of Nausea and Emesis (MANE) scale at three timepoints: T1 (before the intervention), T2 (after five sessions), and T3 (fifteen days after the last session). Possible responses were: none, mild, moderate, and severe. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics (absolute and relative frequencies). The study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee (approval no. 5.688.449, CAAE: 60933422.0.0000.5142) and registered in the Brazilian Registry of Clinical Trials (ReBEC): RBR-5rp37x8.";"At baseline, severe nausea was reported by 46% of participants in the intervention group and 48% in the sham group; severe vomiting was reported by 26% in both groups.

In the context of auricular acupuncture for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, understanding the role of expectation can help minimize potential biases in clinical trials. However, this aspect remains understudied. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the association between patients’ expectations regarding the effectiveness of auricular acupuncture and the occurrence of nausea and vomiting.;"This was a secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial conducted at an oncology center in southern Minas Gerais, Brazil. One hundred patients with chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting were randomly allocated to one of two groups (1:1): the intervention group (auricular acupuncture using mustard seeds at specific points) and the sham group (simulated auricular acupuncture with stimulation at non-specific points). Both groups received five weekly sessions. Expectation of effectiveness was assessed prior to the intervention using the question: “Do you believe auricular acupuncture will influence your episodes of nausea and vomiting?” The association between expectation and the occurrence of nausea and vomiting was analyzed using descriptive statistics and Fisher’s exact test, with a significance level of 5%. The study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee (approval no. 5.688.449; CAAE: 60933422.0.0000.5142).";"Most participants reported believing in the effectiveness of auricular acupuncture (90.0%). In the intervention group, 86.0% of participants who believed in acupuncture reported nausea at baseline, and 52.0% at the final assessment.

In the sham group, among those who believed in acupuncture, 86.0% reported nausea at baseline and 82.0% at the final assessment. Among those who did not believe in acupuncture, 10.0% reported nausea at baseline and 8.0% at the final assessment.
When analyzed by group and timepoint, no statistically significant associations were found between belief in the effectiveness of acupuncture and the occurrence of nausea or vomiting at either baseline or final assessment (p > 0.05 for all tests). These findings highlight the importance of considering participants’ beliefs and expectations regarding interventions, particularly in clinical trials involving Integrative and Complementary Health Practices.";The findings suggest that although most participants reported positive expectations toward the intervention, no statistical association was found between these expectations and the clinical outcomes assessed.

Non-hormonal alternatives are needed for women with contraindications to hormonal therapy. Brassica oleracea contains glucosinolates, flavonoids, and sulforaphane with demonstrated wound-healing, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 10% Brassica oleracea glycolic extract cream versus standard vaginal moisturizer for GSM treatment.;Triple-blind, randomized, controlled clinical trial conducted at a quaternary university hospital. Inclusion criteria: postmenopausal women aged 50-65 years, amenorrhea ?3 years, FSH >25 IU/mL, estradiol <20 pg/mL, clinically diagnosed GSM. Exclusion criteria: Brassicaceae allergy, active infections, hormone use <3 months. Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive either 10% Brassica oleracea glycolic extract cream (n=22) or standard moisturizer (n=18). Intravaginal application every 72 hours for 12 weeks. Primary outcomes: Vaginal Health Index (VHI), Atrophy Symptoms Scale (ASS). Secondary outcomes: Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI), Women's Health Questionnaire (WHQ). Safety assessed through hepatic and renal function tests. Statistical analysis used Mann-Whitney and Fisher's exact tests (?=0.05). Ethics approval: CAAE 70147923.0.0000.0068.;"Mean age was 57.91±5.04 years (Brassica) vs 56.00±3.27 years (control). Brassica group showed significant VHI total improvement over time (baseline 16.70±4.49 to 18.22±3.99, p=0.0177) while control showed no significant change (p=0.2496). Between-group analysis revealed superior Brassica efficacy: VHI total difference 3.77±2.48 vs 1.05±3.9 (p=0.008), VHI secretion improvement (p=0.05). ASS total reduction was greater in Brassica group (-4.95±2.29 vs -3.33±2.02, p=0.049). FSFI showed significant Brassica improvements: satisfaction (p=0.016), arousal (p=0.032), lubrication (p=0.037), and pain reduction (p=0.038). No adverse events occurred; laboratory parameters remained stable.  The superior efficacy of Brassica oleracea compared to standard moisturizers aligns with its unique bioactive profile. Glucosinolates are converted to isothiocyanates like sulforaphane, which activate the Nrf2 pathway and inhibit NF-?B, reducing oxidative stress and inflammation in hypoestrogenic vaginal tissues. Unlike previous studies showing modest improvements with standard moisturizers, our formulation achieved clinically meaningful VHI increases (>3 points) and substantial ASS reductions. Regression analysis identified hysterectomized women and those with chronic symptoms as optimal responders, possibly due to enhanced tissue responsiveness to regenerative compounds. The 12-week intervention period may explain superior outcomes compared to shorter studies. Limitations include small sample size and baseline demographic differences between groups, though primary outcome measures were comparable. These findings suggest Brassica oleracea addresses both symptomatic relief and underlying tissue pathophysiology through tissue regeneration rather than temporary lubrication alone.";Vaginal moisturizer containing 10% Brassica oleracea glycolic extract is a safe and effective non-hormonal alternative for GSM treatment, significantly improving vaginal health, reducing atrophic symptoms, and enhancing sexual function in postmenopausal women.;"Genitourinary syndrome of menopause; Brassica oleracea; phytotherapy; Vaginal health; Sexual function"

";This study investigated the in vitro antiproliferative properties of water (W) and ethanol (Et) extracts from Kakadu plum (KP), Illawarra plum (IP), Davidson’s plum (DP), native currant (NC), and lemon aspen (LA) against the MCF7 breast adenocarcinoma cells. After treatment with the active extracts, flow cytometry and reactive oxygen species (ROS) assays were employed to assess the levels of apoptosis induction and ROS generation in the MCF7 cells, respectively. The active extracts were also evaluated for their antioxidant potential using the ABTS and CUPRAC assays. Additionally, antimicrobial susceptibility tests were performed on the extracts against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Candida albicans. Finally, the potential bioactive metabolites in the selected active extracts were analysed using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) driven metabolomics.;The results indicated dose-dependent antiproliferative (against MCF7 cells) and antioxidant (in the ABTS and CUPRAC assays) activities for the active extracts - KP-W, KP-Et, IP-Et, NC-W, NC-Et and LA-Et. Notably, the KP-W exhibited the lowest EC50 value of 0.20 µg/mL in the CUPRAC assay. All active extracts showed moderate antimicrobial activity against the tested pathogens. Moreover, KP-W, KP-Et, IP-Et, NC-W, NC-Et and LA-Et were found to induce apoptosis with a significant decline (p < 0.05) in the live MCF7 cell populations after 24 h of treatment, compared to the untreated control. However, these active extracts had no significant impact on the levels of ROS (p> 0.05) in the MCF7 cells, compared to the untreated control. The metabolomic identification revealed an abundance of tannin, flavonoids, and triterpenoid compounds as potential bioactive metabolites in the KP extracts, while NC extracts were rich in flavonoids, fatty acyl derivatives, carbohydrates, carboxylic acids and their derivatives, and alkaloid compounds.;The outcome serves as a foundation for future studies on these fruits as potential dietary and therapeutic interventions for breast cancer. Moreover, isolation and purification of active metabolites and assessing apoptotic protein expression levels using advanced assays are crucial in future studies. ;"Australian native fruits; MCF7 breast adenocarcinoma; antioxidant activity; antimicrobial activity; metabolomics"

Breath regulation is a foundational element across many traditional healing systems and has gained increasing attention in integrative medicine for its role in modulating the autonomic nervous system. Conscious breathing is known to impact heart rate variability, stress response, and emotional regulation. Practices like yoga and meditation incorporate intentional breath control to promote physiological balance. Indian classical dance, particularly Kuchipudi, shares parallels with such practices through its structured, rhythm-based movements synchronized with breath awareness.
Kuchipudi is a classical Indian dance form rooted in the ancient texts N??ya??stra and Abhinaya Darpana, which articulate detailed frameworks for gesture (mudra), expression (abhinaya), and movement (karana). Traditionally performed as a blend of dance, drama, and music, Kuchipudi uses hand gestures, facial expressions, rhythmic footwork, and bodily transitions to convey narrative and emotion. While primarily appreciated as a performing art, Kuchipudi also inherently involves physical activity, mental focus, emotional expression, and breath coordination—qualities that may render it a potential complementary mind-body practice.
Recent scholarship has begun to explore the therapeutic relevance of classical dance, examining its benefits in physical, psychological, and neurological domains. However, limited research exists on its direct impact on breath regulation as a measurable physiological outcome. This study addresses that gap by investigating the potential of Kuchipudi as a movement-based intervention that supports respiratory stability. 

This study aimed to assess the effects of a structured Kuchipudi dance session on breath rhythm and regulation, using biometric data to evaluate pre- and post-intervention changes.
";"Thirty female participants (aged 13–45) from a Kuchipudi dance school were recruited, each with prior training in basic postures, movements, and breathing patterns associated with the dance. A pulse oximeter was used to monitor beats per minute (bpm) before and after a guided 45-minute session. The session incorporated continuous movement sequences, including gestures, rhythmic footwork, and transitions performed with intentional breath awareness. The approach mirrored aspects of yogic movement therapy and aimed to align breath with bodily flow.
";"Post-intervention data revealed a measurable shift in participants’ breath-related physiological markers. While pre-session readings showed greater variability in bpm, post-session results indicated more stable, consistent breathing patterns. The observed changes suggest a shift toward autonomic regulation and a calming effect on the breath-heart connection. Participants also reported feeling more mentally centered and physically relaxed, although these were anecdotal and not formally measured.
";"This preliminary study provides evidence that structured sessions of Kuchipudi dance, when performed with focused breath awareness, may contribute to improved breath regulation. These findings highlight the potential of Indian classical dance as a therapeutic complementary movement-based intervention. Given its non-invasive, expressive, and engaging nature, Kuchipudi may offer a novel tool in integrative health approaches aimed at supporting respiratory, emotional, and neurological well-being. Further research with a larger sample size, control group, and broader physiological metrics (e.g., HRV, SpO?, cortisol) is recommended to substantiate these initial findings and explore its clinical relevance.

These foundational treatises articulate that the practice of classical dance enhances core strength, balance, concentration, and internal energy flow. Of particular interest is N?tya—the expressive component of dance combining facial expressions (Abhinaya) and gestures—which may activate emotional and cognitive circuits through intricate facial muscle engagement.

This main objective of the study is to investigate the potential therapeutic benefits of expressive acting in Indian classical dance (N?tya), focusing on its impact on emotional regulation and anxiety reduction.";A quantitative, quasi-experimental research design was adopted. The study recruited 50 participants (ages 16–50) from India and the USA who are currently undergoing Indian classical dance (Bharatanatyam) training. Participants practiced expressive acting through Abhinaya for 30 minutes daily over one month. Pre- and post-session stress and anxiety levels were recorded using standardized self-report questionnaires, including the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) and a custom mood regulation scale. The focus was to observe trends in self-perceived emotional states before and after each session.;Preliminary findings suggest a measurable reduction in anxiety and improved mood regulation among participants following the expressive movement sessions. Repetitive facial engagement, focused attention, and storytelling elements inherent in Abhinaya may activate parasympathetic pathways, aiding emotional catharsis and self-awareness. These effects mirror outcomes typically associated with movement-based and mindfulness therapies.;Abhinaya, as a structured and emotionally expressive component of Indian classical dance, offers potential as a complementary therapeutic intervention. It holds promise particularly for mental well-being, emotional regulation, and stress relief. Bridging ancient dance theory with modern health science, this research advocates for the integration of expressive movement practices into holistic therapeutic frameworks within complementary and alternative medicine.;"Indian Classical Dance; Facial Expression; complementary therapy; Bharatanatyam; Anxiety Reduction"

Phase 1 involved qualitative interviews with Traditional Health Practitioners (THPs) to explore their roles, practices, and perspectives on collaboration with allopathic professionals. Phase 2 consisted of a national quantitative survey of nurse educators to assess current inclusion and teaching practices of ATHKPs in nursing education. In Phase 3, findings from both phases were integrated and used to develop a competency-based framework through a consultative process involving stakeholders from traditional medicine, academia, and policy.;Findings confirmed the fragmented and informal inclusion of ATHKPs in nursing curricula, with no standardized content or competencies. The developed framework outlines key domains: foundational knowledge of traditional health systems, practical collaboration skills, and cultural humility. The framework is aligned with national nursing standards and aims to support the training of nurses who are both culturally competent and prepared to work in integrative health systems.;This framework offers a strategic response to global calls for integrating traditional knowledge into mainstream health professional education. It promotes culturally congruent care, strengthens collaboration between biomedical and traditional practitioners, and contributes to the broader goals of curriculum decolonization, health equity, and sustainable development.;"traditional medicine; Nursing Education; Curriculum Reform; Competency Framework; Africa"

The study aims to conduct a systematic review and network meta-analysis regarding TCIM therapies for treating mild/moderate acute COVID-19.;We systematically searched EMBASE (Elsevier), Medline (OVID), VHL TCIM database, Cochrane Central, Clinical Trials.gov, ICTRP as of March 22nd, 2024, and eight additional Chinese databases and four Korean databases for RCTs comparing TCIM intervention with another TCIM intervention, standard of care (SoC), placebo, or conventional medicine in participants with suspected, probable, or confirmed mild/moderate acute COVID-19. Reviewers worked in pairs and independently screened titles/abstracts and full text of all potentially eligible trials, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias for each outcome. We performed frequentist network meta-analyses and rated the certainty of the evidence for each outcome using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. We further grouped interventions from most to least effective.;"155 trials evaluating 142 TCIM therapies were eligible for review, of which 69 (45%) trials enrolling 18,627 patients met the analysis criteria of contributing at least 80 participants or 20 events to one intervention. All the following estimates come from direct evidence as networks were sparse. Compared with SoC alone, high to moderate certainty evidence showed that three TCIM add-on interventions reduced time to symptom resolution: Kovir capsule (-3.14 days, -3.67 to -2.61, high certainty); Lianhua Qingwen (-2.82 days, -3.14 to -2.50, high certainty); and honey and Nigella sativa (-3.00 days, -4.12 to -1.88, moderate certainty). Since 71% of eligible studies recruited participants at inpatient or isolation settings, we inferred admission to hospital outcome from the rate of conversion to severe cases. For patients at low risk of hospitalization, high to very low certainty evidence supported that there was little or no difference in admission to hospital between any TCIM intervention and SoC. For patients at moderate risk of hospitalization, Andrographis paniculata extract probably reduced admission to the hospital (-15 per 1000, -24.9 to 12.3, moderate certainty). All comparisons for admission to hospital in patients at high risk of hospitalization, and comparisons for mortality and mechanical ventilation were supported by only low or very low certainty evidence. Moderate to high certainty evidence showed that Lianhua Qingwen, Kovir capsule, COROPROTECT kit, and Shen Cao Gan Jiang did not result in an increase in adverse events leading to drug discontinuation; other TCIM interventions lack enough evidence to inform adverse events leading to discontinuation. Lianhua Qingwen was also effective in resolving fatigue and cough(moderate to high certainty); honey and Nigella sativa was effective in resolving fever; and Jinghua Jiedu was effective in resolving cough. ";"Kovir capsule, Lianhua Qingwen, and honey and Nigella sativa probably reduce the time needed to resolve symptoms of acute COVID-19; Andrographis paniculata extract probably reduces admission to hospital in patients at moderate risk of hospitalization. Independent replication of these findings is warranted. The effectiveness and safety of most TCIM interventions remain uncertain.";"traditional medicine; complementary medicine; Integrative Medicine; Non-severe COVID; non-severe acute Covid-19"

In response, we organized a virtual course presenting scientific evidence on brain function during meditative and religious practices. The course focused on issues such as faith, beliefs, and coping mechanisms for daily life.;The 90-day online course consisted of biweekly 150-minute classes. Each class was divided into a theoretical half, presenting scientific literature on Neuroscience, and a practical half, featuring a progressive meditation program. This program was designed to build anchors for the physical, vital, mental, and spiritual dimensions of human constitution. Participants (n=24) were evaluated using the WHOQOL-BREF and Spiritual Experience Index instruments before and three months after the course.;"Quantitative analysis showed no statistically significant differences between pre- and post-intervention measures. The overall WHOQOL-BREF score increased slightly from a mean of 41.08 (SD=8.26) to 42.21 (SD=8.44), but the change was non-significant (t(23)=?1.07, p=0.297). By domain, Physical health remained stable (Mpre=76.35, Mpost=76.50; t(23)=?0.09, p=0.932), Psychological scores decreased marginally (Mpre=73.10, Mpost=72.57; t(23)=0.30, p=0.764), Social relationships showed a non-significant decline (Mpre=67.71, Mpost=63.55; t(23)=0.75, p=0.462), and Environment also showed a decrease (Mpre=70.98, Mpost=66.68; t(23)=0.98, p=0.337). Clinical indicators, such as the number of diagnoses (Mpre=0.23, Mpost=0.13; t(21)=0.90, p=0.378) and the Charlson Comorbidity Index (Mpre=0.46, Mpost=0.13; t(21)=1.22, p=0.236), also did not differ significantly.
Despite the absence of statistically significant changes, qualitative focus group analysis revealed participants’ reports of increased well-being, better coping with daily stress, and a deepened spiritual experience. These findings highlight the importance of mixed-methods designs for capturing the nuanced impacts of contemplative practices.";The online course on Neuroscience and Spirituality effectively fostered improvements in self-perceived well-being and spiritual experience, even though standard psychometric scales did not capture statistically significant effects. This discrepancy underscores that the benefits of contemplative practices may be subtle and multidimensional, and that mixed-methods approaches are essential to fully assess their impact.;"Meditation; Spirituality; Neurosciences; mind-body therapies; Quality of Life"

Beyond the acute phase, a significant proportion of patients develop Post-Acute COVID-19 Syndrome (PACS), defined by persistent symptoms ?4 weeks after infection. Risk factors include severe acute illness, ICU admission, and underlying immune-metabolic imbalances. PACS overlaps clinically and mechanistically with chronic inflammatory, autonomic, and functional disorders, suggesting underlying neuroimmune-endocrine dysregulation. This explores the potential role of neural therapy in modulating these dysfunctions.;"A narrative review was conducted using PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar, targeting literature published between January 2020 and March 2024. The search strategy employed the terms: ""Post-Acute COVID-19 Syndrome,"" ""Long COVID,"" ""neurogenic inflammation,"" ""autonomic dysfunction,"" ""inflammatory reflex,"" ""vagus nerve stimulation,"" ""stellate ganglion block,"" and ""neural therapy.""
Studies were included if they provided data on PACS pathophysiology, autonomic imbalance, or clinical outcomes of neuromodulatory interventions using local anesthetics. Case reports with insufficient methodological detail or unrelated to autonomic regulation were excluded. A total of 136 articles were identified; 78 met inclusion criteria. Extracted data were synthesized into a systems-based conceptual model.";"Findings indicate that PACS is associated with dysregulation of the extended autonomic nervous system, characterized by persistent neurogenic inflammation, central and peripheral sensitization, and impaired function of the inflammatory reflex. These alterations reflect a maladaptive stress response triggered by sustained irritation of the nervous system.
Neuraltherapeutic Medicine, which employs local anesthetics to modulate dysfunctional neural circuits, emerges as a physiologically grounded intervention. This approach directly targets the neuroimmune circuit—modulating neurogenic inflammation that disrupts tissue function. By restoring balance in the inflammatory reflex and attenuating aberrant neural signaling, neural therapy contributes to the reestablishment of tissue homeostasis and resolution of persistent inflammatory states.


Observational studies and small trials have shown symptom improvement in PACS and similar autonomic-inflammatory disorders following neural therapy interventions, including segmental injections and ganglionic blocks. The physiological rationale aligns with historical nervism and modern systems medicine principles.";Neuraltherapeutic Medicine offers a promising, low-risk intervention for modulating core neurophysiological dysfunctions observed in PACS. By targeting the irritability of the extended autonomic network—a shared final pathway in post-viral and functional syndromes—it may provide benefits beyond symptomatic relief. This systems-based perspective bridges conventional infectious disease approaches with integrative neurobiology. While preliminary data are encouraging, further controlled trials are required to establish efficacy, optimize protocols, and support clinical integration. Neuraltherapeutic effect represents an important frontier in the evolving understanding and management of long COVID and related complex syndromes.;"neurogenic inflammation; local anesthesia; neural therapy; Neuromodulation; post-acute COVID-19 syndrome"

When persistent, this stress may impair academic performance, mental health, and future professional practice. Mindfulness, defined as the self-regulation of attention with non-judgmental awareness of the present moment, has demonstrated recognized therapeutic potential. Evidence suggests that strategies such as Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR), when practiced regularly, can reduce stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms while promoting emotional regulation and empathy. This study evaluated the effects of an adapted MBSR protocol, specifically designed for medical students, on perceived stress and inflammatory marker modulation.;" A prospective, longitudinal, controlled study was conducted with 26 medical students from Faculdade de Medicina do ABC (13 in the intervention group; 13 in the control group). The intervention involved six weekly 1.5-hour sessions of mindfulness-based practices. Assessments were conducted before and after the intervention. Subjective outcomes included the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10), the Cognitive and Affective Mindfulness Scale–Revised (CAMS-R), and the Philadelphia Mindfulness Scale (PHLMS). Biological outcomes included serum levels of cortisol, TNF-?, IL-6, C-reactive protein (CRP), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). Participants who missed more than one session, failed to provide lab samples, or did not complete the questionnaires were excluded.
";" Twelve participants completed the study (six per group), resulting in a dropout rate of 53.9%. Attrition was likely related to emotional discomfort during mindfulness practices and overlap with final exams, which may also have influenced outcomes. Still, significant and literature-aligned differences were observed.
 In the intervention group, perceived stress decreased by 53.35%, while it increased by 6.29% in controls. CAMS-R scores showed a progressive increase in mindfulness traits (+45.16% intervention vs. +21.18% control). On the PHLMS, notable increases were observed in acceptance (+21.12% intervention vs. +2.55% control) and awareness (+20% intervention vs. ?16.82% control), suggesting enhanced emotional stability and mental presence among mindfulness practitioners, even under academic pressure.
 Regarding biological outcomes, CRP levels dropped markedly in the intervention group (?53.37%) but rose in controls (+20%), indicating favorable inflammatory modulation. ESR rose slightly in the intervention group (+3.95%) but sharply in controls (+65.09%). IL-6 increased in both groups, though less in the intervention group (+31.88% vs. +117.32%). Interestingly, TNF-? rose sharply in the intervention group (+527.36%), possibly reflecting acute inflammatory responses to emotional release during practices. Cortisol levels decreased similarly in both groups (~6.5%).
"; Despite the small sample size and high dropout rate, regular engagement in the protocol's activities proved to be an effective and accessible strategy for reducing perceived stress, enhancing mindfulness, and modulating inflammatory markers in medical students. Although more robust studies are needed, the findings support the inclusion of mindfulness as a complementary tool in mental health promotion. Moreover, the adapted protocol shows potential for standardization and integration into university extension programs. Its implementation may contribute to the development of emotionally intelligent, resilient, and compassionate physicians, with a positive impact on patient care and professional sustainability.;"Mindfulness; Stress; Medical Students; Biological Markers; "

These factors exert their influence through complex neuroendocrine and immuno-inflammatory pathways. While these connections are gaining traction, the precise biological mechanisms often remain under-explored in conventional healthcare. Traditional, Complementary, and Integrative Medicine (TCIM) approaches, particularly mind-body practices, offer a promising avenue to modulate these pathways, providing a biologically plausible and complementary strategy to conventional treatments. This mixed-method systematic review synthesized evidence linking psychosocial distress to disease biology, aiming to inform TCIM-based integrative strategies for broader public health application.;Following Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) guidelines, a systematic search was conducted across six international databases (PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus, PsycInfo, and EBSCOhost) covering the period from 1990 to 2024. Studies involving adult patients that correlated psychosocial variables with neuroendocrine or immunological biomarkers were included. Data synthesis followed the convergent segregated approach. A total of 231 studies were identified, and 11 met methodological quality criteria (moderate or high) and were included in the final synthesis.;The findings reveal that depression is associated with dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and sympathetic nervous system (SNS), evidenced by elevated levels of stress hormones like cortisol and norepinephrine. Chronic stress and social isolation were linked to increased expression of pro-disease genes such as NF-?B, CREB, YAP1, and the CTRA (Conserved Transcriptional Response to Adversity). These genes are implicated in key pathological processes including inflammation, immune suppression, and cellular dysfunction across various conditions. Immune analyses demonstrated reduced Natural Killer (NK) cell activity and elevated T-regulatory (Treg) cells, alongside sustained pro-inflammatory cytokine activity (e.g., IL-6, TNF-?). These mechanisms collectively foster a disease-permissive microenvironment, impacting processes like epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) pathway activation, which are relevant not only in cancer but also in cardiovascular disease and mental health disorders. The results of this review indicate that stress management interventions, such as Cognitive Behavioral Stress Management (CBSM) and Relaxation Training, should be considered as adjuvants in oncological treatment, especially in patients undergoing chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or surgery. These interventions demonstrated a reduction in inflammatory markers such as IL-6, NF-?B, and pro-tumor gene expression profiles (CTRA), in addition to contributing to the positive modulation of the HPA axis and the sympathetic nervous system (SNS). Future clinical trials should investigate the efficacy of these interventions using molecular biomarkers to assess their biobehavioral impact and therapeutic benefit in a diverse range of public health contexts.;The sustained activation of the HPA axis and SNS by psychological distress facilitates critical disease processes, including immune evasion and metastasis in cancer, and contributes to the progression of other chronic conditions. These findings provide a compelling biological rationale for integrating mind-body TCIM modalities—such as mindfulness, yoga, meditation, acupuncture, and psychosocial support—into standard healthcare across the spectrum from health promotion to the management of challenging clinical outcomes. ;"Psychosomatic Medicine; Psychophysiology; Angiogenesis Modulating Agents; Metastasis; Tumor Escape"

This review aims to aggregate previous meditation research conducted with pregnant women and to specifically identify the difficulties and limitations encountered. The guiding question of this study was as follows: What are the difficulties and limitations of meditation research with pregnant women? ";A structured integrative literature review was performed. A total of three electronic databases PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, and Embase and the Google Scholar indexing tool were searched without language restrictions, and studies were evaluated according to inclusion and exclusion criteria.

The relevance of the titles and abstracts of articles obtained from the electronic searches, as well as the application of the selection criteria, were evaluated independently by two researchers for each potentially relevant title.;The literature search initially identified 2571 documents. After the eligibility criteria were applied, 37 articles were included in the qualitative synthesis. The main limitations in the study of meditation in pregnant women are related to questions regarding the choice of methods and how such methods can consider and encompass specific characteristics of the gestational period in addition to difficulties in recruitment and adherence to interventions. ;The main limitations with respect to meditation research in pregnant women are related to the choice of research methods and procedures and how they can encompass the specific characteristics of the gestational period, such as analysing the results by gestational trimester, making the inclusion criterion and interventions last throughout the pregnancy, and focusing the outcome measures, when possible, related to the gestational period. Clinical research on meditation in pregnant women using pragmatic methods can be a resource for understanding real-world practice.

Meta-analysis showed that compared to OHAs monotherapy, LWDHP-OHAs combination therapy significantly reduced glycemic and lipid parameters: FBG (MD=-1.40, 95%CI [-1.60, -1.21], 89 RCTs, very low-certainty evidence), PBG (MD=-1.65, 95%CI [-1.88, -1.41], 81 RCTs, very low- certainty evidence), HbA1c (MD=-0.94, 95%CI [-1.14, -0.73], 38 RCTs, very low- certainty evidence), HOMA-IR (MD=-1.04, 95%CI [-1.26, -0.82], 13 RCTs, very low- certainty evidence), TG (MD=-0.34, 95%CI [-0.40, -0.27], 27 RCTs, very low- certainty evidence), TC (MD=-0.56, 95%CI [-0.70, -0.42], 27 RCTs, very low- certainty evidence), and LDL (MD=-0.42, 95%CI [-0.57, -0.27], 22 RCTs, very low- certainty evidence). The combination also increased HDL (MD = 0.22 mmol/L, 95% CI [0.16, 0.27]; 21 RCTs). The certainty of evidence for all outcomes was assessed as very low. Five RCTs reported no significant difference in decreased appetite (RR = 0.45, 95% CI [0.16, 1.24]) or dyspepsia (RR = 1.08, 95% CI [0.26, 4.47]) between groups.";Meta-analysis suggests LWDHP-OHAs combination therapy may offer short-term benefits over OHAs alone for improving glycemic level, insulin resistance, and lipid profiles in type 2 diabetes. However, the evidence certainty is very low due to methodological limitations and heterogeneity in included studies. Limited reporting found no evidence of significantly increased short-term gastrointestinal adverse events. Rigorous, multicenter, long-term RCTs with standardized protocols, adequate blinding, comprehensive adverse event monitoring, and biomarker validation are imperative to confirm potential benefits and establish clinical applicability. Future research should explore pharmacodynamic interactions and patient stratification based on TCM syndrome differentiation.;"Liuwei Dihuang Pill; Oral hypoglycemic agents; Type 2 diabetes; Systematic Review; Combination therapy"

Beyond official definitions, we were interested in identifying which terms for TCIM are best known in Germany and which term should perceptively be the most useful in public and political dialogues on TCIM in Germany.;This study is based on a cross-sectional survey of an online-representative sample of the German-speaking residential population aged 18–75 years, using a comprehensive questionnaire on TCIM use and attitudes. Descriptive analyses were carried out and decision trees calculated, using Exhausted Chi-squared Automatic Interaction Detection (CHAID) to identify key predictor variables associated with high perceived efficacy of TCIM.;"4,065 participants responded to the questionnaire. The term “Naturheilkunde” (NHK; literal translation from German: “knowledge of natural healing”) was known by 55.3%; alternative medicine 43.8%; complementary medicine 19.2%; integrative medicine 15.6%. The highest percentage of positive attitude was found for conventional medicine (63.1%), followed by NHK (52.0%), integrative medicine (41.1%), complementary medicine (35.0%) and alternative medicine (25.1%). The CHAID algorithm identified variables that predict with statistical significance (p<0.001) who experiences a positive effect of TCIM. The key variables were: a positive attitude towards NHK; considering personal positive TCIM-experiences to be important; and a positive attitude towards integrative medicine. Attitude to complementary medicine or alternative medicine were not relevant as variables in this model.";The German term “Naturheilkunde” which originates from the late 19th century popular movement on natural healing in Germany seems to be the most promising term for future public discourse on TCIM in Germany, due to its familiarity, positive connotations, and strong associations with self-perceived TCIM-benefits. While the term integrative medicine remains relatively unfamiliar in the German public, it also holds potential due to its association with self-perceived benefit, including among those with a less favorable view of “Naturheilkunde”. We suggest a Delphi process to define TCIM-terminology for the specific German context.;"Terminology; Semantics; Naturheilkunde; Cross-sectional survey; TCIM"

There is currently a lack of targeted treatment measures, with only symptomatic treatment available. Andrographolide sulfonate, a compound found in the traditional Chinese medicine Andrographis paniculata, has been developed into an injectable formulation known as Xiyanping Injection (XYP), which is widely used in pediatric diseases, especially in infectious diseases. Given its extensive application and the urgent need for effective interventions, XYP may offer a potential treatment for viral diarrhea. This review aims to pool the available evidence on the effectiveness of XYP in treating viral diarrhea in children under five years old.;"The present systematic review was carried out in line with guidelines of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA).Relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that conventional therapy plus XYP for treating viral diarrhea in children under 5 years old was retrieved from PubMed, EMbase, The Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang, VIP, Sniomed, and the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry System. The search period was from the inception of the databases to May 1, 2025. The methodological quality of the included studies was assessed using the Risk of Bias Assessment Tool. Meta-analysis was performed using R 2.4.4 software for studies with low heterogeneity?I²?75%?, and the evidence was graded according to the ""Recommendations for Grading Clinical Evidence Based on Evidence Matrix in Traditional Chinese Medicine.""";A total of 24 RCTs involving 2869 patients were included. All included studies had a high risk of bias due to improper randomization methods and the lack of blinding. Meta-analysis results showed that conventional therapy plus XYP group had a higher cure rate [RR=1.70, 95%CI (1.29, 2.24), I²=53%] and effective rate [RR=1.23, 95%CI (1.09, 1.40), I²=31.9%] compared to conventional therapy alone. Compared to conventional therapy plus antiviral drugs, it also had a higher effective rate [RR=1.38, 95%CI (1.22, 1.56), I²=33.5%] and effective rate [RR=1.16, 95%CI (1.10, 1.21), I²=60.6%]. There was no difference in the incidence of adverse reactions between the two groups [RR=0.44, 95%CI (0.19, 1.03), I²=28.9%]. A few adverse reactions were all mild rashes. The conventional therapy plus XYP group had a shorter duration of diarrhea (9 studies with conventional therapy alone and 12 with conventional therapy plus antiviral drugs as controls) and hospital stay(2 studies with conventional therapy alone and 4 with conventional therapy plus antiviral drugs as controls), but due to high heterogeneity, meta-analysis was not performed. None of the studies reported on stool consistency and frequency. The combined traditional Chinese medicine clinical evidence level was rated as Level III (Moderate).;Andrographolide Sulfonates (XYP injection) appears to have certain advantages over conventional therapy alone or conventional therapy plus antiviral drugs in improving the cure rate and effective rate of viral diarrhea in children, and it can be used safely. However, the quality of the included studies is low, and more high-quality evidence is needed to draw a definitive conclusion.;"Viral Diarrhea; Systematic Review; Andrographolide Sulfonates; traditional Chinese medicine injection"

Although the Brazilian Unified Health System (SUS) offers specialized, high-quality treatments, these can still cause multidimensional distress, negatively influencing quality of life and pregnancy success rates. In this context, integrative therapies such as Reiki - recognized by the World Health Organization and incorporated into SUS - have gained attention for promoting better coping mechanisms, adaptation to stressful situations, and reduction of multidimensional symptoms. Studies suggest that Reiki can be effective in reducing anxiety and stress in various health contexts, but scientific evidence regarding its use in AR remains limited. This study aimed to investigate the effects of Reiki on anxiety, stress, and pregnancy success rates in infertile women undergoing AR through a randomized, controlled, and blinded clinical trial. PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of Reiki on stress and anxiety in infertile women during the AR cycle. SECONDARY OBJECTIVE: To assess the pregnancy rate in women undergoing Reiki during AR.;A randomized, controlled, blinded, and experimental clinical trial was conducted with the research question: “Does Reiki have any impact/effect on stress, anxiety, and pregnancy rates in infertile women undergoing AR?” A total of 40 women aged 29 to 42 participated, most of whom were self-employed, married, white, had completed higher education, had a family income above three minimum wages, were Catholic, and had a diagnosis of infertility treated at the Human Reproduction Center of a public hospital. Participants were randomly assigned to three groups: Reiki (G1), Placebo (G2), and Control (G3). Data collection and randomization occurred between 2021 and 2023 using the RedCap virtual data manager. Psychometric scales validated in Brazil were applied across all groups to assess stress (Fertility Problem Inventory - FPI), anxiety (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale - HAD-A), and a questionnaire including sociodemographic, clinical, and integrative/Reiki knowledge data. These were administered at the beginning (Time 1 - T1) and end of treatment (Time 2 - T2) for all groups. The Reiki intervention and placebo were applied in groups G1 and G2, respectively, at three stages of treatment: ovarian stimulation, embryo transfer, and mid-luteal phase. Data analysis was conducted using IBM® SPSS® Statistics version 25 and R i386 v.3.4.0, applying both analytical and descriptive statistics. All ethical standards were upheld.;"Reiki and placebo groups showed significant anxiety reduction; stress changes were not statistically significant but clinically relevant. Pregnancy rates were higher in the Reiki group, suggesting emotional and physiological benefits during assisted reproduction.";Reiki proved to be an effective therapy for reducing anxiety in women undergoing AR and likely contributed to pregnancy success rates. There was clinically significant evidence of Reiki’s positive impact on stress reduction in the AR context. Future studies with larger samples and improved methodological design should be encouraged, as Reiki has shown promise and positively impacted infertility treatment outcomes for women undergoing AR.;"Stress; Anxiety; Infertile women; Assisted Reproduction Techniques"

We are sitting ourselves to death. (“Get Up!” or Lose Hours of Your Life Every Day, Scientist Says, 2014). An Indian study on musculoskeletal pain showed a prevalence of 55.2% with male preponderance (60%). It commonly affected the young adult population (ranging from 31 to 40 years), and the common anatomical site involved was the low back (54.1%) (Kumar et al., 2019). With current socio-economic transformation, more workers are committed to desk jobs. Prolonged sitting & repetitive, continuous, unnatural movements result in undue tension on muscles, ligaments, and joints in the shoulder and neck.;The objective of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness of integrated yoga on musculoskeletal pain, flexibility, stress, & quality of life of desk job workers in a tertiary hospital. A sample of 66 desk job workers with ages between 18 and 55 years, working in a tertiary care hospital, including both male and female, was included in the study. Musculoskeletal pain, lower back and hamstring flexibility, perceived stress, and quality of life were measured using the Cornell Musculoskeletal Discomfort Questionnaire, the Wells & Dillon sit and stretch test, the perceived stress scale, and the WHOQOL-BREF, respectively, pre- and post-intervention.;"64 participants completed the study; the intervention group showed significant improvement (p<0.5) in subjective musculoskeletal pain, lower back and hamstring flexibility, and stress & QOL domains as compared to baseline after 6 weeks of intervention. The standard group showed no improvement in any of the measures. In post-assessment analysis, there was a significant difference between the groups. The present study reports that 6 weeks of integrated yoga has resulted in improvement of musculoskeletal pain, hip and lower back flexibility, stress reduction, and increased quality of life. Various research has proved this mind-body intervention as most effective among complementary and alternative modalities in treating musculoskeletal disorders, alleviating psychological problems, and uplifting the quality of life. The work profile of desk job workers is demanding on their physical and mental health. The scenario is worse for those who work in a tertiary care hospital with OPD footfall of around 10,000 per day. Darivemula et al found a high one-year prevalence of WRNP (work-related neck pain) among desk job workers in a tertiary care hospital (Darivemula et al., 2016). This population serve masses at large scale in central and peripheral areas like admission, discharge, billing, registration, labs, accounts, administration, etc. Since there has been reliance upon pharmacological measures with the consumption of NSAIDs, opioids, etc for relieving MSP (musculoskeletal pain), it rather puts the users at stake with their high side effects and abuse leading to further addition of problems. Moreover, it’s not a permanent solution.";The results of  present study clearly demonstrated a decrease in musculoskeletal pain, an increase in flexibility, managed stress, and an enhanced quality of life. Yoga, combining loosening practices, specific postures, pranayama, relaxation, and prayer, effectively helps desk job workers manage musculoskeletal pain and improve well-being.;"yoga; flexibility; Desk  job workers; Parasympethetic activation"

CM, rooted in chronobiology, operates through mechanistic assumptions grounded in Cartesian-Newtonian science. ?yurveda, by contrast, is founded on an organicist paradigm that understands physiology as embedded within ecological and cosmic rhythms.

The objective is to examine how these paradigms differ in their conceptions of biological rhythms, causality, and knowledge—arguing that epistemological pluralism is essential for developing a coherent and truly integrative medical methodology.";"This is a theoretical and comparative epistemological analysis grounded in the historical development of medical systems. The study draws on historical and conceptual literature on chronobiology and the emergence of Circadian Medicine (CM), contrasting it with foundational principles of ayurvedic thought—particularly the doctrines of 'resemblance' and 'particularity' (i.e., loka–puru?a–s?mya and sam?nya–vi?e?a).

Broader discussions in the philosophy of science were also incorporated, with special attention to how unexamined reductionist methodologies in CM often rely on experimental models that disregard subjective, ecological, and temporal dimensions crucial to health. In contrast, ?yurveda’s principles support a worldview in which physiological, environmental, and cosmic processes reflect one another—allowing biological rhythms to be understood within a paradigm inherently oriented toward complexity and relationality.";"The comparative analysis reveals that Circadian Medicine, while contributing significantly to biomedical understandings of biological rhythms—particularly in sleep and sports medicine—remains epistemologically constrained by a medical rationality that isolates variables and mechanizes physiological processes. Its methodologies often rely on extrapolations from animal models with limited applicability to human chronotypes, and tend to overlook both the environmental determinants of physiology and the subjective dimensions of psychological states.

?yurveda, by contrast, articulates health through an integrated cosmological and ecological rationality, wherein time, environment, and consciousness are inseparable from physiological processes. This epistemological clash—between a paradigm grounded in control through fragmentation and one rooted in coherence through interdependence—demonstrates that meaningful integration requires first acknowledging the incommensurability of their respective foundations. Without such recognition, efforts to build integrative models risk internal contradiction and epistemic incoherence.";"While Circadian Medicine advances temporal awareness in healthcare, its underlying mechanistic rationality constrains the integration of behavioral, environmental, and spiritual dimensions. ?yurveda, as an organicist system, offers a coherent alternative paradigm for addressing the complexity of biological rhythms through a wide spectrum of metabolic cycles—such as digestion, circadian patterns, menstrual flow, seasonal transitions, and stages of life (i.e., bhukta, ahor?tra, ?rtava, ?tu, vayas).

The epistemological abyss between mechanistic and organicist paradigms lies in their radically different conceptions of knowledge and causality. Mechanistic approaches, dominant in biomedicine, reduce phenomena into discrete parts to explain function through linear, cause-effect relationships. In contrast, organicist paradigms—such as those backgrounding ?yurveda—conceive systems as relational, dynamic, and context-sensitive. These are not just divergent methods, but incompatible worldviews: one seeks control through fragmentation; the other, coherence through interdependence.

Thus, Integrative Medicine can go beyond methodological pluralism. It requires epistemological pluralism—acknowledging multiple medical rationalities as essential for navigating complexity in health and healing. Bridging this gap is foundational for contextually meaningful and scientifically coherent integrative models.";"ayurveda; circadian medicine; epistemology; medical rationalities; Integrative Medicine"

This level of care can be understood as one of the organizational pillars of patient and family care. Integrative health practices (IHPs) are complementary care services that use techniques to improve care. This study is justified by the need to explore and expand discussions on the inclusion of public policies involving the relationship between IHPs and PHC, and how this implementation contributes to the full implementation of PHC attributes and access to other therapies involved in the population's care. This study aims to discuss the aspects involved in the inclusion of IHPs in Primary Health Care Units (PHUs) located in Program Area (PA) 3.2 of the city of Rio de Janeiro, RJ. ;This descriptive and exploratory study, with a qualitative approach, collected data and identified the phenomena that reflect this concept through descriptive research. The study was conducted in 19 Primary Health Care Units in AP 3.2. The participants were health service managers who manage these units. The interviews followed a semi-structured script. The responses were transcribed verbatim and analyzed using thematic analysis. The study was submitted to the Research Ethics Committee for review and received approval number 6,686,310.;The PICS offered in AP 3.2 and the factors that contribute to and hinder their provision were identified. Thus, based on the data collected, seven categories were constructed, addressing: 1 - characterization of the interviewees, 2 - PICS offered in the UAP of AP 3.2, 3 - factors that contribute to the implementation of PICS in the UAP of AP 3.2, 4 - Factors that hinder the implementation of PICS in the UAP of AP 3.2, 5 - Opportunities in the insertion of PICS in the UAP of AP 3.2, 6 - Threats in the insertion of PICS in the UAP of AP 3.2, 7 - Internal and external factors that influence the insertion of PICS in AP 3.2. The technical-technological product - PTT, was built through an action plan where concrete actions were proposed to stimulate the training and increase the supply of PICS in the UAP of AP 3.2. ;We conclude that, in accordance with the objectives proposed in this study, it was possible to identify the inclusion of 12 integrative and complementary practices in the primary health care units of AP 3.2, where auriculotherapy is predominant in 80% of the units analyzed. Based on the evidence demonstrating weaknesses and threats in the inclusion of these practices, an action plan was developed to contribute to the units and the work routine of professionals, aiming at the inclusion and expansion of the offer of these practices within the scope of Primary Health Care.;"Integrative and Complementary Practices; Primary Health Care; Health Policy"

Median sample size = 44 (IQR 28–68); follow-up < 12 weeks in 72 % of trials. Sixteen validated anxiety scales were used, dominated by SCARED and STAIC. Seventy-nine per cent of quantitative studies reported statistically significant anxiety reductions versus control/usual care, but effect sizes were typically small-to-moderate and risk-of-bias high due to limited blinding and short duration. Geographic gaps persist in sub-Saharan Africa and the Middle East, and age coverage is thin for 9–11-year-olds. Existing systematic reviews echo these methodological concerns.";Yoga, mindfulness and related mind-body practices show promise for reducing pediatric anxiety, yet heterogeneity and design limitations temper confidence. Future research should prioritize under-studied modalities, standardize outcome measures, recruit more diverse populations and extend follow-up to assess durability. These findings inform clinicians and policy-makers considering integration of mind-body programs into child and adolescent mental-health services worldwide.;"Mind-Body Practices; pediatric anxiety; yoga; Mindfulness; scoping review"

For each source, we extracted country, health-system characteristics, integration model, funding mechanism, workforce profile, target conditions and any clinical, economic or patient-experience outcomes. Because all material was in the public domain, ethical approval was unnecessary.";"Four recurrent patterns of service delivery emerged. In-house clinics run by medically trained staff appear in frontier community health centres in the United States, where family physicians certified in acupuncture treat chronic pain and insomnia. On-site complementary-therapy units staffed by licensed acupuncturists are common in Brazil’s Unified Health System, which often combines acupuncture with phytotherapy and tai-chi classes. A third approach relies on formal referral pathways to community acupuncturists reimbursed by public insurance, as in the United Kingdom’s “Beating Back Pain” programs. Finally, several South-East London pilots offer group or community acupuncture sessions in primary-care buildings after hours, allowing up to ten patients to receive low-cost treatment simultaneously. Across these models, funding mixes vary: about half rely on direct public reimbursement, one-third on blended capitation plus fee-for-service, and the remainder on short-term grants or nominal patient co-payments. Evaluations—although generally small and methodologically limited—consistently report moderate pain reduction, high patient satisfaction and, in two economic studies, modest cost savings relative to usual care. No eligible studies came from sub-Saharan Africa or the Middle East.

";Despite differing health-system contexts, nations tend to adopt one of four basic models when embedding acupuncture in public primary care, and early results suggest the approach is feasible, acceptable and clinically useful. Stronger cost-effectiveness analyses, standardized outcome measures and studies in underserved regions are needed to guide sustained, equitable scale-up.;"acupuncture; primary care; public health systems; service integration; narrative review"

However, these studies remain fragmented, lacking systematic synthesis. This bibliometric analysis maps global acupuncture case reports/series over 20 years to identify trends, knowledge gaps, and thematic evolution.;Publications were retrieved from databases including Web of Science (2000–2025). CiteSpace and Excel were used to analyze contributions by countries, institutions, authors, journals, citations, keywords and topics.;"Among 508 articles analyzed, publication output exhibited stable growth patterns, with China (252 papers, 49.6%) identified as the most prolific country, following by South Korea (62 papers,12.2%) and USA (54 papers,10.6%). Key institutions such as Beijing University of Chinese Medicine acted as an highest influential node, and influential authors is Hu Hantong, with ten articles, though inter-institutional partnerships were limited. High-impact journals included Acupuncture in Medicine, Medicine, and Explore-The Journal of Science and Healing. The first bibliometric study, by Millea, PJ, was published in 2005 titled Acupuncture treatment of compression neuropathy of the radial nerve: A single case report of ""Saturday Night Palsy"". In type of study distribution, Single case report constituted the majority of publications (372/508, 73.2%), followed by case series/reports (95/508, 18.7%) and combined case reports with literature reviews (33/508, 6.5%). Besides traditional acupuncture, dry needling (45 papers) and electroacupuncture (63 papers) fire needle (45 papers) were prominent. Keyword analysis revealed evolving research foci, including fire needle, dry needling, acupuncture analgesia.";Acupuncture case reports/series have expanded significantly, with current hotspots emphasizing acupuncture analgesia and gaps in fire needle and dry needling. This study underscores the need for standardized reporting, strengthened interdisciplinary collaboration, and prioritization of understudied conditions. By synthesizing fragmented evidence, this work bridges traditional practice and evidence-based medicine, guiding future research to enhance clinical translation in acupuncture case documentation.;"acupuncture; case reports; Case Series; Bibliometric; CiteSpace"

One of the challenges is to reduce morbidity and mortality due to the various diseases affecting the populations. This involves, among other things, the transformation of available local resources into improved traditional medicines (ITMs). The aim of this study was to assess the potential of pharmaceutical products and innovations that have been developed against common pathologies. ;A semi-structured survey of Cameroon's territory was carried out with 15 laboratories, research structures and universities, 12 associations representing some 240 Traditional Healers (TH), and the health authorities in charge of drug regulation. ;"The results showed that 90% of the resources used to manufacture phytodrugs came from plants. Nearly 800 medicinal plants (MP) were identified and indicated for the treatment of 49 pathologies. The diseases most in demand were malaria; typhoid fever; hemorrhoids; and skin, urinary and genital infections. Only 160 of these MP were subjected to chemical and/or biological studies. 840 phytodrugs, with15.71% and 84.29%, were produced by research institutes and THs, respectively. Marketing authorization (MA) was issued for 1.92% of phytodrugs, all belonging to category 2. Most of the phytodrugs (88.3%) which obtained marketing authorization were developed by research organizations. The majority of THs (84.6%) guarantee the safety of their products through long-term use based on traditional knowledge. ";Safety in the use of medicines in the traditional system is not yet guaranteed, which poses a problem for the integration of traditional medicine into the health care system in Cameroon. The challenge is to provide evidence of safety and efficacy, and to standardize products.;"Healthcare; Improved Traditional Medicines; Certification; Medicinal plants"

Integrative Health Coaching (IHC) is a person-centered, evidence-informed approach, structured to support behavior change, and aligned with the principles of Traditional, Complementary and Integrative Medicine (TCIM). Applying active listening, mindful presence and motivational interviewing, IHC supports sustainable lifestyle changes by motivating people for self-care and responsibility over their health — physical, mental, emotional, social and spiritual. This pilot study evaluated the impact of a remote IHC program implemented on a small Brazilian company during the pandemic, aiming to promote sustainable healthy habits among employees.;"A health and wellness coaching program was offered to employees of a Brazilian health tech startup as part of a broader wellbeing initiative. On a pre-screening all employees expressed interest in implementing habit changes for a healthier life, predominantly in stress management and physical activity. With an adhesion rate of 68%, 15 participants completed 8 individual, remote health coaching sessions (50min each) offered bi-weekly. Participants unable to complete the program or without necessary mental health specialized treatment (self-reported) were not included in the study. The health coaching process encompassed: construction of a personal health and well-being vision; guided self-assessment for seven health domains (nutrition, physical activity, sleep, resilience, relationships, environment, and spirituality); client-driven goal setting and action planning. Mental well-being was assessed pre- and post-intervention using validated instruments: WHO-5, SRQ-20, PHQ-9, and GAD-7. Participants reported on implemented lifestyle changes along the process (documented in coaching records). Group follow-up sessions were conducted two months after program completion, to discuss lessons learned and support sustainability of implemented health habits. Qualitative feedback was collected  through open-ended testimonials (not mandatory).";"All participants adopted at least one new health behavior; 60% implemented two or more. Satisfaction and confidence towards change improved across all seven health domains (self-reported). Mental distress (SRQ-20) dropped from 43% to 17%; risk of depression (WHO-5) dropped from 37.5% to 7.7%. PHQ-9 scores improved, with ""no depression"" rising from 20% to 69%, and decreases in mild (60% to 23%) and moderate symptoms (13% to 8%). GAD-7 scores showed reduced anxiety: ""no anxiety"" increased from 20% to 53.8%, with declines in mild (53% to 31%) and moderate levels (27% to 15%). There were no severe cases of depression or anxiety. Post intervention, participants reported higher confidence in sustaining changes, particularly in physical activity and stress management/resilience. Testimonials reflected greater self-awareness, empowerment, and perceived self-efficacy.";This pilot program evaluation supports the value of IHC as a TCIM-aligned strategy to promote lifestyle change, mental well-being, and self-efficacy in workplace settings. Even with remote delivery IHC was correlated with positive outcomes, both quantitative and qualitative, across psychological and behavioral domains. These findings reinforce the relevance of health coaching in workplace and its potential contribution to global health promotion, in agreement with the literature. Larger, controlled studies are recommended to further assess its effectiveness and scalability.;"health promotion; Health behavior; mental health; Self Care; Life style"

It is primarily based on the foundational teachings of the ancient Greek physician Hippocrates (Buqrat, 460–377 BC) and the Roman physician Galen (Jalinoos). Over time, this medical framework was significantly enriched by the contributions of renowned Arab and Persian scholars such as Rhazes (Al-Razi), Avicenna (Ibn Sina), Al-Zahrawi, and Ibn Nafis, who expanded its theoretical and practical dimensions into a holistic approach to healthcare. Urinalysis, also known as uroscopy, has served as a diagnostic method employed by Unani physicians since ancient times and continues to be utilized in modern medical practice. Urine (Bawl) is considered as the by product of hepatic and vascular digestion processes (Hadm Kabidi wa Uruqi) in Unani medicine. Classical Unani texts detail the evaluation of urine’s color, clarity, odor, consistency, and sediment to assess the state of the body’s four humors and organ function. Despite its historical relevance, these methods remain largely qualitative and subjective in contemporary practice. So it was aimed   to explore the diagnostic role of urine examination in Unani medicine and assess how artificial intelligence (AI) can enhance its precision and standardization.;This review synthesizes classical Unani literature and recent advancements in AI technologies, focusing on image analysis and machine learning applications in urinalysis.;Traditional Unani urinalysis offers rich diagnostic insight but remains subjective and qualitative. AI can objectively analyze urine characteristics, detect patterns, and align findings with Unani diagnostic categories.;By merging ancient wisdom with modern innovation, this integrative approach holds promise for developing accessible, cost-effective, and culturally rooted diagnostic tools. It not only supports the digital preservation of Unani knowledge but also opens new avenues for interdisciplinary research in predictive and personalized medicine.;"Bawl; Hadm Kabidi wa Uruqi; Artificial Intelligence; Machine Learning"

In Portugal, chronic musculoskeletal Pain affects approximately 36.7% of the population. Traditional, Complementary, and Integrative Medicine stands as a holistic strategy for the problem of Chronic Musculoskeletal Pain; it is used by up to 70% of the population in developed countries, with half of these cases being for Chronic Musculoskeletal Pain. Our study is the first to examine the impact of Traditional, Complementary, and Integrative Medicine on conventional health care services for managing Chronic Musculoskeletal Pain in Portugal.";This cross-sectional study utilised data from 674 participants in the EPIPorto cohort, a sample of adults residing in Porto, Portugal. Data collection from 2013-2015 included demographic, socioeconomic, and health-related information, as well as responses to validated questionnaires assessing pain management, psychological well-being, and health behaviours. The primary outcome was the utilisation of conventional health care services. Statistical analyses included chi-square tests and Mann-Whitney U tests to explore associations between Traditional, Complementary, and Integrative Medicine use and Health Care Utilisation.;"Among the participants, 11.6% reported using Traditional, Complementary, and Integrative Medicine for managing chronic musculoskeletal pain in the past year. Traditional, Complementary, and Integrative Medicine users were more likely to engage in health-promoting behaviours, such as regular physical activity and higher vegetable consumption, compared to non-users. There were no associations between Traditional, Complementary, and Integrative Medicine and overall conventional healthcare utilization (non-TCIM: 80,6%; TCIM: 87%; p-value: 0,214), self-initiated treatments (non-TCIM: 59,3%; TCIM: 63,6%; p-value: 0,592) and self-valuated outcomes, 1-much better/5-much worst,  [non-TCIM: median 3 (IQR: 2 - 5) TCIM: median 4 (IQR: 2 - 5) p-value: 0,122], nevertheless there were significant differences in the number of visits to conventional services [non-TCIM: median 4 (IQR: 2 - 16,75) TCIM: median 10 (IQR: 2,5 - 32) p-value: 0,029] and expenditure, in euros, between the two groups [non-TCIM: median 18 (IQR: 0 - 75) TCIM: median 77,5 (IQR: 6,5 - 365) p-value: 0,003].
In this case, Traditional, Complementary, and Integrative Medicine treatments, from the perspective of conventional medicine practitioners, could play a valuable role in supporting drop-out patients: 1. Providing additional therapeutic options for patients with complex, treatment-resistant conditions; 2. Enhancing treatment adherence among patients with alternative lifestyles, 3. and maintaining engagement with patients at risk of disengaging. 
";While Traditional, Complementary, and Integrative Medicine users tend to adopt healthier practices, their utilisation, initiative, frequency, and expenditures related to conventional healthcare services also increase when compared to non-users. Mental health scores, polypharmacy, sociodemographic factors, and health-related lifestyle appear to be significantly associated with Traditional, Complementary, and Integrative Medicine use. These findings suggest that Traditional, Complementary, and Integrative Medicine is used in complement rather than as a substitute for conventional care in Chronic Musculoskeletal Pain management and could play a valuable role in supporting drop-out patients.;"Chronic Pain; Traditional Complementary and Integrative Medicine; Health Care Utilization; cross-sectional study"

To this end, before and after FC, the Coping Method Scale (EMEP) and the WHOQOL-bref Quality of Life Instrument were applied to assess the patient's perception of the impacts that IBD has on their quality of life, as well as whether their perception of the processes of adaptation and coping with physical and emotional aspects showed any improvement after the FC experience. The objective of this research was to carry out an intervention with Family Constellation therapy, in order to see if there are improvements in the perception of the quality of life of IBD (Inflammatory Bowel Disease) patients after treatment.; This is a qualitative, exploratory study, approved by the Ethics Committee of the USCS (5.638.053), in which the family constellation was applied to five IBD patients who answered the questionnaires of the Mode of coping with problems (EMEP) and the WHOQOL-bref Quality of Life Instrument, days before and twenty days after the therapy.;The study presented, through the analysis of results, in addition to an increase in scores for quality of life, reports of perception of improvement in several aspects in the ways of coping with living with the disease and treatment. Expectations regarding Family Constellation were met, even without prior knowledge of the therapeutic technique. Participants were able to refocus on their history and their illness, adopting new habits and a new perspective on life. This corroborates the improved overall quality of life, as demonstrated by the results of the WHOQOL-bref, and the way they cope with the EMEP and the reports provided in the questionnaires.;IBD is the chronic occurrence of episodes of serious inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract, which results in reduced quality of life and emergence of the several difficulties related to psychological and social aspects. We observed that the possibility of applying the therapy as a complement to the IBD’s treatment can be a support that deserves further studies, with larger samples of participants.;"Quality of Life; pratices of health; family constellation therapy; inflammatory bowel diseases; chronic disease"

Unfortunately, the efficacy of standard chemotherapies, such as cisplatin and doxorubicin, is severely limited by acquired resistance and metastasis, particularly in tumors driven by KRAS (~28%) or EGFR (~15%) mutations. Consequently, there is an urgent need for innovative therapeutic strategies. Plant-derived compounds still represent a promising source for novel anticancer agents. Diosgenin, a steroidal sapogenin with established bioactivity, has demonstrated antitumor properties across various cancer types. Here, we investigated the potential of diosgenin to enhance the efficacy of cisplatin and doxorubicin in KRAS-mutant (A549) and EGFR-mutant (H1975) NSCLC cell lines.;A549 and H1975 cells were treated for 24 hours with diosgenin, cisplatin, and doxorubicin as single agents and in dual-drug combinations (diosgenin with cisplatin or doxorubicin). Cell viability was assessed via MTS assay, and the half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC??) were determined using non-linear regression analysis. The nature of the drug interactions (synergism, additivity, antagonism) was determined using the Synergy Finder 4.0 platform.;As a single agent, diosgenin induced dose-dependent cytotoxicity in both A549 and H1975 cell lines, with IC?? values in the micromolar range. Importantly, combinations of diosgenin with either cisplatin or doxorubicin exhibited significant synergistic and additive effects across both cell lines, indicating enhanced cell killing compared to single-agent treatments.;This study provides compelling in vitro evidence that diosgenin can potentiate the cytotoxic efficacy of conventional chemotherapies in NSCLC cells, regardless of their KRAS or EGFR mutational status. These findings support the further preclinical investigation of diosgenin as an adjuvant therapeutic to enhance conventional oncologic regimens.;"diosgenin; Cisplatin; doxorubicin; Synergy; non-small cell lung cancer"

Stress can be caused by various everyday situations and pathophysiological conditions in the general population, but also by specific situations, such as the postpartum period. Studies indicate that meditation can contribute to stress reduction, promoting greater maternal self-efficacy in infant care, reducing maternal psychological distress, and increasing milk production. The objective of this study was to develop an interactive website to manage meditation audio files, collect information on user access, and provide other support resources to support the clinical trial on meditation during breastfeeding, to be conducted with mothers of premature newborns who attend the Human Milk Bank.;"The interactive website, called meditAMAmente, whose domain is meditamamente.com, was developed in conjunction with the Experimental Software Engineering Agency of the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio Grande do Sul (PUCRS) from August to November 2024. To develop the meditation audios, the researcher underwent training at the PUCRS School of Meditation from 2023 to 2024. The methodology used was ""Slow Meditation,"" designed by Malone Rodrigues, which aims to focus attention based on stimuli identified by the sensory organs, avoiding distractions.";"MeditAMAmente has four interfaces: one containing an introduction to the dynamics of the ""Slow Meditation Program""; another providing access to 10-minute daily audio-guided meditations lasting six weeks, each with a specific theme; one containing the ""Logbook,"" where participants can describe their perceptions of the meditative practice; and the last containing questions for interaction about breastfeeding in the ""Fact or Fiction"" format. The use of technology in health promotion is recommended by the World Health Organization and has become increasingly common. Among the resources employed in published meditation protocols and research, especially in the postpartum period, the use of a commercial app, audio management via mobile messaging, and in-person delivery stand out. However, it is still difficult to find a commercial app that adequately meets the needs of audio-guided meditation research, especially regarding access control and listening time.

Among the wide variety of medicinal plants currently available on the herbal medicine market, Cannabis sativa has stood out in the last decade as one of the most promising plants in the health field the therapeutic properties of phytocannabinoids is an area that is still in the process of development; some evidence has already been substantially consolidated. However, many doubts hang over controversial scientific findings, sparking debate in the health sciences community, with many experts pondering the benefits and potential adverse effects of cannabis.  With regard to cardiovascular health and the use of cannabis (medicinal or not), most of the studies carried out show that this use is a risk factor for the development of cardiovascular diseases. In order to survey the state of the art in research involving the themes of ""medical cannabis"" and ""cardiovascular system"", a narrative literature review was carried out in the main health databases.



";The databases used for this narrative review were the main references in the health area, mainly PUBMED, the Virtual Health Library (BVS/BIREME) and the CAPES Catalogue of Theses and Dissertations. Search strategies were devised in accordance with the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH terms) and Health Sciences Descriptors (DeCS), PUBMED and VHL descriptor databases successively. The results were collected in Research Information Systems (RIS) format and then stored in Mendeley software for managing bibliographical references. ;"Of the 207 studies included in the literature review, the first publications took place in the 70’s and increased exponentially after the 2000’s. The studies predominantly investigated human populations (n=101) and in terms of method, systematic reviews (n=68) were found in greater numbers, followed by experiments (n=58) and clinical trials (n=17). 
Regarding the clinical outcomes, cardiovascular function was the most prominent (n=11), followed by vascular diseases (n=10) and multiple cardiovascular outcomes in a single study (n=10). Regarding the interventions used in the studies, recreational cannabis (n=42) was the most researched, followed by the intervention of using standardised cannabis cigarettes (n=12) and injecting cannabis extract (n=10). 
It can be seen that there are a large number of animal experiments aimed at finding answers about the therapeutic effects or physiological mechanisms of active ingredients, most of which have obtained potentially positive and positive results.";"The use of cannabis (medicinal or recreational) influences and affects the cardiovascular system, but there are not enough conclusive findings to establish a specific definition of the therapeutic applications of the different types of phytocannabinoids for cardiovascular outcomes. 

There’s any clarity about the findings on the harmful effects of cannabis use; most of the results found come from observational studies that used population analyses on cannabis users of unknown origin. 
It is necessary to carry out clinical studies on the use of medicinal and recreational cannabis using different profiles of patients who strictly do not use any other type of substance or medication, using a cannabis herbal ingredient from a legally recognised source, with adequate quality control from its planting to the processing of its raw materials and the making of its extracts.";"Medicinal cannabis; Cardiovascular System; narrative review; Phytocannabinoids; Clinical Trial"

Accredited at a national level with one of the highest educational standards worldwide (4,000+ hours) according to the World Naturopathic Federation classification, the cAH takes care of the education of approximately 70 naturopaths each year, specialized in Traditional European Medicine, Ayurvedic Medicine, Traditional Chinese Medicine or Homeopathy.
On its way to becoming a private university by 2035, the cAH transforms itself from a standard-setting school - preparing students to pass examinations - to a professionalizing center - training the next generation of TCIM professionals.
Drawing on methods and models from various fields of research (cognitive sciences, neurosciences, educational engineering, psychology, sociology, anthropology etc.), its “Education & Learning experience” department launched a new Professionalizing Module (PM)  in September 2023. With a new way of using teaching spaces, tools, practices and timescales, the PM’s content and format intend to foster the combination of theoretical and experiential learning, active student participation and empowerment, individual self-reflective guided work, peer-to-peer learning in small or large groups, work before/during/after the class etc.
Through a 14-step course spread over 2 academic years, the path follows a learning experience logic (rather than a thematic modular logic) which guides the students to work on different attitudes separately (like layers of onion) and then merge and embody them. The expected output is a personalized career plan and identity as future naturopaths. 
The PM comprises:
- Six 2-day seminars, each focusing on specific attitudes: therapist, experimenter, researcher, entrepreneur, networker, etc.
- Eight 1-day checkpoints, covering topics such as professional ethics, intra- and interpersonal communication, legal aspects and patient rights, network building, value proposition and branding development, business model, expert inspiration, etc.
- One portfolio to support the end-of-module assessment, including: a business plan, a clinical case study, a photolanguage activity, self-reflective reports, etc.
";Our educational program evaluation study used a qualitative methodology with 25 students during 2 years.;"We present preliminary results evaluating the following PM learning objectives :
- Development of intrapersonal skills and self-knowledge 
- Development of business skills and inter-professional networking skills 
- Development of interpersonal skills in ethics, communication, legal aspects, patient rights
- Development of a scientific and research-oriented mindset, an evidence-based practice and practice-based research
- Development of a personal vision of integrative healthcare with a clear positioning within the global healthcare ecosystem
";In the short term, the PM seems to be very useful for the naturopath’s development and for the patient's benefit. In the mid to long term, we expect that this type of innovative learning experience will contribute to creating the TCIM professionals of the future, who are prepared to act as change agents of the healthcare system, and are able to adapt their practice to the population's evolving needs.;"Curriculum; Program evaluation; qualitative analysis; Interpersonal Relations; Attitude"

It also aimed to compare the effectiveness of flower essence therapy between the control group and the group receiving the flower essence formula.;The research was developed using a descriptive quantitative approach, using experimental research through the clinical trial method. Fieldwork was conducted at the Integrated Assistance Research Program (PIPA) at the Anna Nery School of Nursing and the Faculty of Nursing at UERJ. Participants were women aged 40 to 65 who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Data collection consisted of semi-structured interviews, including floral therapy consultations and the application of the Psychological Well-Being Scale (EBEP) and Spiritual Well-Being Scale (EBE). Monitoring was conducted for four consecutive months, with a monthly consultation. The study was submitted to the Research Ethics Committee and received approval number 6.875.023.;"The statistical program used for sample size calculation was G*Power version 3.1.9.2.

Regarding the menopausal index, the Friedman test showed a significant difference between the Kuppermam-Blatt questionnaire score categories between the visits for the control group, intervention group, and overall. Therefore, in all three groups, there was an increase in the mild category from the first visit to the fourth visit. However, the percentage increase in the control group was 133.33%, while in the intervention group, this increase was 266.67%, and the overall percentage increase was 300.00%. Thus, we can conclude that the group that used the floral formula ""Living the Climacteric"" had a greater reduction in the signs and symptoms reported in the first consultation. Regarding the psychological well-being scale, there was statistical significance for the domain of positive relationships with others, in the control group, where in the first consultation the average score was 78.8 points (±4.9 points) and reduced in the fourth consultation to 77.5 points (±6.3 points) (p = 0.049).

It addresses well-being holistically, considering the physical body, mind, emotions, and spirit. This system has gained increasing attention as a complementary and alternative practice for various health conditions, including those related to the female reproductive system. In Ayurveda, it is highlighted by specific branches such as ""Prasuti Tantra"" (obstetrics) and ""Stri Roga"" (gynecology), which are dedicated to promoting women's health through proper nutrition, disease prevention, and specialized treatments. This article explores the Ayurvedic classification of the uterus, known as Garbhashaya, and its healthy functioning about the Sapta Dhatus (seven body tissues) and the Doshas (Vata, Pitta, Kapha). It also explores some Ayurvedic treatments and therapeutic approaches based on evidence from case studies and literature reviews.";We are conducting an integrative review of the Google Academic Database.

All the articles selected presente good results with these treatments. The term Garbhashaya is derived from the Sanskrit words ""Garbha"" (fetus) and ""Aashaya"" (space or dwelling), the anatomical region where fetal development occurs. It is recognized as the ""eighth Ashaya,"" a special cavity or location present specifically in the female body that serves as the site where the Garbha resides and develops. Any abnormality related to the uterus can compromise implantation capacity and, consequently, lead to infertility. Ayurvedic treatment can help restore health. Therapeutic interventions include Panchakarma, Oral Herbal Medications, Diet, and lifestyle modifications: 
- Panchakarma Therapies: (1) Abhyanga (Therapeutic Oil Massage); (2) Swedana (steam on the lower abdomen); (3) Basti Karma (Medicated Enema).
- Oral Herbs: (1) Ashwagandha Churna (reduces menstrual pain and mental health). (2) Shatavari Kalpa (reproductive system, hormones, and uterine tone). (3) Hingwashtaka Churna (digestion, reduces constipation; relieves cramping pain and muscle spasms). (4) Triphala Guggulu (eliminates ""Ama"" (toxins) and regulates metabolism). 
- Diet and Lifestyle Modifications: (1) Pathya Ahara (Vata-Pitta pacifying diet: Warm, light, easily digestible foods). (2) Hydration (herbal teas like Ajwain, Ginger, and Dashamoola Kwath).

This process, characterized as scientific colonization, marginalizes foundational elements of Chinese Medicine—its philosophy, cosmology and medical doctrine—compromising both its theoretical integrity and therapeutic efficacy.;"A critical analysis was conducted of the scientific literature on Chinese Medicine and of the guidelines that inform research designs. Two emblematic case studies were selected for in-depth examination. Theoretical framing draws on Boaventura de Sousa Santos, who developed the concept of colonization in science and proposed non-colonizing science; Michel Foucault, whose archaeology of knowledge highlights historicity and power relations in knowledge production; and Madel Luz, who created and advanced the concept of Medical Rationality within the health sciences. These authors underpin our critique of the consequences of imposing colonial research methods and the imperative for plural, non-colonizing epistemologies.";"The predominance of biomedical methods and the adoption of Western diagnostic categories (Bianbing) over traditional Chinese diagnostic patterns (Bianzheng) diminish the complexity and efficacy of traditional medical systems. The concept of Medical Rationality emerges as a central tool to safeguard the autonomy and sovereignty of complex medical systems, enabling research designs aligned with their original principles—such as the promotion of vitality and harmony. Non-colonizing research methods recognizes and values the epistemological specificities of Chinese Medicine, preventing theoretical fragmentation and loss of its conceptual chain.

Exemplary case studies demonstrate that disrupting the theoretical articulation of Medical Rationality—imposed by exogenous methods—can lead to reduced therapeutic efficacy, practice distortion, and invisibilization of core aims like life cultivation and longevity. These harms underscore the need for a new research paradigm grounded in epistemological plurality and respect for the integrity of traditional medical systems.";A proper understanding and application of Medical Rationality is essential for developing non-colonizing research in Chinese Medicine. This theoretical approach restores and protects the original potential of practices—often diminished by scientific colonization—by reclaiming the breadth and therapeutic efficacy of complex medical systems. It is crucial not only for epistemological plurality but also for preserving the integrity and therapeutic power of Chinese Medicine and other traditional medical systems.;"Medical Rationality; Chinese medicine; Non-colonizing Research; epistemology; Harms of Scientific Colonization"

The imposition of exogenous biomedical paradigms has caused fragmentation of theoretical frameworks and compromised therapeutic efficacy in Traditional Medical Systems (TMS). Responding to these challenges and in alignment with the WHO Traditional Medicine Strategy 2025–2034, we present the prototype of the NCRM (Non-Colonialist Research Method) Scale: an innovative, multi-phase, and technologically enhanced methodological model designed to guide and evaluate research that preserves the epistemological core of Chinese Medicine and other complex medical systems.

Objective
To introduce the foundational principles and initial prototype of the NCRM Scale and checklist, a tool for assessing and guiding non-colonialist research methodologies in Chinese Medicine, with potential applicability to other traditional and integrative medical systems.";"The NCRM Scale project originated from a philosophical and epistemological analysis of the research methodologies and study designs commonly applied in Chinese Medicine. This critical reflection identified the need for tools that safeguard the internal coherence and theoretical integrity of traditional medical systems. The prototype of the NCRM Scale is an instrument currently under development, designed to assist researchers in constructing non-colonialist research projects. It consists of:

    A Checklist to ensure research designs are aligned with the epistemology, diagnostic categories, and therapeutic aims unique to Chinese Medicine;
    A Colonization Degree Scale to assess how much a study preserves or compromises the core theoretical framework of the analyzed medical system;
    A Methodological Guide offering decision-making algorithms and digital resources (including AI-based tools) to support the design of projects consistent with the NCRM principles;
    The integration of statistical tools that enable the evaluation of health outcomes without undermining the foundational concepts of traditional systems.

The NCRM framework is informed by plural epistemologies—including Two-Eyed Seeing, the Medicine Wheel model, and Medical Rationality—and incorporates best practices from TCIM research models. Its multi-phase development includes systematic literature synthesis (PRISMA-ComplexInt), expert consensus-building (modified e-Delphi, Q-Sort, Best-Worst Scaling), and validation across four weighted domains: Epistemological Coherence, Methodological Appropriateness, Cultural Safety & Ethics, and Innovation & Rigor. Future phases envision advanced technological integration, such as digital twin simulations, gamified citizen science applications, and adaptive AI assistance.";The NCRM Scale offers clear, reproducible criteria for non-colonialist research in Chinese Medicine and complex medical systems. By prioritizing epistemological integrity and methodological pluralism, it helps restore original therapeutic objectives and full potential of a medical system. Digital tools and algorithms may support broad adoption in the future. Initial applications indicate that the NCRM framework fosters rigorous, respectful studies and serves as a valuable resource for researchers, ethics committees, and funding agencies.;The NCRM Scale inaugurates a new stage in research on Chinese Medicine and traditional medical systems, moving beyond colonizing legacies and advancing a plural, effective, and epistemologically respectful science. Its methodological rigor and technological innovation make it a key instrument for preserving the diversity and integrity of traditional medical systems.;"Non-Colonialist Research; NCRM Checklist; Chinese medicine; Methodological Model; Complex Medical Systems"

Evidence shows marginalised populations have consistently unmet health needs and poor health service engagement, additional to histories of negative health seeking experiences. Emergent models of interdisciplinary primary healthcare that take a comprehensive view of the health and social needs of marginalised people, hold promise for engaging these groups in consistent and coordinated healthcare that is integrative and inclusive.;We present Phase 1 of an original research project employing a three-phase mixed methods approach with a case study focus, to investigate multiple stakeholder perspectives on assessing the barriers and facilitators to the implementation of integrated models of care within community-based primary health services for a marginalised demographic (Ethics Approval: ETH21-6083).  Focus group fieldwork (Phase 1) was conducted separately with each of the patient, practitioner and service provider/management cohorts engaged with a case study health service that provisions integrative health and social services to people experiencing marginalisation and disadvantage. Emergent themes were explored through in-depth thematic analysis.;Focus group results provided rich data for the development of concepts, themes and subthemes that explored the research topic. Themes arising from the patient-consumer focus group were grouped under the concepts: Initiating access to healthcare, Engaging with integrative services and Reporting experiences of health seeking. Themes arising from the practitioner and service provider focus groups were presented together under the concepts: Visioning inclusive values, Implementing integrated health and social care and Measuring success, replicating a unique model. The breadth and depth of the results arising from this research are discussed within a conceptual framework that identifies four ‘spheres of influence’ pertaining to health seeking for populations with experience of health marginalisation: (1) Individual experience, (2) family and community context, (3) service design and provision and (4) systemic structures and policy. Key findings outline the complex circumstances that impact marginalised individuals and the way these circumstances influence individual health and experiences of health service engagement. The way community networks influence healthcare provision and health seeking is explored along with discussion of the inextricable links between social context, housing and health for marginalised populations. The importance of designing and delivering community specific health services that improve access to healthcare, promote safety and facilitate teamwork across health and social disciplines, inclusive of integrative models of healthcare is highlighted. The impacts of health policy on the delivery of integrated healthcare and the ways systemic structures perpetuate health marginalisation are highlighted. Responses to meeting complex health and social needs and addressing health inequity are offered through supporting interdisciplinary, comprehensive and inclusive approaches to primary healthcare.;This original research project has explored barriers and facilitators to the provision of integrated healthcare within primary healthcare settings for marginalised populations, from multiple stakeholder perspectives. The findings provide insight into the acceptability of expanding the scope of healthcare to meet health and social complexity amongst marginalised populations.;"health equity; Medicina Integrativa; Primary Health Care; acupuncture"

In recent years, there has been a growing demand for Integrative and Complementary Practices (PICs) in Western countries, reflecting a shift in how people seek healthcare. In Brazil, the National Policy on Integrative and Complementary Practices (PNPIC) was established by the Ministry of Health in 2006. This policy incorporates meditation—a practice rooted in Traditional Chinese Medicine—among other modalities, into the services offered by the Unified Health System (SUS). These interventions are known for being accessible, low-cost, and supported by scientific evidence regarding their effectiveness. Meditation, originally from Eastern traditions, began to draw scientific interest in the West during the 1970s. This study aims to analyze the contributions and impacts of meditation on SUS users with chronic pain, particularly those requiring more individualized and humanized care within a highly complex healthcare institution.;A qualitative research study was conducted using the action-research methodology. Semi-structured interviews were carried out prior to the intervention. The proposed intervention consisted of eight weeks of Mindfulness Meditation combined with Awareness Through Movement lessons based on the Feldenkrais Method®. A numerical pain scale was used both before and after the intervention to assess changes in pain perception. Following the eight-week program, a focus group was conducted to further evaluate the indicators explored during the initial interviews. Additionally, a control group was included in the study, with two semi-structured interviews conducted eight weeks apart.;"The results were as follows: a reduction in pain and insomnia, an increase in self-care, an improvement in social relationships, and a change in worldview through self-reflection. Benefits were observed in the group practice both through meditative exercises and Consciousness Through Movement, and these benefits were shared with family and friends as well as incorporated into daily life.
The initial group was composed of six women and four men; by the end, three men and four women remained. It was observed that the participants approved of these practices and noticed the benefits associated with meditation not only within the hospital context but also in their everyday lives.

Health professionals play a key role in promoting sustainable practices and guiding communities toward healthier lifestyles. While environmental attitudes can influence behavior, they are shaped by awareness, motivation, and opportunity. In Costa Rica, despite environmental leadership, the health sector lacks formal training in planetary health and climate change. This gap limits the sector’s ability to respond to emerging challenges. Assessing health professionals’ knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors is essential to promote climate-resilient healthcare and support national efforts in adaptation and mitigation. Objective: To identify attitudes and practices related to planetary health and climate change among healthcare professionals in Costa Rica.;"A descriptive, observational, cross-sectional study was conducted using an anonymous online survey aimed at healthcare professionals in Costa Rica between January and June 2024. The survey employed the T-CHANT tool, originally developed by Schent et al. and adapted to Latin American tropical settings. The Spanish version was psychometrically validated in Costa Rica, with a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.88.
The instrument included 13 sociodemographic questions and 22 Likert-scale items grouped into five dimensions: awareness, experience, concern and motivation, behaviors, and closure. Sampling was non-probabilistic (snowball type), beginning with a convenience sample. Inclusion criteria included voluntary participation, active practice of a health profession, and Costa Rican residency. Exclusion applied to non-residents. Several professional associations collaborated in disseminating the survey via email and social media, using the Qualtrics platform to ensure data integrity and prevent duplicate responses. Participating associations included nursing, therapy, veterinary medicine, social work, psychology, and health sciences.
To ensure national geographic coverage, initial “seed” participants were selected from six regions and invited colleagues from their areas. A total of 274 valid responses were collected. Data analysis was conducted using Jamovi and RStudio, with both descriptive and inferential statistical methods. The study was approved by the Scientific Ethics Committee of the National University. All participants gave informed consent.";The sample was mostly women with bachelor's degrees in professions such as nursing, medicine and dentistry, with a predominance from the central region of the country. Low awareness was identified regarding the responsibility of the health sector regarding climate change, although the general concern is high regarding changes in the planet, impact on generations, and effects on health. There is motivation in the participants to prepare for the impacts on health and to reduce the carbon footprint of health care, as well as in teaching clients. Regarding behaviors, the need to improve the choice of sustainable food and the use of non-fossil energy sources at home and at work was identified as areas for improvement in transportation, waste reduction and leadership.;Although most professionals exhibited positive environmental attitudes, these did not always translate into corresponding behaviors, highlighting the need to improve professional training to promote sustainability in both professional practice and personal life among individuals in the healthcare sector.;"Environmental Health; Climate Effects; Health Personnel; Environment; Public Health"

Projections indicate a rise in prevalence from 643 million cases in 2030 to 783 million by 2045. Given the significant global burden of DM, the discovery of novel therapeutic agents to manage this disorder remains a critical health priority. In this context, natural products represent a promising source of bioactive compounds for controlling diabetes, offering potential alternatives to conventional pharmacotherapy. On the other hand, Brazilian biodiversity, particularly the Cerrado biome, has significant potential for the discovery of new natural products from medicinal plants, which are an integral part of the relationship between health and Traditional, Complementary and Integrative Medicine (TCIM). The Cerrado biome, a designated biodiversity hotspot, is home to several plant species used by local communities for their medicinal properties, including those beneficial for diabetes. Therefore, new initiatives to promote sustainable development, linking health and the environment, are essential. Psidium laruotteanum Cambess. (Pl), from the Myrtaceae family, is native to the Cerrado and can be found in Conservation Units areas in the Federal District. This study investigated the ?-amylase and ?-glucosidase inhibition potential of ethanolic (EEPI) and aqueous (EAPI) extracts, hydrolate (HPI), and essential oil (EOPI) from the leaves of PI to evaluate their role in managing postprandial hyperglycemia.;Ethanolic extraction was carried out by maceration, aqueous extraction was by infusion and hydrolate and essential oil were obtained by steam desiltation.Then, the ethanol extract (EE), aqueous extract (EA), hydrolate (H) and essential oil (EO) of P. laruotteanum leaves were investigated for enzymatic inhibition of ?-amylase and ?-glucosidase, using a serial curve to determine the IC50 (1.95-500 ?g/mL) by colorimetric methods, described by Bernfeld and Shinde.;Ethanolic extract (EEPl) exhibited moderate ?-amylase inhibition (IC50 = 70.14 ?g/mL, acarbose, IC50 = 4.23 ?g/mL). Notably, EEPI and EAPI demonstrated potent ?-glucosidase inhibition (IC50 values of 5.07 ?g/mL and 6.94 ?g/mL, respectively), outperforming the positive control, deoxynojirimycin (IC50 = 28.83 ?g/mL). HPl and EOPl showed no activity. These findings suggest the inhibitory specificity of P. laruotteanum extracts for ?-glucosidase inhibition, supporting its potential as a source of compounds to control postprandial hyperglycemia.;These preliminary results underscore the dual imperative of biodiversity conservation and bioprospecting for sustainable drug discovery. Further bioguided isolation of bioactive constituents is warranted, aligned with global strategies to integrate TCIM evidence into public health solutions while promoting ecological conservation.;"biodiversity; ?-amylase; ?-glucosidase; Public Health"

In Brazil, Ayurveda is officially recognized as part of the National Policy on Integrative and Complementary Practices. Its pharmacological approach is based on complex herbal formulations, often combined with mineral or animal-derived substances. Despite its global expansion and formal recognition as a traditional and complementary medical system by the World Health Organization, regulatory barriers remain a major obstacle to the international integration of Ayurvedic herbal products. This study investigates how different countries regulate these products, with a focus on identifying strategic lessons to inform potential frameworks in Brazil.;A qualitative, multi-method approach was employed. First, a documentary analysis was conducted using official regulatory texts, legislation, and pharmacopeias from 13 countries selected for their relevance to the Ayurvedic herbal products market and data accessibility. A structured questionnaire was developed in partnership with the All India Institute of Ayurveda (AIIA) and sent to representatives of regulatory agencies and experts in 17 countries, with responses received from 5. As it involved only foreign professionals and no Brazilian participants, ethics approval and informed consent were not required, in accordance with Resolution CNS nº 510/2016. The data collected were analyzed using thematic coding with MAXQDA software. Additionally, SWOT matrices were developed for each country to synthesize the regulatory landscape and identify strategic patterns.;"Among the 13 countries analyzed—Germany, Australia, Bangladesh, Brazil, Bhutan, Canada, the United States, India, Japan, Nepal, the United Kingdom, Sri Lanka, and Switzerland—six have specific regulations for Ayurvedic herbal products: India, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bangladesh, Bhutan, and Australia. These countries recognize Ayurvedic formulations via dedicated regulatory pathways and official pharmacopeias. Others regulate such products as dietary supplements or natural health products. India features a comprehensive framework with specific categorization and quality standards. SWOT analyses indicate that robust regulatory systems share strengths in official compendia, specialized advisory bodies, and risk-based classification. Key weaknesses include lack of formal recognition (Japan), stringent traditional use requirements (Europe, Canada), and regulatory gaps (Brazil). Opportunities include expanding global demand and regulatory harmonization; threats involve import barriers and challenges reconciling traditional formulations with modern standards. Overall, countries with defined traditional use criteria, institutionalized standards, and adapted approval processes achieve better integration of Ayurvedic herbal products.";The study reveals a heterogeneous and fragmented international regulatory landscape for Ayurvedic herbal products. While some countries provide structured and inclusive regulatory models, others present legal and institutional voids that hinder product registration and commercialization. In Brazil, there is no defined regulatory framework for its products.  Based on the international experiences analyzed, we suggest that any future regulatory development in Brazil could thoughtfully and contextually consider recognizing traditional Ayurvedic references, accepting long-standing use as supporting evidence of efficacy, adopting pharmacopeial standards for quality assurance, and establishing a dedicated technical advisory committee.;"ayurveda; Herbal Products; traditional medicine; Regulatory Affairs; Public Health Policy"

Hospitalisation is a potentially distressing experience for children and their families, often accompanied
by emotional, psychological, and physical discomfort. Humanising care through complementary and
integrative health practices (CIHP), such as music-based interventions (MBIs), has demonstrated
beneficial effects in specific paediatric populations. However, evidence in general paediatric hospital
settings remains limited. This study aimed to assess the impact of an MBI on perceived stress and the
subjective experience of hospitalisation among paediatric patients and their caregivers.";"Methods
It was a quasi-experimental study, cross-sectional, with a mixed-methods approach, conducted in a
paediatric ward of a teaching hospital affiliated with the University of São Paulo. The study carried out in
two phases: (I) a quantitative evaluation of perceived stress using a visual analogue scale (VAS) before

and after the intervention; and (II) a qualitative analysis of caregivers’ perceptions through semi-
structured interviews. The intervention included 20–40 minutes of live music using string instruments

(kantele or lyre), complemented by age-appropriate singing and spoken word. Quantitative data were
analysed using the Wilcoxon test; qualitative data underwent content analysis and lexical analysis via
IRAMUTEQ software.";"Results
A total of 125 children (mean age: 30.6 months) and their caregivers participated in Phase I. A
significant reduction in perceived stress was observed in both children/adolescents and caregivers (p <
0.001), with a large effect size (1.0). All participants approved the intervention, and 74.4% reported
behavioural improvements in the children. Phase II included 30 interviews, which revealed
overwhelmingly positive perceptions of the intervention. Caregivers described the hospital environment
as stressful and isolating but reported that the MBI provided relaxation, comfort, and emotional relief for
both children and themselves.";"Conclusions
The findings highlight the potential of MBIs as an effective, safe and non-pharmacological strategy to
reduce stress and enhance the hospital experience for paediatric patients and their families.
Incorporating music-based practices into routine paediatric care may foster more welcoming,
humanised environments that address the emotional needs of children and caregivers.";"Keywords: Music-based interventions; Complementary and Integrative Health Practices; Humanised Care; Paediatric Hospital Care"

In medicine, ozone is administered as a mixture of pure medical oxygen and ozone, a practice known as Ozone Therapy when applied within a defined therapeutic safety window. Medicinal ozone interacts with cell membrane phospholipids, triggering systemic effects primarily through activation of the Nrf2 pathway. This promotes physiological rebalancing, particularly in oxidative stress, inflammation, and hypoxia modulation. Ozone therapy is used in over 50 countries and was officially recognized in Brazil as a complementary integrative practice in 2018. The current evidence gap map aims to highlight the role of Integrative Medicine, particularly Ozone Therapy, across various clinical conditions. First published by BIREME in October 2019 and updated in 2022, this was Brazil’s inaugural evidence map and has become a key reference. It can be accessed at: https://pesquisa.bvsalud.org/portal/resource/pt/lis-47377. Developed by BIREME/PAHO/WHO with SOBOM/WFOT, the map offers a comprehensive overview of evidence and existing gaps.;The map is based on a comprehensive literature review (2006–2022), encompassing 26 studies: 18 systematic reviews, 1 systematic review with meta-analysis, 3 systematic reviews of RCTs, 3 meta-analyses, and 1 scoping review. It followed BIREME’s methodology, based on the 3iE framework. Searches were performed in EMBASE, PubMed, and the Virtual Health Library using MeSH and DeCS terms for ozone therapy. The AMSTAR tool assessed methodological quality: 10 reviews had high confidence, 3 moderate, 10 low, and 3 critically low.;The reviews were mapped across six intervention types (parenteral oxygen/ozone gas, parenteral ozonated water, systemic administration, ozonated water for topical use, topical gas, and ozonated oil) and 55 health outcomes (cancer, infection, inflammation, pain, wound healing, quality of life, and adverse effects), resulting in 334 intervention-outcome associations. Parenteral ozone gas was most frequently studied (192 associations, 57%). Among the total associations, 154 showed positive or potentially positive effects, 132 were inconclusive, and 8 showed no effect. Overall treatment effects included 14 positive, 5 potentially positive, 5 inconclusive, and 2 showing no effect. A bubble chart visualizes study volume, with bubble size reflecting the number of supporting studies (1, 2, or ?3). The analysis highlights ozone therapy’s broad potential in pain reduction (including lower back pain), improved physical function, healing, infection and inflammation reduction, and quality of life improvements.;"This evidence map outlines ozone therapy’s therapeutic potential in managing pain, inflammation, infections, and wound healing, with no reports of severe adverse effects. The therapy is presented as a safe, low-cost, integrative treatment option. The map strengthens the scientific credibility and clinical confidence in prescribing ozone therapy, while identifying areas requiring further research.

Despite advances in surgical, chemotherapeutic, and radiotherapeutic approaches, prognosis remains poor, and treatment-related side effects often compromise both therapeutic efficacy and patients’ quality of life. As a result, there is a growing interest in complementary strategies aimed at improving treatment outcomes and tolerability. Among these, phytocannabinoids have emerged as promising candidates due to their reported anticancer, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective properties. While the major cannabinoids THC and CBD have been extensively studied, the therapeutic potential of minor cannabinoids such as Cannabigerol (CBG), Cannabichromene (CBC), Cannabinol (CBN), and Cannabidivarin (CBDV) remains largely underexplored, especially in glioma. This study investigates the anticancer properties of minor cannabinoids in vitro and evaluates the potential benefit of combining them with melatonin (MLT), a neurohormone known for its oncostatic, antioxidant, and cytoprotective activities.;Human glioblastoma cell lines U87, T98, and U251 were treated with individual minor cannabinoids (CBG, CBC, CBN, and CBDV), both alone and in combination with melatonin. Cell viability was assessed via standard metabolic assays, while cell death was evaluated using cytotoxicity markers. Western blot analysis was employed to investigate molecular changes, including DNA damage response markers such as ?H2AX.;All tested minor cannabinoids induced a significant reduction in cell viability in glioma cells after 72 hours of treatment. Moreover, enhanced cell death was observed within 48 hours, correlating with increased levels of ?H2AX, indicating activation of DNA damage pathways. Importantly, the combination of cannabinoids with sub-optimal doses of melatonin further potentiated these cytotoxic effects across all three cell lines, suggesting a possible synergistic interaction. These findings support a dual mechanism of action involving both direct anticancer effects and melatonin-mediated enhancement of cellular sensitivity to cannabinoid-induced stress. The observed efficacy across multiple glioblastoma lines underscores the potential robustness of this combinatorial strategy.;"Our in vitro data demonstrate that minor phytocannabinoids exert cytotoxic effects in glioblastoma cells and that their combination with melatonin may enhance therapeutic efficacy. These results provide a preclinical rationale for considering minor cannabinoids and melatonin as a complementary integrative approach for glioma treatment. Given their favorable tolerability profiles and multi-targeted actions, these compounds warrant further investigation in animal models and clinical settings to assess pharmacokinetics, therapeutic windows, and synergistic potential with conventional therapies. Ultimately, this integrative strategy may contribute to the development of more effective and less debilitating treatment options for glioma patients.

Combination effects in human glioblastoma cell lines.;Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most malignant and aggressive form of brain tumor, characterized by high recurrence rates despite standard chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Several studies have demonstrated the significant cytotoxic effects of phytocannabinoids (PCs)—primarily cannabidiol (CBD) and ?9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)—in GBM cell lines, animal models, and even supported by a clinical trial. However, limited evidence is available regarding the effects of PCs in combination with other integrative therapies. In this study, we provide new evidence of a synergistic effect of THC, CBD, and cannabigerol (CBG) when combined with melatonin (MLT). The tested compounds, both individually and in combination, exhibited cytotoxic activity against human GBM cell lines.;Human GBM cell lines (U251, T98, and U87) were treated with THC, CBD or CBG and MLT. Cytotoxicity was assessed using the MTT assay. Autophagy and cell death were evaluated by Western blotting, confocal microscopy, and flow cytometry analysis.;Treatment with THC, CBD, CBG and MLT significantly reduced cell viability of GBM cell lines by inducing autophagic cell death. Moreover, the findings of this study suggest that the combination of phytocannabinoids with MLT exerts a synergistic cytotoxic effect on human GBM cell lines. These data support the hypothesis that integrative therapeutic approaches may overcome some limitations of current standard therapies for GBM, which are often associated with high rates of resistance and recurrence. ;"Although promising, these in vitro results warrant further validation in in vivo GBM models, to assess the pharmacokinetics, bioavailability, and potential interactions of these compounds. Additionally, mechanistic studies are needed to elucidate the precise molecular pathways involved in the observed effects.

Included in the National Policy for Integrative and Complementary Practices of the Unified Health System (PNPIC-SUS) in 2017, ICT stands out as the only genuinely Brazilian Integrative Community Health Practice (PICS). The aim is to analyze the structuring concepts of ICT training within the framework of Raul Gagliardi's Theory of Structuring Concepts, articulated with the theoretical perspectives of Paulo Freire and Pierre Bourdieu. We use the theory of structuring concepts because the abstract is an excerpt from a thesis under development, which focuses on investigating the training path of community therapists and the pedagogical resources employed.;"The structuring concepts present in the training material, the book ""Community Therapy Step by Step,"" were mapped and Discursive Textual Analysis (DTA) was applied in two phases: (1) initial identification and categorization of concepts; (2) cross-referencing these concepts with the frameworks of Freire and Bourdieu.";Care emerges as a structuring concept, not only as a technique, but as a way of being with others, supported by horizontal relationships and qualified listening. This care is realized as it intertwines with empathy, which is fundamental to recognizing the uniqueness of each individual and embracing their experiences. At the same time, by promoting spaces for collective listening, care enhances resilience processes, favoring the reconstruction of meaning in the face of life's adversities. Valuing popular, traditional, and local knowledge expands care beyond the biomedical, promoting the integration of knowledge and the recognition of multiple forms of care. This movement strengthens the autonomy of individuals by inviting them to actively participate in the production of their own care and contributes to individual and collective empowerment, reconfiguring the historically passive roles of users in the healthcare field. Thus, care is constituted as a relational, political, and transformative practice, capable of articulating subjective, social, and cultural dimensions toward a more humanized and inclusive model of care. The Freirean perspective emphasizes the role of dialogue and awareness in building autonomy, as it allows individuals to recognize their historical and social condition, developing the capacity to act in the world, which is fundamental in the formative processes focused on healthcare and the promotion of citizenship. Bourdieu's theory deepens the analysis of disputes in the healthcare field, which is structured by asymmetrical power relations, as biomedical knowledge imposes its legitimacy by subjugating other knowledge. In this sense, agents position themselves, resist, or adapt within these relationships, contributing to the reproduction or transformation of existing hierarchies;We conclude that these concepts not only facilitate ICT training, but also enrich the understanding of ICT training processes and offer support for new pedagogical proposals within the scope of the PNPIC and the SUS, aiming at more ethical, humane and transformative care.;"Integrative Community Therapy; Structuring concepts; health training"

In medical education, its teaching has been increasingly encouraged, with recommendations to integrate it transversally throughout the entire training, as is also the case in health policies on health promotion, humanization, and primary health care. Simultaneously, medical rationalities recognized as complex and complementary medicines—homeopathy and Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)—focus on individuals in their health-disease processes and on a holistic view of care. They act synergistically to promote autonomy and health, thus contributing to health literacy. These rationalities have been gradually incorporated into health services, especially in primary health care (PHC). However, they are part of the curriculum in only a few medical schools in Brazil, most often as elective courses. This study aims to assess the possibilities and limitations of teaching the medical specialties of homeopathy and acupuncture—recognized in Brazil by the Federal Medical Council since 1980 and 1995, respectively—in the context of Brazilian medical education, focusing on the development of competencies related to health literacy.;This is a narrative literature review, including articles, dissertations, theses, and official documents published from 2006—when the National Policy on Integrative and Complementary Practices was established, recognizing TCM and homeopathy as relevant practices in comprehensive health care—through 2024. This approach was chosen due to the breadth of material selection, considering the scarcity of publications addressing homeopathy, TCM/acupuncture, health literacy, and medical education together. The databases consulted were the Virtual Health Library, PubMed, and OasisBR, in Portuguese, English, and Spanish.;"The main findings regarding the roles of homeopathy and TCM/acupuncture in health literacy and medical education include: (1) valuing patients’ life stories and traditional knowledge; (2) enhancing patients’ understanding of the health-disease process, expanding clinical perspectives and strengthening patient protagonism; (3) promoting autonomy and self-care; (4) contributing to health education and promotion; (5) reducing pharmaceutical drug use; (6) supporting chronic disease prevention.
The results highlight the potential of integrative and complementary practices to improve medical education by fostering communication and empathy skills, encouraging respect for diverse health cultures and knowledge, and reinforcing more humanized and patient-centered care. Regarding health literacy, homeopathy and TCM/acupuncture contribute to engaging individuals and communities in self-care practices, promoting health, and preventing diseases.";The integration of homeopathy and TCM into medical education can strengthen understanding of self-care, improve the ability to critically interpret information, and encourage shared decision-making practices, all central elements of health literacy. This study does not intend to be exhaustive but may contribute to the debate on curriculum revision in medical schools, emphasizing the importance of more holistic and patient-centered training aligned with both national and international guidelines. Valuing health literacy as a core physician competency reinforces the social and ethical role of the profession, aligning medical practice more closely with the real needs of the population.;"Homeopathy; Traditional Chinese Medicine; health literacy; Medical education; Integrative Practices"

In this context, complementary approaches that promote well-being and encourage self-care become essential. Bach Flower Therapy, recognized as a Complementary and Integrative Practice within Brazil’s Unified Health System (SUS), has been used as a resource for emotional regulation. This study aimed to understand the subjective experience of informal caregivers using Bach Flower Therapy for emotional regulation in the context of home care.;"This qualitative study comprised the final phase of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial conducted in a municipality in São Paulo, Brazil, in partnership with the ""Melhor em Casa"" (Better at Home) Program. The trial aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of Bach Flower Therapy in reducing anxiety among informal caregivers of dependent older adults receiving home care. Participants in the qualitative phase were those who completed the intervention protocol and had moderate to high anxiety levels at baseline (STAI-State > 40), caring for older adults with moderate or severe functional dependence. The intervention group received a flower essence formula containing Impatiens, White Chestnut, Pine, Elm, Oak, and Olive, diluted in a 30% hydro-brandy solution. The control group received a placebo with identical visual and taste characteristics. Both groups took four oral drops of the solution (with or without flower essences), four times daily for four weeks. Semi-structured interviews were conducted in private at caregivers’ homes at the end of the intervention (March to June 2025), recorded, and fully transcribed. Data were analyzed using thematic content analysis, including coding and categorization of findings. Interpretation was guided by a phenomenological and relational approach to care, based on the frameworks of Maurice Merleau-Ponty and Leonardo Boff. The study followed ethical standards and was approved by the Research Ethics Committee (approval no. 7.253.542).";"Fifteen informal caregivers participated, including fourteen women and one man, with a mean age of 57.4 years (±12.6) and average caregiving duration of 27.3 months (±25.0). Four main categories emerged: (1) improvement in emotional well-being and sleep, with reports of calmness, mental clarity, and reduced anxiety; (2) strengthened self-care and self-esteem, with increased motivation and personal organization; (3) facilitation of elder care, with greater patience, tolerance, and fluidity in daily tasks; and (4) absence of adverse effects and a positive perception of the therapy due to its natural and supportive nature. Caregivers assigned a meaningful role to flower essences in their emotional coping and caregiving routines.";Bach Flower Therapy was well accepted and associated with positive perceptions of well-being and caregiving quality among informal caregivers. The phenomenological and relational framework revealed that the experience with flower essences extends beyond a punctual intervention, forming a practice of care and self-care expressed through the caregiver’s body, mind, and daily routine. These findings suggest that integrative therapies, when combined with attentive listening, can contribute to the humanization of home care by promoting emotional health and supporting sustainability in the caregiver role.;"Flower Therapy; caregivers; mental health; Complementary Therapies; Home Care Services"

Ryodoraku is a method of energetic assessment of the organism, used in acupuncture, which measures the excitability of the meridians (energy channels) by measuring the electrical resistance of the skin at specific acupuncture points.;"This was a quantitative and qualitative, experimental, uncontrolled study that compared pre- and post-intervention results. The sample consisted of 17 volunteers, aged 14 to 69, 14 female and 3 male. A structured interview was conducted, and energy levels were measured using the Ryodoraku method before and after the application of an aromatic blend of essential oils (at a concentration of 2.75%), known for their effects on mental and emotional balance, at three acupuncture points that form the ""line of calm."" The individual remained lying on the table for 20 minutes. After the break, we directed the patient to sit up and performed another Ryodoraku measurement and interview with the same questions as the initial interview to compare the results. With a favorable ethical opinion from the Human Research Ethics Committee under No. 70087123.6.0000.5370, individuals were randomly selected according to the following inclusion criteria: over 14 years of age, regardless of gender, marital status, profession, with or without children, conscious and oriented. After the objectives and methodology were explained, they agreed to participate and signed the Informed Consent Form (ICF). A mean separation test was performed at significance levels of 1 and 5%, comparing the values before and after the application of the treatment.";"At a 1% significance level, a difference was detected between the before and after assessments for the factors: Right P9 (Daling); Left P9; Right PC7 (Daling); Left PC7; Right C7 (Shenmen); Left C7; Right ID5 (Yanggu); Left ID5; Right TA4 (Yangchi); Right IG5 (Yangxi); Left IG5; Left F3 (Taichong); Right R4; Left R4 (Dazhong); Right VB40 (Qiuxu); Left VB40; Left E42 (Chongyang); and Well-being. 
For the factors Left TA4; Right BP3 (Taibai); Right F3; and Right E42 (Chongyang), there was a difference at a 5% significance level.
A greater sense of well-being was reported by the study subjects and confirmed with changes in the energy levels transmitted by Ryodoraku, due to the more distributed distribution of Qi in the channels. The results were statistically significant for the energy channels P (Lung), PC (Pericardium), C (Heart), ID (Small intestine), TA (Triple heater), IG (Large intestine), F (Liver), R (Kidney), VB (Gallbladder), E (Stomach). ";Despite the small sample size and absence of a control group, the present study brings significant preliminary findings on the association of both therapeutic techniques, Acupuncture and Aromatherapy, for health and well-being.;"aromatherapy; Essential oil; acupuncture; mental health; Ryodoraku"

Despite its widespread use, there is still a lack of evidence describing the physiological effects of this practice on the therapist. This study aimed to evaluate, through infrared thermography, possible thermal changes in the hands of the Reiki therapist during the application of the technique. ;The research was conducted with seven volunteer recipients who underwent individual Reiki sessions applied by a certified therapist. The experimental protocol consisted of three phases: acclimatization (15 minutes), Reiki application to the thoracic region (15 minutes), and post-intervention relaxation (10 minutes), totaling 40 minutes per session. The sessions were carried out in a thermally controlled environment, with ambient temperature maintained at 23°C and relative humidity between 50% and 60%, to ensure environmental stability for thermographic image acquisition. The palm temperature of the therapist’s hands was measured using a FLIR C2 thermal camera, with a resolution of 80x60 (4800 pixels), pixel size of 12 µm × 12 µm, and thermal sensitivity < 0.10 °C. Images were captured at three distinct time points: (1) 10 minutes after acclimatization, (2) every 30 seconds during the 15-minute Reiki session, and (3) during the 5 minutes following the end of the practice. The thermograms were analyzed using FLIR Tools+ software, and average temperatures were calculated for the central palmar regions (ROIs) of both right and left hands. ;The data revealed a gradual increase in the therapist’s hand temperature: the right hand rose from an initial 35.1°C to a maximum of 36.1°C at 900 seconds, while the left hand increased from 35.0°C to 35.9°C in the same period. After the relaxation phase, a progressive decrease in temperature was observed, returning to near-initial pre-session values. The results indicate a significant temperature variation in both hands during Reiki practice, possibly associated with peripheral vasodilation, increased local metabolism, and/or changes in the autonomic nervous system induced by the meditative state. The general symmetry between the hands, with a slight thermal predominance in the right hand, may reflect an individual pattern of energetic flow. ;It is concluded that thermography is a viable tool for the objective investigation of energy practices such as Reiki. Studies with larger sample sizes and inclusion of control groups are important to deepen the understanding of the mechanisms involved.;"Reiki; thermography; Integrative Therapies; skin temperature; laying on of hands"

Although still relatively unknown in Brazil, it offers resources to treat various pathologies. In TCM, herbology is part of the so-called “internal medicines,” which act on the Zang Fu (organs and visceras), providing inputs that help the body restructure internal imbalances of Qi. Despite its specific terminology and unique way to describing pathologies, TCM dialogues with allopathic medicine and has scientific evidence supporting its results.  
Since 2006, Chinese Herbal Medicine has been part of the recognized practices under Brazil’s National Policy on Integrative and Complementary Practices (PNPIC). In Brazil, it is regulated by PNPIC, and its products are registered by ANVISA (Brazilian Health Regulatory Agency) according to RDC 901/2024. ANVISA bases its regulations on the Pharmacopoeia of the People’s Republic of China, which latest edition was published in 2020. This pharmacopoeia includes information on Chinese herbal medicines, allopathic drugs, and relevant pharmacological data for the safe use of these medications.  
Despite its therapeutic potential, Chinese Herbal Medicine faces challenges such as limited access to the Chinese Pharmacopoeia, scarce researches on its application, and a lack of specialized training courses in Brazil. In this context, there emerges a need to implement a training and postgraduate course in Chinese Herbal Medicine, as well as establish a community clinic focused on prescribing Chinese Magistral Formulas and/or single Chinese Materia Medica, following TCM diagnostic and treatment standards.  
";"This summary aims to report the initial experience of a Chinese Herbal Medicine clinic at a TCM educational institution in Brasília- DF and present preliminary results from patient follow-ups. To evaluate treatment adherence and outcomes, a qualitative method was used through semi-structured interviews. These interviews begin during in-person consultations, which include filling out a medical history and conducting TCM diagnostic examinations—steps performed by regular students under the supervision of a qualified instructor. After the initial consultation, subsequent patient contacts occur weekly via phone, with in-person follow-ups during return visits.  
In July 2025, a new phase of the clinic  began: clinical data colletion for future research. For this purpose, patients are presented with a Informed Consent Form (TCLE),  following Brazil’s bioethics instructions, which authorizes (or not) the confidential use of their data.  
";The clinic started in March 2025 and has already treated approximately 17 patients, who continue to be monitored. A treatment adherence rate of 83% was recorded. Among the adherent patients, 100% reported some improvement in their initial complaints. New consultation dates are scheduled for the second half of 2025 to meet the demand of interested new patients.  ;Although the number of consultations is still modest, the institution’s goal is to gradually expand its services, maintaining a commitment to ethics and scientific rigor. Additionally, we seek to catalog data for scientific research purposes, intending to strengthen Chinese Herbal Medicine in Brazil and provide evidence of its efficacy.  ;"Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM); Chinese Herbology; qualitative research; Professional Training; "

A notable element in this process is the 2006 National Policy on Integrative and Complementary Health Practices (PNPIC), which encompasses 29 practices, including Biodance, incorporated in 2017 (BRASIL, 2008, 2017). Biodanza is defined by Toro (2002) as a system of human development and integration, promoting organic renewal, affective re-education, and the relearning of life's original functions, according to our basic instincts. Objective: This research sought to understand and analyze the conditions for implementing Biodanza in the context of PICS (National Health Program) in Brazil's Unified Health System (SUS), its potential, and its challenges. The main motivation was the scarcity of publications on the topic in public health, making it pioneering and relevant for the scientific community, management, and training institutions.
";"This is a qualitative, exploratory, and descriptive study, approved by the UFPE Research Ethics Committee under No. 4962189. Data collection took place between September and November 2021, covering all of Brazil. The study subjects were Biodanza facilitators who were working or had worked in a SUS service since the inclusion of Biodanza in the PNPIC (National Health Program). The sample was recruited using the ""snowball sampling"" technique (VINUTO, 2014). Twenty-five Biodanza facilitators were interviewed through semi-structured online interviews. The collected data were subjected to content analysis (BARDIN, 2016).";"The study reveals an incipient implementation, with weaknesses in institutionalization (BARBOSA et al., 2020). Biodanza facilitators are responsible for its insertion, organization, expansion, maintenance, and even financing within the SUS (Unified Health System), similar to other PICS (BARRO, 2020). Although a practice present in public health since the 1980s, it remains restricted to certain geographic areas (capitals and metropolitan regions). At the same time, it demonstrates contributions as a complementary therapeutic resource to biomedicine in resolving user problems or complaints. Primary Health Care was considered suitable for the implementation of Biodanza (MIRANDA, 2022) due to its characteristics; however, it is present at other levels of health care. The challenges identified were not barriers to implementation; progress in improving working conditions (connections, infrastructure, organization, protocols), territoriality, internalization, and universalization of Biodanza within the Unified Health System (SUS) deserves special mention. Biodanza training, like other PICS, fits into the privatized model of care, equidistant from the SUS context (NASCIMENTO, 2018). This suggests that training should include content related to the SUS, contributing to improved professional performance.";Given the scarcity of publications on the subject of this study, it fulfilled the ethical and political objective of including Biodanza in the scientific evidence for PICS within the SUS. It also paves the way for new research and timely dialogue between management, academia, healthcare professionals, and Biodanza schools about the positive impacts Biodanza has had on the Unified Health System (SUS).;"Biodanza; Integrative and Complementary Practices; Unified Health System (SUS); Implementation; "

An literature searching in 9 databases was conducted to 22th May 2025. Two authors extracted data and assessed the risk of bias independently. Statistical analysis was performed using RevMan 5.4.1 software (Cochrane Collaboration, London, UK). Meta-analysis with a random effect model was conducted when there was no serious statistical heterogeneity among trials (I² ? 75%). Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation was also conducted to assess the quality of evidence.;"Twenty-four trials with 3642 participants were included. All included trials were assessed as having high risk of bias. The majority of the included trials reported the benefit of effective rate of Cheezheng pain-relieving plasters was better than that of similar topical Chinese patent drugs(RR=1.23, 95%CI [1.03 - 1.47]?especially treatment of soft tissue injury (RR=1.29? 95%CI [1.06 - 1.56]) and degenerative osteoarthritis of knee joint (RR=2.67? 95%CI [1.95 - 3.64]); and reducing Tenderness score (MD=-0.16, 95%CI [-0.68--0.51]; Cheezheng pain-relieving plasters had significant advantages in relieving joint dysfunction (MD=-6.28, 95% CI [-7.64--4.92]); No statistically significant difference in adverse events was found between Cheezheng pain-relieving plasters and other similar topical drugs (MD=3.86, 95%CI [2.18-6.84]. And there was very low quality evidence that tenderness score, dysfunction score in the Cheezheng pain-relieving plasters groups were lower than that in the control groups. Although the heterogeneity between studies and the methodological quality of the study itself lead to the low evidence strength of the current conclusions, the results of this study are a valuable supplement to the founding of previous review.
This study systematically evaluated its efficacy and safety in the treatment of knee osteoarthritis, lumbar muscle strain, soft tissue injury and cervical spondylosis. The results showed that: compared with a variety of topical Chinese patent drugs or western drugs (such as non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), Cheezheng pain-relieving plasters had outstanding performance in improving the overall efficiency, reducing visual analogue scale (VAS), improving joint function and alleviating joint disorders, especially in knee osteoarthritis and soft tissue injury.";Cheezheng pain-relieving plasters, as an external traditional Chinese medicine preparation, has clear clinical value and good safety in the treatment of chronic painful diseases, and has the potential to be popularized and applied in clinical practice. Although the existing evidence preliminarily supports the clinical application value of Cheezheng pain-relieving plasters, there are still some problems such as small sample size, short follow-up time and lack of international multicenter data. Therefore, high-quality, large sample, long-term follow-up randomized controlled trials are still needed in the future to further verify its long-term efficacy and safety.;"Cheezheng pain relieving plasters; Systematic evaluation; Clinical controlled trial"

AMR threatens the efficacy of conventional antimicrobial therapies. Naturopathic modalities are known adjunctive therapies that could support standard medical care for this crisis. Yet the supporting evidence for naturopathic modalities to address AMR is dispersed with unknown gaps. Identifying these gaps will help fight AMR, inform policy, and direct traditional, complementary, and integrative medical (TCIM) research to produce rigorous research into AMR. To do this we report a comprehensive evidence map of human studies evaluating naturopathic interventions targeting AMR outcomes in infectious diseases. Evidence maps visually harmonize research across regions and modalities which can hasten the adoption of global best practices and the alignment of regulatory standards. They allow international researchers, health agencies and practitioners to more easily collaborate and identify common gaps and weaknesses in the TCIM research. ;This project utilizes the six-step methodology outlined by Schveitzer et al. and applies the Preferred Reporting Items for Mapping Reviews (PRITEM) guideline for evidence mapping. The process begins with topic scoping and stakeholder engagement (involving policy experts, practitioners, and patient representatives) to frame research questions. The protocol is registered on the Open Science Framework (OSF). A systematic literature search is conducted across multiple databases (PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Alt Health Watch, Google Scholar, and PROSPERO). Article screening is performed independently and in duplicate using Rayyan, and a PRISMA flow diagram is recorded. Study metadata, intervention details, outcomes, and equity indicators are extracted into customized REDCap instruments with members of the World Naturopathic Federation Antimicrobial Resistance Committee. Study quality is appraised independently using AMSTAR 2 and MMAT tools. Extracted data are synthesized and visualized in interactive Tableau dashboards in collaboration with CABSIN/BIREME and PAHO.;The evidence map will synthesize  the clinical effectiveness of naturopathic modalities - including herbal medicine, essential oils, clinical nutrition/nutraceuticals, probiotics, hydrotherapy, applied nutrition/diet, exercise/movement, and acupuncture—in optimizing health outcomes in infectious diseases and related immune function. Disease outcomes covered include urinary tract infections, respiratory infections, skin infections, gastroenteritis, dysbiosis-related symptoms, and antimicrobial-associated diarrhea. To date, we have identified 200 systematic reviews from PubMed, supplemented with additional primary studies as indicated by gaps in systematic review coverage. Preliminary mapping reveals evidence clusters for herbal medicine, clinical nutrition, and probiotics in respiratory and gastrointestinal infections, alongside notable research gaps in lifestyle therapies, hydrotherapy, and acupuncture for AMR-related outcomes.The completed evidence map will visually display all identified human clinical studies on naturopathic approaches to AMR.;This evidence map provides a transparent, replicable framework for mapping evidence on naturopathic interventions addressing AMR. By visually identifying evidence clusters and gaps, the project supports the integration of complementary and integrative interventions into AMR strategies, informs policymakers, and delineates research priorities for the international traditional complementary and integrative medicine community. The mapping process is designed to enhance global collaboration, improve research efficiency, and ultimately support evidence-informed decision-making in the context of planetary health.;"antimicrobial activity; Evidence Map; infectious diseases; Immune; Evidence-Informed Decision Making"

Evidence highlights associations between periodontal disease, endodontic infections, necrotic teeth, and exposure to toxic metals (e.g., mercury in amalgams) with chronic inflammatory burden. This underscores the need for an integrative perspective that bridges conventional dentistry with complementary approaches in Traditional Chinese and Integrative Medicine (TCIM).;"A systematic search was conducted in PubMed/MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, and SciELO up to August 2025. Search terms combined descriptors related to oral infections (“periodontitis”, “endodontic infection”, “necrotic teeth”, “mercury”) and systemic/neurological outcomes (“systemic inflammation”, “neurodegeneration”, “autoimmune disease”). Inclusion criteria: human studies reporting systemic biomarkers, neurological or systemic outcomes associated with oral conditions. Exclusion criteria: case reports, in vitro or animal studies. Two reviewers independently screened titles/abstracts and full texts; data were extracted using a standardized form.";From 612 records identified, 47 studies met the eligibility criteria. Most were observational cohorts or case-control studies, with six clinical trials. Consistent evidence showed that oral infections were associated with elevated inflammatory biomarkers (CRP, IL-6, TNF-?, fibrinogen). Several studies linked periodontitis and apical lesions to increased risk of cardiovascular disease, cognitive decline, and autoimmune disorders. Limited clinical evidence suggested that removal of infectious foci (e.g., extraction of necrotic teeth or surgical management of cavitations) was associated with symptom remission in selected patients. However, heterogeneity in methods and outcomes precludes definitive conclusions.;Current evidence indicates that chronic oral infections and exposure to toxic metals may contribute to systemic and neurological disorders through persistent inflammation. Integration of dental care with TCIM approaches—such as modulation of inflammatory pathways, support of immune balance, and patient-centered holistic assessment—may enhance clinical outcomes. Well-designed longitudinal studies are needed to clarify causal pathways and to support integrative strategies in patient management.;"Oral health; brain health; Systemic health"

Osteonecrotic cavitations of the jaw and maxilla—often asymptomatic—are lesions described since the 1920s. When present, they may manifest as Cavitational Osteonecrosis-Induced Neuralgia (CON); however, even without pain, they constitute Fatty Degenerative Osteonecrosis of the Jaw (FDOJ), often associated with the proinflammatory chemokine CCL5. These cavitations result from trauma, infections, alendronates, anesthetics, and tooth extractions, and they remain difficult to detect via conventional radiographs. Functional tests, such as muscle response testing and energetic field analysis, have proven useful in identifying areas of circulatory compromise and chronic inflammation. These lesions predominantly affect women aged 40 to 60, particularly in the region of the third molars, and are associated with reduced blood flow, impaired regeneration, and persistent low-grade infections. Conventional surgical curettage alone often fails to fully resolve these conditions. An integrative therapeutic approach incorporating ozone therapy, high-power Er:YAG laser, and autologous platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) enhances vascularization, regeneration, and healing. Microcirculation plays a key role in cellular nutrition and detoxification, and its compromise impacts systemic physiology. Clinical evidence suggests that these cavitations contribute to systemic inflammatory, cardiovascular, neurological, autoimmune, and even neoplastic diseases. Coagulation abnormalities and hypofibrinolysis are also common among affected individuals. Clinical observations in four female patients with confirmed cavitations provided the first visual evidence of peripheral blood improvement following treatment. Blood analysis revealed decreased rouleaux formation, reduced erythrocyte aggregation, and increased zeta potential—enhancing blood flow and tissue oxygenation. Additionally, post-treatment reductions in inflammatory cytokines such as interleukins, immunoglobulins, and fibrinogen correlated with improved rheology, reduced viscosity, and vasodilation. These findings reinforce the concept that jawbone cavitations are not merely local issues but systemic disruptors. Their proper identification and integrative treatment offer a powerful strategy for restoring biochemical and bioenergetic balance—supporting both oral and systemic health.";"
This case series utilized clinical observation to assess an integrative therapeutic protocol for jawbone cavitations and their systemic effects in four female patients. Diagnosed via clinical history, advanced imaging, and functional tests, patients received ozone therapy, Er:YAG laser, and PRF. Pre- and post-treatment, we observed improved peripheral blood flow, reduced rouleaux formation and erythrocyte aggregation, increased zeta potential, and decreased inflammatory cytokines. These findings suggest that jawbone cavitations are systemic disruptors and that an integrative approach beneficially impacts microcirculation and inflammatory markers, restoring biochemical and bioenergetic balance.
";Our clinical observations in four patients revealed improved microcirculation and reduced inflammatory cytokines post-integrative treatment of jawbone cavitations. This indicates cavitations are systemic disruptors, and their proper treatment is crucial for both oral and systemic balance.;Our clinical observations in four patients highlight that jawbone cavitations are significant systemic disruptors, not merely isolated oral issues. The integrative treatment of these cavitations, combining ozone, Er:YAG laser, and PRF, effectively improved microcirculation and reduced inflammatory cytokines. This demonstrates their crucial role in restoring both oral and broader systemic health. These findings underscore the vital need for a holistic dental-medical approach to patient care, emphasizing proper identification and integrative treatment as a powerful strategy for overall well-being.;"Osteonecrotic cavitation; Fatty degenerative osteonecrosis; Peripheral blood; Inflammation"

However, evidence on CRRPA is dispersed across multiple scientific disciplines including anthropology, Indigenous studies, behavioral medicine, gerontology, and public health. Furthermore, culturally specific terminology complicates identification of relevant literature through conventional search strategies, which are typically oriented toward Western biomedical frameworks. Aims are to develop and implement a comprehensive, tiered, expert- and AI-informed search strategy to synthesize evidence on CRRPA for global health promotion.;"A scoping review framework is being employed to guide evidence synthesis. The search strategy is being designed in collaboration with global and public health experts and library scientists with cultural and regional expertise. We are utilizing a tiered approach across two broad strategies: (i) generic terms relevant to CRRPA (e.g., physical activity, exercise) and (ii) specific activity-based search terms (e.g., hula, Tai Chi). Within the second strategy, multiple tiers are applied: Teir 1 incorporates broad terms related to different categories of activities including ethnic dance, martial arts, food acquisition, sports and games, and others. Tier 2 includes terms derived from preliminary review and study team expertise. Tier 3 draws from established resources (e.g. lists from UNESCO and Traditional Sports Organization). Tier 4 employs AI-generated search terms from SCOPUS AI and ChatGPT. Tier 5 integrates terms from reference librarians with regional and cultural expertise.

Multiple databases will be searched to capture multidisciplinary evidence, including PubMed, CINAHL, Web of Science, EBSCOhost, PsycInfo, AnthroSource, SocIndex, ATLA Religion Database, Sports Medicine & Education Index, and SportDISCUS. Search terms are adapted using both Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and keywords. Grey literature sources will also be explored to capture community-based and non-indexed publications. ";"Preliminary review has identified literature on a wide variety of CRRPAs across multiple disciplines. Practices such as yoga, Tai Chi, and Qigong have been well documented for their health benefits, particularly for mental wellbeing and chronic disease management. In contrast, other activities remain underrepresented or absent from indexed databases. Additionally, we expect that the research will be disproportionately skewed toward the Global North, with limited representation from Africa, Latin America, and parts of Asia.

The iterative refinement of search terms, guided by expert input and AI tools, is expected to enhance identification of culturally specific terminology not captured by standard indexing systems.
";The development of this tiered, interdisciplinary search strategy offers a novel, inclusive approach to synthesizing evidence on CRRPA. By integrating cultural expertise, AI-assisted search term generation, and a structured methodology, this approach addresses linguistic challenges and disciplinary fragmentation in the literature. Anticipated outcomes include identifying both well-studied and overlooked CRRPAs, highlighting gaps in the research, including underrepresented populations (e.g., refugees) and geographical disparities. This strategy also recognizes the importance of decolonial and postcolonial perspectives in categorizing and analyzing CRRPA across regions. Ultimately, this work aims to inform equitable, culturally relevant health promotion strategies worldwide. Furthermore, this approach may serve as a model for evidence synthesis in other complex public health domains.;"Physical activity; health promotion; culture; AI; review methodology"

Its management poses a challenge for health systems, especially given the complexity of the factors that contribute to its chronicity and the need for safe, effective, and accessible therapeutic approaches. In this context, this research proposes the creation of a Care Pathway Protocol (CPP) that incorporates Traditional, Complementary, and Integrative Medicines (TCIM) in the care of patients with chronic pain, both in the active phase and in the prevention of pain chronicity, in comprehensive care practices from primary care to more specialized levels. These practices are organized according to the needs and preferences of users, focusing on a person-centered approach, continuous care, and interprofessional collaboration, with the aim of providing an evidence-informed guide for healthcare professionals in assisting patients with chronic pain.;The CPP is structured as a multimodal assistance model that promotes shared decision-making and organization of care processes for a defined group of patients with similar needs over a specified period, integrating conventional practices and integrative therapies, prioritizing non-pharmacological interventions and integrative and complementary practices. This is a methodological study based on a narrative review of the literature and analysis of national and international clinical guidelines, aiming to identify interventions with scientific support, applicable in the context of Brazilian public health. This work aims to answer the question: 'What are the available assistance resources from TCIM for the prevention and treatment of chronic pain based on evidence?'. The CPP was proposed from the perspective of clinical studies on the safety and effectiveness of integrative medicine interventions, considering different individual and collective care approaches, in a holistic manner to mitigate the progression of chronic pain and improve quality of life.;The results provide consistent evidence of the effectiveness of Integrative and Complementary Practices in pain reduction, improvement of quality of life, and promotion of well-being. The contribution of these practices to the reduction of the use of analgesics and opioids, prevention of iatrogenic issues, and strengthening of patient autonomy in self-care was also identified. The CPP proposes educational actions and collective practices, expanding user participation and integrating the community dimension of care. The CPP has the potential to enhance the organization of services, rationalize resource use, and facilitate the implementation of more effective care pathways. It aligns with the guidelines of the National Policy on Integrative and Complementary Practices and can contribute to the institutionalization of TCIM as an integral part of strategies for health promotion and prevention of chronic pain in the Brazilian public health.;The integrative CPP represents a strategic tool for reorganizing care for chronic pain, promoting safe, sustainable, and evidence-based practices. Its adoption can strengthen the bond between teams and users, prevent the chronicity of pain, reduce healthcare costs, and improve clinical and human outcomes. By recognizing the complexity of chronic pain and valuing the therapeutic diversity of Integrative Healthcare Practitioners, the CPP broadens the scope of care and reaffirms the commitment to a more comprehensive, welcoming, and effective health model.;"Chronic Pain; pain management; Alternative Therapies; Complementary and integrative practices"

It may be understood that with the growing developments of modern technology that accessing information on TCIM by stakeholders like patients, health providers, researchers and key decision makers; is more accessible. The barriers, limitations and use of the obtained information on TCIM as well as, how it is communicated and how it is used in practice amongst various stakeholders is, however, unclear.  
AIM: This literature review aims to understand the current landscape globally on the resources used for accessing information on TCIM and whether needs are met or unmet for people seeking information on TCIM.";METHODS:  A database search using CINAHL, Medline (Ovid), PubMed (Ovid), Scopus, and Amed, was undertaken to identify peer-reviewed original research articles published between 2010 through to September 2023. The search found 11 papers that met the selection criteria.;"RESULTS:  Overall, the results indicated several interconnected elements.  Participants feel overwhelmed with decisions about the use of TCIM and often found health providers are unable to help. Participants want more TCIM information and rely on non-preferred sources and non-evidenced-based sources when seeking information on TCIM. Some altered decision-making and changes to clinical practice were made after receiving evidenced-based information. The results found in this paper highlight deficiencies in the communication between patient and health provider, evidencing a culture of non-disclosure of TCIM amongst patients, with a varied exchange of information between stakeholders.  Although some insights to participant barriers, limitations, impacts and uses were found; the level of knowledge of TCIM amongst health providers were mainly dependant on confidence levels; and consultation time, health literacy, and resource access showed an impact to patient responses at the point of clinical practice.  More information is needed around TCIM use, knowledge and limitations at the health provider and patient level.";CONCLUSION:  Overall, very little is clear regarding the met and unmet needs of people looking to use TCIM.  There may be a growing momentum of TCIM integration into modern health systems and understanding health providers and patient level interactions around TCIM use seems to be an area lacking in clarity despite being a necessary part of an integration strategy.  More research is needed to improve the forward movement of integration and enhance the culture of communication, documentation, evaluation and advance health care systems among practitioner communities, on a global scale.;"Health-information seeking; traditional and complementary medicine; evaluation of complementary medicine; Traditional Complementary and Integrative Medicine; information source"

These practices emphasize empathetic listening, the establishment of therapeutic bonds, and the interconnectedness between the patient, the environment, and society. The adoption of such practices has increased significantly in recent years. This growth is primarily attributed to the rising demand for healthcare services driven by the high prevalence of chronic diseases and the persistent inequities in access to health services, particularly in relation to cost, quality, and care models. To outline the sociodemographic and clinical profile of individuals with chronic diseases receiving care through PICS, in order to understand their clinical needs and to promote comprehensive care and empathetic listening through qualified, multidisciplinary assistance.;This descriptive observational study, with both quantitative and qualitative approaches, is part of the project 'Mapping the health conditions of the Black population in the state of Bahia' (CAAE 47433421.5.0000.5662).

These entities are not perceived as myths or legends, but as real presences that teach and protect through oral tradition, rituals, songs, and dreams. In this context, spirituality and ancestry constitute legitimate forms of healthcare, as well as of knowledge production and transmission. ;This study aims to present the experience of the Lica Xukuru Memorial of Indigenous Medicine, an initiative that exemplifies the valorization of ancestral knowledge, the strengthening of health autonomy, and the articulation between Indigenous medical practices and conventional health systems. The development of this Indigenous medicine space is grounded in a qualitative approach that combines research with practical field-based actions, such as workshops, discussion circles, and other activities carried out in the Xukuru do Ororubá territory, in the state of Pernambuco. The initiative is the result of a partnership between the Federal University of Pernambuco (UFPE) and the Xukuru do Ororubá Indigenous Health Council.;"The Memorial is currently being implemented, and its creation pays tribute to Pajé Lica Xukuru, who passed into ancestry in August 2020 due to Covid-19. It is conceived as a space dedicated to the preservation and transmission of Indigenous medical knowledge of the Xukuru do Ororubá people. The Memorial includes a medicinal plant garden and a circular covered area for the exhibition of Lica Xukuru’s memory. It also serves as a venue for dialogue on Indigenous medicine with the Indigenous Multidisciplinary Health Teams (EMSI), local care practitioners, and gives special attention to the future training of Xukuru youth—referred to as the ""seeds"" of the Xukuru do Ororubá. To document the use of practices involving homemade remedies, a total of 55 Indigenous knowledge holders and 85 professionals from the EMSI were brought together between 2022 and 2023.

In Brazil, 41.7% of health professionals reported symptoms related to depression and anxiety. Studies show a close relationship between chronic pain and psychological distress, which directly impacts work performance and quality of life. Integrative and Complementary Practices in Health (PICS) have emerged as feasible, low-cost strategies within Primary Health Care (PHC) settings. This study aimed to describe the creation, implementation, and outcomes of an integrative protocol focused on stress and chronic pain management for healthcare professionals in a Family Health Strategy unit.;"A retrospective, descriptive study was conducted in a PHC unit in Barretos, Brazil. The “Integrated Health” protocol combined three interventions: (1) Pranayama breathing exercises; (2) auricular acupuncture following the NADA protocol; and (3) cervical myofascial release massage. Sessions were performed weekly for four weeks, lasting 30 minutes each. Thirty-four professionals participated voluntarily. Data were collected via a Google Forms questionnaire before and after the intervention, assessing sociodemographic data and self-perception of stress, pain, sleep, and well-being. Quantitative data were analyzed using Jamovi software; qualitative data were reviewed through thematic content analysis of open responses.";"Among the 34 participants, 41% reported a reduction in stress, 27% in pain, 23% improvement in vitality, and 9% better sleep quality. Additionally, 62% stated feeling highly stressed at work before the intervention. The qualitative analysis revealed recurring terms like ""relief,"" ""calm,"" and ""well-being"" in participants' feedback. The integrative protocol was well accepted, with no adverse effects reported. These findings align with international evidence supporting the effectiveness of the NADA protocol and integrative approaches in managing occupational stress and chronic pain. Although causality cannot be established due to the retrospective design, the consistent perception of benefits highlights the potential of integrating PICS into occupational health strategies within PHC services.";The “Integrated Health” protocol demonstrated positive outcomes in stress and pain reduction among healthcare workers in a primary care setting. These findings suggest that incorporating integrative practices is both feasible and effective, offering a low-cost, safe, and accessible alternative to support the well-being of health professionals. Further prospective studies, including randomized clinical trials, are recommended to validate these outcomes and support broader implementation in public health services.;"Primary Health Care; Integrative and complementary health practices; Healthcare Workers; Stress Management; Chronic Pain"

However, existing health policies have not adequately addressed the impacts associated with this work arrangement, especially in terms of physical, psychosocial, and emotional challenges. This study critically examines how the medical rationality of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), as endorsed by the World Health Organization’s strategies for Traditional, Complementary, and Integrative Medicine (TCIM), can contribute to the formulation of health policies tailored to teleworkers. The research focuses on a case study conducted within a Brazilian federal educational institution, the Instituto Federal do Paraná (IFPR).;This is a mixed-methods study that combines a descriptive quantitative approach with an exploratory qualitative design. Data will be collected through structured questionnaires developed by the researchers, based on previous studies on the psychosocial and physical impacts of telework. The target population consists of technical-administrative staff at the IFPR who are engaged in telework. Ethics committee approval is currently in progress. Concurrently, an integrative literature review will be conducted to explore the connections between TCM and public health policies, following PRISMA guidelines and incorporating a critical analysis of qualitative data. Guided by these findings, the study will propose an institutional health policy structured according to the public policy cycle framework—using the survey results to define the policy agenda and the literature review to guide policy formulation.;Preliminary findings suggest that teleworkers may be exposed to significant health risks, including extended working hours, emotional strain, technological overload, ergonomic issues, and psychosocial strains. Although still incipient, the literature indicates that principles of TCM—such as emotional balance, self-care,  preventive body–mind practices, and integrality in health—can be integrated into occupational health programs to promote workplace safety and well-being.;This research is expected to generate both theoretical and practical contributions for the development of health policies aligned with the realities of telework. Grounded in TCM principles, the proposed policy framework aims to support integrative institutional actions that promote the well-being of public servants in remote work settings. Ultimately, these findings may inform not only internal policy development but also broader debates on public health, integrative care, and the promotion of worker well-being in the context of evolving labor arrangements.;"Traditional Chinese Medicine; Health Policy; Teleworking"

Ayurveda, a traditional Indian system of medicine recognized by both the World Health Organization and Brazil as an integrative and complementary practice, holds extensive knowledge in treating insomnia using medicinal plants. Although there is no exact correspondence between the signs and symptoms described in Ayurveda and those in contemporary medicine, terms such as Anidra and Nidranasha are considered analogous to insomnia, with their etiology and therapeutic treatments well described. This study aimed to identify plant species with therapeutic potential for the treatment of insomnia that occur in Brazil.;The research methodology was based on a detailed literature review of the Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia of India, with the goal of identifying monographs of plant species indicated for Anidra/Nidranasha (insomnia). The vernacular names cited were transcribed, and the corresponding scientific names were confirmed using the Plants of the World Online (POWO) platform. The occurrence of these species in Brazil was verified through the databases of Flora e Funga do Brasil, POWO, SpeciesLink, and Dataplamt. For the selected monographs, information regarding the plant part used and pharmaceutical form was collected.;"The Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia of India comprises 10 volumes, which include a total of 665 monographs. Considering explicit indications for Anidra/Nidranasha, seven plant species were identified, distributed across volumes I, III, IV, and V: Cannabis sativa L. (Part used: leaf – Pharmaceutical form: powder), Cucumis sativus L. (Part used: seed – Pharmaceutical form: powder), Dicliptera paniculata (Forssk.) I.Darbysh (Part used: root – Pharmaceutical form: powder), Elaeocarpus angustifolius Blume (Part used: seed – Pharmaceutical form: not available), Hyoscyamus niger L. (Part used: seed – Pharmaceutical form: not available), Nardostachys jatamansi (D.Don) DC. (Part used: rhizome – Pharmaceutical form: powder | decoction) and Rauvolfia serpentina (L.) Benth. ex Kurz (Part used: dried aerial root – Pharmaceutical form: not available). Among these, four species occur in Brazil (Cannabis sativa L.; Cucumis sativus L.; Hyoscyamus niger L.; Rauvolfia serpentina (L.) Benth. ex Kurz), and none are indicated for insomnia in the complementary documents of the Brazilian Pharmacopoeia: the Formulário de Fitoterápicos and the Memento de Fitoterápicos.";Although two species do not have the pharmaceutical form described, the plant parts used are specified, and thus these findings may serve as a strategic tool for bioprospecting and the development of pharmacological studies aimed at validating their therapeutic potential. However, an important aspect to consider when evaluating pharmacological effects is the pharmacotechnics used in the preparation of Ayurvedic medicines, as there are significant differences in pharmaceutical practices between Brazil and India. Conducting studies that evaluate parameters related to efficacy and safety is crucial for the integration of medicinal plants, promoted by innovation grounded in traditional knowledge.;"Medicinal plants; ayurveda; insomnia; Ethnopharmacology; Pharmacopoeia"

(1) Narrative about the symptom and the initial experience of illness organized based on the contiguity of events;
(2) Prototypes related to health problems based on the interviewee's previous experience, focusing on similarities, differences and the description of the problem individuation process;
(3) Explanatory models, causal attributions, expectations regarding treatment, course and prognosis.
(4) Services (institutions, places of care, etc.) and response to the treatment obtained therein;
(5) Impact on life: this includes aspects related to values, the vicissitudes of living with the health problem in question.";"The existence of adherents and non-followers who seek, in this African-based religion, to solve health problems leads us to consider it as a complex medical system. Among the intervention actions of this ""medicine"" can be found approaches that seek to trigger natural and supernatural mechanisms of health promotion, privileging welcoming, the therapeutic bond and the subject's interaction with nature, enabling a holistic view of the health-disease process. Thus, ""medicine"", conceived by Candomblé, stands as an important option in the face of health care needs despite the primacy of the ""official health system"" and the marginal situation, whose association dates back to the historical process of religion. What becomes fascinating about this social manifestation is the primary importance that vegetables occupy in the worldview of the group in question.";"We believe this Project has contributed positively to understanding issues related to therapeutic practices in Candomblé, whose specificity lies in a particular modality and a worldview capable of accounting for the different processes within which health and disease phenomena are embedded. We reaffirm the importance of the Unified Health System (SUS) as a public health system, sensitive to ""religious medicines"" and establishing institutional partnerships aimed at aggregating knowledge and expertise for health promotion and reinforcing the importance of phytotherapy from this religious system in the public health system in Brazil.";"Unified Health System SUS; Candomblé; traditional medicine; integrality"

The mainstay of diabetes prevention for prediabetic people is lifestyle modification, which has been shown to reduce relative risk by 40% to 70%. The advantage of using medication is also recommended. No study has explored the role of Nisha Amalaki powder and Yoga practice as combined therapy for prediabetes.This study  aims to explore whether intervention with Nisha Amalaki powder and Yoga  could revert prediabetes to normal glycaemic status as the primary outcome.;A randomized controlled trial of Ayurvedic formulation Nisha Amalaki powder and Yoga for 12 weeks was conducted in Sir Sunder Lal hospital BHU. Total 74 diagnosed participants of Pre Diabetes with FBS 100-125 mg/dL were randomized into three groups( Nisha Amalaki powder and Yoga/ Nisha Amalaki powder/ Yoga). The Nisha Amalaki powder is a classical preparation that has mixture of turmeric and Indian gooseberry in equal ratio given in doses of 4 gm morning and evening with luke warm water. Yoga practice was administered as 1 hour online/offline session   including joint movements , Asanas, Pranayamas  and relaxation;"The individual undergoing the trial showed improvement in blood sugar valves. The combined therapy of Nisha Amalaki powder and Yoga practice had superior improvement in fasting  and post prandial blood sugar levels, HbA1c values, body mass index, cholesterol, and triglyceride levels compared to those receiving either Nisha Amalaki powder or Yoga practice alone.
The formulation Nisha Amalaki powder shows the effect by various mechanisms as increasing insulin sensitivity and glucose uptake by skeletal muscles, adipocytes inhibition of gluconeogenesis and decreasing oxidative stress. The diverse postures in yoga practice enhance the sensitivity of ?-cells to glucose, so augmenting insulin secretion. The joint movements along with postures increase blood flow to the muscles while promoting muscle relaxation, thereby facilitating improved glucose uptake. Parasympathetic activation and the associated anti-stress mechanisms of relaxation and Pranayam improve patients' overall metabolic and psychological profiles, in individuals with prediabetes. The combination of Nisha Amalaki powder with Yoga as mind body therapy further improves the effect in prediabetes.";Nishamalaki  and Yoga practice alone are promising interventions for the management of prediabetes. The combination of both interventions has shown even greater efficacy in reducing blood glucose and trigyceride levels and producing notable positive clinical outcomes. This study paves the way for large multicentric studies for the management of prediabetes and the prevention of diabetes in its early stages.;"prediabetes; yoga; ayurveda; Nishaamlaki"

It poses a significant public health challenge, often co-occurring with poor mental health. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of an 8-week Shabad Kriya meditation practice compared to an active control (relaxing reading) on insomnia severity, mental health, and quality of life outcomes.;A randomized clinical trial was conducted, approved by the UFMG Ethics Committee (COEP-UFMG: 60582522.5.0000.5149). From 1,262 screened individuals, 174 participants were randomized into a Meditation group (MG) or a Relaxing Reading control group (RG), with 87 in each. Participants with severe neurological, psychiatric, or clinical disorders, or those using insomnia medication, were excluded. Interventions were performed daily before sleep for 8 weeks. Outcomes were assessed at baseline (T0), post-intervention (T1), and at a 30-day follow-up (T2) using the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21), the World Health Organization Quality of Life-BREF (WHOQOL-BREF), and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). Data were analyzed using Wilcoxon and Mann-Whitney tests.;While both interventions improved insomnia severity from baseline, the MG demonstrated significantly greater improvement at the 30-day follow-up (T2) compared to the RG (p=0.038). This long-term benefit was underscored by clinical remission rates (ISI<8) in the MG, which increased from 26.31% at T1 to 28.07% at T2. The MG also showed significantly greater reductions in stress (DASS-21) at T1 (p=0.032) and T2 (p=0.01), and superior outcomes for depression (p=0.046) and environmental quality of life (p=0.037) at the T2 follow-up. Both interventions were equally effective in reducing immediate insomnia severity (T1), anxiety, and overall perceived stress. These findings align with robust published RCTs describing Kundalini Yoga's efficacy. Our results particularly highlight the delayed superiority of Shabad Kriya for insomnia and depression, suggesting it may foster deeper, more adaptive neurobiological changes than simple relaxation, a mechanism warranting further investigation.;Shabad Kriya meditation is an effective intervention, superior to relaxing reading for the long-term reduction of insomnia severity. It also confers sustained benefits for stress and long-term improvements in depression and environmental quality of life. Shabad Kriya represents a viable, evidence-informed TCIM strategy for addressing insomnia and its associated mental health comorbidities in the context of global public health.;"Meditation; Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders; Stress; Quality of Life; mental health"

Dental parafunction, acting as a precipitating factor for orofacial muscle dysfunction, often represents a significant etiological component of masticatory pain and dysfunction. The musculoskeletal system, particularly soft tissues, exhibits viscoelastic properties that allow for functional adaptation and structural reorganization in response to stressors such as dental clenching, aiming to maintain the biomechanical balance of the stomatognathic system. The osteopathic Mandibular Lift technique is proposed as a means for articular decompression of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ), pain relief, and improvement of masticatory function.;"This prospective, quantitative, experimental study investigated the effects of the osteopathic Mandibular Lift maneuver in 11 women aged 18 to 30 years.

In 1997 the National Program for the Development and Generalization of Natural and Traditional Medicine was adopted, after several efforts starting in 1991. ;A review of the NMT's political, legal and regulatory framework was carried out. The main indicators related to this health program at the end of 2024 were also reviewed. ;"Cuba recognizes Natural and Traditional Medicine as a medical specialty, with a holistic and integrative approach to health problems using methods of health promotion, disease prevention, diagnosis, treatment and rehabilitation which come from traditional medical systems and other therapeutic modalities that are integrated with each other and with conventional treatments from modern Western Medicine. NTM includes Acupuncture, Phytotherapy, Apitherapy, Homeopathy, Flower Therapy, Ozone Therapy, Traditional Exercises, Medical Hydrology, Sun-Thalassotherapy, Natural Nutrition and more recently Ayurveda. 
There is a political, legal and regulatory framework for the development of NTM in the country. Today an Agreement from the Council of Ministers, as well as several resolutions from the Ministry of Public Health and regulations from the Center for the State Control of Medicines, Equipments and Medical Devices (CECMED, for its Spanish acronym) support the development of NTM in the National Health System (NHS). Also, the Public Health Act is currently being updated, and it incorporates elements related to NTM given its growing importance. By the end of 2024 the Cuban Basic List of Natural Products included 179 items, with a global production of 102.713.745 units of these products. NTM treatments were integrated at the three levels of the NHS for 61.304.218 patients, 81.5% of them at the primary care level. Medical education is guaranteed with different training programs, including a residency for Medical Doctors, with 175 residents and 376 doctors specialized in NTM by the end of 2024 in Cuba. The Ministry of Public Health's NTM Department, in conjunction with the Central Pharmacology Laboratory of the Havana Medical University, coordinates a Sectoral Program for Research in Natural and Traditional Medicine. The program has accepted 56 research projects until 2024, most of them related to medicinal plants and natural products.

The initial search yielded 3,805 articles (Scopus: 1,621; PubMed/MEDLINE: 882; Embase: 572; Web of Science: 437; PsycINFO: 229; BVS/LILACS: 41; Cochrane: 23). After removing 1,349 duplicates, 2,456 unique records were screened. Inclusion criteria focused on RCTs that evaluated music at 432 Hz and/or 440 Hz for psychological and symptom outcomes in populations with mental health conditions. Four RCTs met the full eligibility criteria and were included in the final analysis. The methodological quality of these studies was assessed using the Jadad scale.";The included studies generally demonstrated a low risk of bias, with an average Jadad score of four out of five. Overall, all four RCTs reported positive and significant effects of music interventions on mental health symptoms, particularly in reducing anxiety and stress. The studies that directly compared frequencies found that music tuned to 432 Hz was significantly more effective than 440 Hz in lowering anxiety and physiological stress markers, such as salivary cortisol. Additional benefits associated with 432 Hz music included improvements in vital signs (e.g., respiratory rate and systolic blood pressure) and self-reported productivity. While these findings are promising, the current evidence is limited by the small number of studies, which are predominantly focused on situational anxiety in the context of dental procedures.;Music tuned to 432 Hz shows potential as a therapeutic resource, demonstrating superior effects compared to the standard 440 Hz tuning in managing anxiety and physiological stress responses in the available evidence. This review highlights the promise of 432 Hz music as an accessible and cost-effective intervention for emotional and psychological support. However, the scarcity of robust studies underscores the critical need for more rigorous, large-scale RCTs across diverse populations to validate these findings and establish definitive clinical guidelines.;"Music Therapy; Sound Therapy; mental health; Anxiety; psychological stress"

This reduction is linked to increased mortality in both dilated and ischemic cardiomyopathy. However, HRV patterns, respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), and HRV biofeedback (HRV-Bfb) have not been thoroughly studied in patients with left ventricular assist devices (LVADs). We therefore conducted a feasibility pilot study in 11 patients with LVADs to analyze HRV under standardized conditions. Additionally we were interested in the influence of breathing patterns on the pulsatility of the pulsewave (earlobe).;"Eleven LVAD outpatients underwent HRV assessment under standardized conditions using the “HRV-Scanner” system (Biosign, Germany). The protocol included three phases:
1.	One-minute RSA at six breaths per minute using a visual pacer,
2.	Five-minute resting HRV,
3.	Three-minute HRV-Bfb session with guided deep breathing.
Time domain analysis (TDA) involved SDNN and RMSSD measurements across all phases. Frequency domain analysis (FDA) was applied during resting HRV and included high-frequency (HF), low-frequency (LF) power, and LF/HF ratio.
";"The patients (mean age 57; 10 male) mostly had non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (NIDCM, n=8), with one DCM and two ICM cases. Ten had pacemakers. The following additional data are shown as mean and standard deviations (SD): BMI: 30 (7), Sys BP: 96 (15), Dia BP: 70 (14); Heart rate: 75/min (10); LVEDD: 6.7 (1.3); RVEDD: 3.1 (0.3); EF: 21 (9); LVAD Speed: 9276 (452); LVAD Flow: 5.3 (0.9); LVADPI: 6.3 (1.2); LVAD Wattage: 5.6 (1.3). TDA for condition 1-3: SDNN: 19.3 (10); 17.5 (10.4); 20.6 (13.0) and RMSSD: 11.8 (3.2); 15.1 (7.3); 16.7 (8.7). FDA for condition 2:  HF: 15.5 (11.0); LF: 13.0 (10.1), LF/HF Quotient: 1.0 (0.6).  
Deep breathing influenced the pulse wave signal in 8/10 patients (condition 3). Four patients had too many extrasystoles to analyze HRV.
";LVAD patients exhibit reduced HRV, but HRV-Bfb and deep breathing may enhance SDNN and influence pulse wave patterns. These early results support further investigation into the role of HRV-Bfb and respiratory training in this patient group.;"Heart Rate Variability; Biofeedback; Heart failure"

This study evaluated the impact of an integrative oncology (IO) intervention on autonomic nervous system activity, using heart rate variability (HRV) as a biomarker.;In this prospective, randomized, controlled, and pragmatic trial, oncology and/or palliative care patients were assessed for cancer- and war-related quality of life (QoL) effects. Participants were randomized to receive a 30-minute manual-relaxation session either with (Group A) or without acupuncture (Group B). HRV and heart rate were monitored in 3-minute intervals, spanning from pre-treatment to 15 minutes post-treatment. Frequency-domain HRV parameters—such as Power Total, Power HF, Power LF, and Power VLF—were analyzed between the groups. Time-domain metrics included RMSSD and SDNN.;"Of 125 enrolled participants, 91 had high-quality HRV data (Group A: 53; Group B: 38). Heart rate significantly declined in both groups, with a more notable reduction in Group B (p=0.005). LN Power Total decreased more in Group A (p=0.006), predominantly through reductions in LN Power LF (p=0.02) and LN Power VLF (p=0.026), along with a significant rise in Relative Power HF (p=0.009). No significant differences emerged in time-domain parameters.";Patients undergoing oncology care during wartime exhibited a reduction in heart rate, indicative of heightened parasympathetic activity. The addition of acupuncture to manual-relaxation therapy was associated with HRV changes suggestive of reduced sympathetic activity. Additional studies are warranted to explore the effects of this combined approach in other oncological care environments.;"acupuncture; Heart Rate Variability; Oncology"

Women's health at 40 years of age and older during the climacteric stage has increasingly become a focus of interest due to the growing possibilities for physical, mental, and psychological well-being. Various symptoms begin to manifest as a result of the decline in estrogen and progesterone levels, leading to a clinical picture marked by complexities that affect quality of life on multiple levels. These include infertility and low libido; female sexual dysfunction caused by antidepressant medications; sexual desire disorder or hypoactive sexual desire; joint pain, hot flashes, insomnia, anxiety, and night sweats, among others.
Peruvian Maca (Lepidium meyenii) has been one of the most widely used plants in addressing the needs of this population, with growing interest in its potential as a dietary supplement and for its medicinal properties.

Objective: This study aimed to analyze the therapeutic effects of Peruvian Maca (Lepidium meyenii) in women aged 40 and over, focusing on climacteric symptoms.";The method implemented was a systematic review conducted following PRISMA guidelines using the PubMed, Virtual Health Library (BVS), and EMBASE databases.;"A total of 56 studies were identified, of which 7 articles were selected that covered different scenarios where Peruvian Maca benefits women's health during the climacteric stage. Among these studies:

•	One reported the use of antidepressants in postmenopausal women and the positive response of Maca in improving sexual function and alleviating symptoms such as depression and anxiety;
•	One highlighted the reduction of psychological symptoms during menopause, while noting that Maca does not exert estrogenic effects;
•	Three studies confirmed the reduction of physiological discomforts associated with menopause and improvements in bone density markers;
•	One addressed improvements in joint pain;
•	And one emphasized that Maca root may help alleviate social anxiety disorders as women age.";The use of Peruvian Maca (Lepidium meyenii) may represent a promising and valuable option for women aged 40 and over in managing climacteric symptoms.;"Lepidium meyenii; climacteric; Perimenopause; menopause; postmenopause"

This study aimed to evaluate baseline knowledge in awareness of planetary health among medical educators following an interactive educational intervention.;An interactive workshop was conducted with medical school faculty, including a lecture entitled “Planetary Health, the Climate Crisis, and Its Repercussions on Health.” Participants completed pre- and post-intervention questionnaires. The McNemar test was used to assess changes in categorical responses, and internal consistency was measured using Cronbach’s alpha.;Among participants, 50% had previously heard the term “Planetary Health,” and only one (6.25%) had attended an event on the topic. Cronbach’s alpha was 0.81, indicating good reliability. Before the session, 43.75% reported understanding the concept of planetary health, 12.5% felt able to identify its relevance in medical education, 37.5% reported knowledge of climate change, 50% of air pollution, and 56.25% of social determinants of health. After the workshop, these percentages increased to 75% (p=0.007), 75% (p=0.0005), 87.5% (p=0.07), 87.5% (p=0.2), and 87.5% (p=0.0008), respectively.;The interactive workshop significantly improved participants' awareness of planetary health and its relevance to medical education.

This study is part of a set of Evidence Maps on Traditional Medicines, aimed at promoting evidence-informed policies. ;"Studies were identified in the principal databases (PubMed, the VHL Regional Portal, and
Embase) up to 2024 and selection was indepnedently realized by blinded revieweres at Rayyan. Redcap was used to extract data by trained reviewers. Methodological quality was assessed using the AMSTAR 2 tool, with discrepancies resolved by consensus. These Evidence Maps provide comprehensive overviews of clinical evidence supporting the use of Ayurveda and Yoga in healthcare.

";"In the Ayurveda Evidence Map, 172 studies were screened for eligibility, with 78 included in the final map. From these: nine categories of health outcomes were identified.
In the Yoga Evidence Map, 317 studies were included, with confidence levels assessed. From these, Outcomes were classified into seven groups.
These Maps reveal significant insights into their impact across various health conditions, particularly concerning metabolic health, mental well-being, cognitive performance, pain management.
Regarding metabolic syndrome, both Ayurveda and Yoga show promising results. In Ayurveda research, cardiovascular and metabolic disorders constituted a substantial 35.5% of the health outcomes studied, indicating a strong focus on these conditions and demonstrating positive effects. Similarly, for Yoga, metabolic and physiological indicators represented 25.6% of outcomes, with nutritional, metabolic, and lymphatic diseases making up an additional 2.5%, showcasing Yoga's positive and potentially positive influence on metabolic markers. Specifically for diabetes mellitus, both maps consistently show that it's a well-studied condition, with both Ayurveda and Yoga demonstrating positive effects. 
Mental health is prominent area of research for both both disciplines. Ayurveda studies on mental health outcomes represented 21.8% of the total, suggesting its application in addressing various mental health conditions. Yoga's impact on mental disorders is even more pronounced, accounting for 27.0% of outcomes, with studies showing positive effects on conditions like schizophrenia. Closely related to mental health is cognitive performance. Overall, the evidence maps give positive results, reinforcing its effectiveness.





";"Both Ayurveda and Yoga demonstrate significant potential in addressing the specified health conditions. The evidence maps highlight the therapeutic benefits of these practices, particularly in metabolic disorders, mental health, and pain management. These findings strongly encourage the use of yoga and Ayurvedic products/formulations for children and adolescents.
However, there is a need for more high-quality research, especially in Ayurveda, to further validate these findings. The comprehensive data provided by these maps can contribute to the integration of Ayurveda and Yoga into mainstream healthcare.
In conclusion, the Ayurveda Evidence Map and the Yoga Evidence Map offer valuable insights into the clinical applications of these traditional healthcare systems. For a more detailed understanding of the methodologies, specific interventions, and comprehensive results, the full reports of both the Ayurveda Evidence Map and the Yoga Evidence Map are accessible on the Virtual Health Library of Traditional, Complementary, and Integrative Medicines website: https://mtci.bvsalud.org/pt/mapas-de-evidencia-2/

While countries such as China and India have long-established national pharmacopoeias to support the documentation, regulation, and economic development of their medicinal plant resources, the Americas have yet to consolidate their rich ethnobotanical traditions into a coordinated reference system. This abstract presents the Caribbean islands contribution to this effort, drawing on data and methodology from TRAMIL (Traditional Medicines in the Islands), a well-established program that has documented and scientifically evaluated medicinal plant use across the Caribbean Basin for over four decades.
This review was undertaken in response to the conference organizers’ request to identify Caribbean native species for which some level of evidence from human studies is available.";"TRAMIL employs a ten-step methodology encompassing community-based identification of health priorities, statistically representative ethnopharmacological surveys, botanical authentication, critical literature review, and original pharmacological or toxicological studies when needed. This process results in classification of uses as [SIG] (significant use), [REC] (recommended use), or [TOX] (toxic use). 
For this review, all [SIG] native species reported in 19 island territories were reviewed, and a structured PubMed search was conducted to identify peer-reviewed human studies. Filters included randomized clinical trials, clinical trials, observational studies, and case reports involving humans. 
Species were classified based on native distribution as follows: native to both Caribbean island(s) and bordering continental countries (N); native exclusively to continental countries surveyed that border the Caribbean Sea (NEC); native exclusively to the Caribbean island territories surveyed (NEI). While NEC species are included for context, this review focuses on species from Caribbean island territories (N and NEI).";TRAMIL surveys across both island and continental territories have identified 273 [SIG] medicinal plant species, of which 167 are native. Among these, 36 native species were found to have at least one peer-reviewed human-use study. Eighteen of these are native to both Caribbean islands and continental countries bordering the Caribbean Sea (N), occurring in at least one of the island territories surveyed. One species is native exclusively to the islands (NEI). The five species with the greatest number of published human studies are Phyllanthus amarus (14 studies), Phyllanthus niruri (8), Capsicum frutescens (6), Bidens pilosa (5), and Senna alata (5). These results underscore the high research and therapeutic potential of several culturally important species and justify their potential prioritization for detailed Pan-American monograph development.;TRAMIL’s systematic, territory-based approach offers a tested model for integrating traditional knowledge with biomedical evidence. The contribution from the Caribbean islands is a foundational part of the first volume of the Pan-American Compendium and illustrates the importance of documenting, validating, and elevating native species across the Americas. In the absence of a unified pharmacopeia for the Pan-American region, this initiative marks a critical step toward building inclusive, evidence-based TCIM policy and unlocking the health and economic potential of its diverse medicinal flora.;"Medicinal plants; Ethnopharmacology; Caribbean Region; evidence-based practice; TRAMIL"

As students grapple with existential questions about life, purpose, and the future, many seek support for the psychological distress that can accompany this period. Bibliotherapy, a complementary therapy involving the guided reading of selected materials, has emerged as a promising intervention. This scoping review aims to map the existing literature on the use of bibliotherapy to improve the mental health of university students.;"A scoping review was conducted across seven health science databases: MEDLINE/PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, LILACS/BVS, Scopus, Web of Science, and PsycInfo. The search strategy used keywords related to ""Bibliotherapy"" and ""University Students"". The initial search yielded 2,661 references (PubMed: 597; Embase: 764; Scopus: 651; Web of Science: 323; PsycInfo: 200; LILACS/BVS: 67; Cochrane: 1). After screening for duplicates and relevance, 50 articles were selected for full-text review.";"Preliminary results from the ongoing review highlight several key themes. Bibliotherapy is frequently presented as a lower-cost intervention compared to conventional psychotherapies, enhancing its accessibility. It is widely applied within established frameworks such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and Positive Psychology. Notably, evidence suggests that reading physical books and listening to audiobooks is more effective for reducing anxiety and depression than reading digital or image-based books. Self-help books are the most commonly used tool in bibliotherapy interventions for this population. These findings underscore the potential of bibliotherapy as a scalable and accessible mental health support strategy for university students.
";Bibliotherapy is a growing field with promising evidence supporting its application for improving the mental well-being of university students. This scoping review provides a comprehensive map of the current evidence, identifying key characteristics of interventions, common therapeutic frameworks, and effective delivery formats. Further analysis will help consolidate the understanding of this valuable complementary therapy.;"Bibliotherapy; mental health; Students; Universities"

However, the actual offer of such practices in maternity services remains unclear. This study aimed to map the availability and types of CIHP reported by public maternity hospitals in Brazil, based on secondary data sources.;This observational, documentary analysis was based on information available in the e-Gestor AB platform (Ministry of Health, Brazil) and official technical manuals published between 2018 and 2024. Data were extracted regarding CIHP modalities registered by maternity units in all regions of Brazil. Descriptive analysis was performed to assess geographical distribution and prevalence of practices such as auriculotherapy, aromatherapy, massage, and acupuncture.;Among 312 public maternity services registered on the national database, 124 (39.7%) reported offering at least one CIHP. Aromatherapy (21.5%) and massage therapy (19.3%) were the most frequent, followed by acupuncture (12.8%) and Reiki (8.9%). Regional differences were notable: the Southeast concentrated 46% of all services reporting CIHPs, while the North region had the lowest representation (4%). The findings suggest uneven access to CIHPs in obstetric care across Brazil, reflecting challenges in training, institutional support, and funding.;This study demonstrates the partial implementation of CIHPs in maternity care, highlighting the need for investment in capacity-building, policy enforcement, and equity in access.

OBJECTIVE: To develop a conceptual-analytical model for implementing a social enterprise in integrative and community health, as well as an impact evaluation strategy.
";"This study employed a model development and implementation design with participatory methodology. The process involved three integrated phases: (1) narrative literature review on integrative health, community health, and complex health systems; (2) expert consultation with specialists in integrative health, community health, and the Unified Health System (SUS); and (3) integration of theoretical components with local territorial diagnoses using participatory methodology with community stakeholders. Theoretical models were articulated to address territorial diagnoses, aligned with a territorial impact theory of change developed through field studies and population research in the project's microregion. Impact indicators were designed to monitor key aspects of the theory of change, prioritizing validated metrics when available.
";"The model proposes organizing care processes through a transdisciplinary, territorialized, and person-centered approach, integrating individual and collective actions operating simultaneously at biopsychosocial and ecosystem levels. The framework comprises three main components: (1) health education and collective, culturally appropriate activities; (2) the ""Journey of Care""—individual and group care by an interprofessional team; and (3) territorial articulation mobilizing community stakeholder networks, from SUS health service providers to community movements and leaders. These manifest as ""light care technologies""—support network activation, health literacy, supported self-care, individualized care plans, integrative pharmaceutical care, multidimensional evaluation, and traditional, complementary, and integrative medicines. The model culminated in a comprehensive registry system with validated metrics for each dimension and a multiprofessional clinical record specifically designed for the theoretical framework. The conceptual framework integrates ecological systems theory and a multidimensional view of human health across multiple levels used in the transdisciplinary approach. Environmental and societal levels comprise the macrosystem (socioeconomic and environmental determinants), exosystem (working and living conditions), and mesosystem (social and community networks). At the person level, it includes supramental, mental/emotional, vital, metabolic, and physical dimensions. Salutogenic lifestyle serves as an intermediary level linking collective and individual health-disease dimensions.

Injectable ultra-dilutions of the aqueous extract of Viscum album L. (Va) have been used as an integrative approach in treating cancer patients. However, the effects of high-dilutions derived from alcoholic extracts have not been thoroughly investigated. Recently, in vivo studies by the Onco-homeopathy group at Universidade Paulista using Va ultra-dilutions derived from alcoholic Va extract obtained from the host tree Quercus robur (VaQr) at a potency of five fifty-thousandths (5LM) showed improvements in weight, quality of life, and survival rates in melanoma-bearing mice. This study aimed to evaluate the use of VaQr 5LM in canine patients with malignant tumors, to assess the benefits of this therapy in combination with chemotherapy.;Dogs diagnosed with câncer and undergoing chemotherapy were treated orally with VaQr at a potency of 5LM, with the consente of their owners. The treatment involved administering five drops twice daily for 30 days, with assessments made on the day of treatment initiation (DO), at 15 days (D15), and 30 days after starting treatment. Quality of life was assessed based on the Pawspice score, and the plausibility of a causal relationship between VaQr use and the observed clinical effects was evaluated using the modified Naranjo Criteria for Homeopathy (Ethics Committee approval FMU N° 9298270424).;"The sample included nine dogs of different breeds, with a predominance of mongrels (33.3%), and a mean age of 10.5 years. Using repeated-measures ANOVA, no significant difference was found in the owners' subjective assessments over time [F(2,16) = 0.482, p = 0.626]. The Pawspice score indicated a significant difference in scores over time (Friedman: ?² = 9.07; p = 0.0107). However, a post hoc analysis was performed to confirm the result and indicated a trend of improvement from D0 to D15 (p = 0.065). Simultaneously, laboratory tests of hematological parameters and liver function assessment revealead no significant changes, reinforcing its safety. The application of the Naranjo Criteria indicated a ""probable"" relationship in six dogs, while no causal relationship was identified in three, indicating individual variations in treatment response.";This study is the first to report the use of oral VaQr 5LM as an adjuvant to chemotherapy in dogs with cancer, highlighting its potential as a safe integrative medication for patients with neoplasia.;"cancer; Quercus robur; high-diluted preparations; Integrative Medicine; Quality of Life"

They are well accepted by the population for prophylactic, curative, or palliative purposes. They possess a range of therapeutic effects with scientifically proven pharmacological activities, including in dentistry. Brazil has a rich biodiversity and great potential for innovation in the development of new plant-based products for the health market, especially in dentistry, where various inventions can fall into the category of cosmetics, such as toothpastes and mouthwashes.The objective was to investigate medicinal plants used in dentistry for dental health care, focusing on their anti-inflammatory action in the oral cavity.;" A literature review was conducted using the Scielo and PubMed databases, in both English and Portuguese, in 2024, with the descriptors: phytotherapy, periodontal diseases, and oral cavity. Regarding periodontitis, the use of medicinal plants and their formulations is recommended. This is justified by the fact that it is a multifactorial disease involving a wide variety of microorganisms inhabiting the oral cavity, along with oxidative stress resulting from the host’s metabolic processes and immune defense mechanisms. Mechanical oral injuries facilitate the spread of pathogens and intensify inflammatory processes and, consequently, increase oxidative stress. In this context, the use of medicinal plants and their derivatives is especially relevant for vulnerable patients, such as those with lupus, HIV, hepatitis, diabetes, etc. This is because safe-use plants, as recommended by the Pharmacopoeia when used in the indicated dosage, serve as important prophylactic measures for oral hygiene care. These plants have clinical evidence supporting their use and are validated by ANVISA for inclusion in the Unified Health System (SUS), highlighting their relevance in periodontal treatments and expanding the possibilities for maintaining oral health.
";The literature review highlights their use for controlling microbial growth, reducing biofilm formation, decreasing oxidative stress, exerting anti-inflammatory action, and reducing gingival bleeding. In dentistry, they can be incorporated into products such as mouthwashes, gels, dentifrice oils, aqueous extracts, oral bioadhesives, or dental-use powders. The main medicinal plants described in the literature were: Vachellia nilotica subsp. tomentosa, Aloe vera, Azadirachta indica, Curcuma longa, Cymbopogon citratus, Camellia sinensis, Ocimum tenuiflorum, and Sempervivum ruthenicum. Their properties include anti-inflammatory, antiplaque, anti-halitosis, antiresorptive, antioxidant, antibacterial, antifungal, and antiviral effects. Among these, only Aloe vera (babosa) and Curcuma longa are listed in the National List of Medicinal Plants of Interest to the Unified Health System (RENISUS) and the 6th Edition of the Brazilian Pharmacopoeia.;"More clinical studies on the applications of medicinal plants and herbal medicines in dentistry are needed. Comparative studies on the best pharmaceutical forms for each oral pathology are also important. More clinical studies on the applications of medicinal plants and herbal medicines in dentistry are needed. Comparative studies on the best pharmaceutical forms for each oral pathology are also important. Another key factor is the identification and recognition of traditional plants used in dentistry by Indigenous peoples, quilombolas, and other traditional Brazilian communities. In Brazilian legislation, these populations are knowledge holders and must receive a fair share of benefits.

effective control.";Is a controlled clinical trial of paired samples that included 50 subjects.Was carried out in the neurology unit of the Hospital de Clínicas, it is a national reference hospital located in La Paz city, Bolivia country. Baseline measurements of pain perception, depression levels, electroencephalogram (EEG) tracing, and biofield activity were recorded. The experimental group received three Reiki sessions, while the control group underwent dietary training. Follow-up assessments were conducted over 12 months.;"T-student test was performed for the variables neuropathic pain, Hamilton scale values, biofield size and balance. The results are: p = 0.000005 were obtained for the pain variable, p value of 0.0000005 for the depression variable, p value of 1 for the electroencephalogram tracing variable, p value of 0.000005 for the biofield balance variables, and p value of 0.00005 for the biofield size variable.

Other reports by the patients were: 62% reported improved sleep, 87% reported less irritability, 97% reported a feeling of comfort associated with relaxation, 25% reported improved appetite. No harmful or side effects were reported.";Reiki, as a non-invasive energy therapy, generates a variety of benefits in the patient that are beyond the painful crisis, such as those reported in sleep and appetite, as well as providing relaxation and decreased irritability. These changes can lead us to think about a central regulation on which sleep and appetite regulation could depend. The change in attitude and relaxation are undoubtedly qualities that will help the patient in any nosological picture;"Neuropathic; Pain; Reiki; Energy; effectiveness"

However, it is unclear whether SRs focused on yoga assess CoE. The objective of this project was to determine the prevalence and characteristics of CoE assessment in SRs of yoga for health.;We searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, MEDLINE (Ovid), EMBASE (Ovid), AMED (Ovid), CINAHL (EBSCO) and PsycINFO (EBSCO) for SRs which assessed the randomized controlled trial (RCT) evidence on yoga interventions for health. All records were uploaded to Covidence, deduplicated, and screened independently by two authors. Data on SR characteristics and assessments of CoE were extracted independently by two authors, and discrepancies were resolved by discussion. Descriptive analyses were conducted using JASP 0.19.3 software.;"Searches retrieved 3,390 records, of which 250 described SRs of yoga for health. SRs were published between 2005 and 2024 and the majority (151/250; 60%) were published by authors from China, Germany, India, or the USA. Among SRs with at least one included RCT, 43/245 (18%) assessed CoE, and among the 145 SRs conducting a meta-analysis, 35/145 (24%) assessed CoE. However, several SRs (5/43; 12%) did not conduct an appropriate CoE assessment (e.g., applied a CoE rating to an individual study or to the SR as a whole rather than to a result). After the first SR with CoE in 2012, there was no clear increase in the percentage of SRs with CoE in more recent years. However, SRs published in journals with no journal impact factor (JIF) or a current JIF below 2 were least likely to assess CoE (7/83; 8%), while SRs published in journals with a current JIF of 5 or greater were most likely to assess CoE (13/27; 48%). The most common method cited for assessing CoE was the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach recommended by Cochrane (36/43; 84%) and the most commonly cited domains for assessment were risk of bias, imprecision, and inconsistency. However, not all SRs clearly identified the CoE tool or listed the domains that were assessed.";Fewer than 25% of SRs of yoga for health assessed CoE, and not all of them did so correctly. Education on the importance of CoE, how to assess CoE, and how to interpret ratings of CoE is needed. Such interventions may help to increase the appropriate use of CoE and improve the usefulness and impact of evidence from SRs, which will support appropriate decision-making among clinicians and consumers considering using yoga to support health and well-being.;"yoga; Systematic Reviews; Certainty of the Evidence"

These maps synthesize data from systematic reviews to illuminate the research landscape, identify evidence gaps, and provide recommendations for future research and evidence?informed public policy.;We conducted a systematic analytical study of Evidence Gap Maps (EGMs) on Traditional, Complementary, and Integrative Medicine (TCIM) developed by CABSIN and BIREME. EGMs published between 2019-2024 were identified through CABSIN and BIREME repositories using inclusion criteria of publication within five years, methodological transparency, complete datasets, and TCIM focus. Two independent reviewers extracted data using standardized forms, with discrepancies resolved by consensus. EGMs were categorized as Outcome Maps (condition-focused), Intervention Maps (modality-focused), and Population Maps (demographic-focused). Extracted variables included search strategies, number of systematic reviews, intervention categories, outcomes, findings, and recommendations. Data synthesis utilized Rayyan for screening, Tableau for visualization, REDCap for management, with intervention-outcome associations mapped and quantified across all EGMs. Systematic review quality was evaluated using AMSTAR 2 and PRISMA 2020 guidelines, while informetric and visual design aspects were assessed for research impact and accessibility. Quantitative analysis identified patterns in intervention-outcome associations and evidence gaps, while qualitative analysis examined research priorities and policy implications, with results stratified by intervention type, population, and clinical outcomes.;"Results: Twenty-four TCIM EGM together report 353 intervention–outcome associations across clinically relevant endpoints from 2440 systematic reviews. The four Outcome Maps address TCIM contributions in times of COVID?19, clinical effectiveness for uterine cancer, chronic pain, and cardiovascular diseases. The 19 Intervention Maps are organized into four groups: Natural Products (Herbal Medicine, Brazilian Medicinal Plants, Medicinal Cannabis, Apitherapy and Aromatherapy); Traditional Whole Medical Systems (Acupuncture, Cupping Therapy, Moxibustion, and Traditional Chinese Medicine Mind–Body Practices, Auriculotherapy); Non?Traditional Whole Medical Systems (Homeopathy and Anthroposophic Medicine); and Non?Pharmacological Interventions (Meditation, Yoga, Shantala, and Reflexology). The Population Map focuses on TCIM interventions for the aged, incorporating 54 systematic reviews that evaluated low?cost, low?technology interventions (e.g. Tai Chi, Qi Gong, traditional Chinese exercise, acupuncture, meditation, and yoga) and reporting more than 100 positive or promising associations with outcomes such as balance, quality of life, physical function, and cognitive performance. ";Conclusion: CABSIN’s and BIREME EGMs provide a comprehensive overview of the global TCIM evidence landscape. Despite a considerable research volume, notable gaps exist in methodological rigor, standardization of outcome measures, and representation of vulnerable populations. These findings support the need for further high?quality systematic reviews and more geographically diverse research to guide future policy and practice in integrative health.;"Sinthesis of evidence; evidence gap map; Systematic literature review"

A growing variety of clinical diagnostics depend on identifying the different characteristics of pain, and on engaging pain management strategies effective for each patient. Faced with such an increasing request, and with the escalating acknowledgment of collateral effects of pain-killers drugs, alternative approaches emerge, including music therapy, recognized for its remarkable ability to relief pain. The International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) recently reformulated the concept of pain, thereby broadening our understanding of pain as an individual experience, shaped by internal and external factors. Concomitantly, recent insights suggest that listening and/or producing harmonious sounds may affect the entire individual, not being restricted to auditory perceptual-cognitive cerebral networks. Thereby, music may contribute significantly to pain reduction and improvement of vital signs, impacting on emotional and relational states. Music therapy emerges as an effective, low-cost, and virtually side-effect-free integrative approach, acting on all biopsychosocial dimensions. Given the prevalence of chronic pain and its impact on public health, this review aims at reflecting on the use of music in painful experiences, and, specifically, at exploring the role of music and vibroacoustic music therapy.;"This study reviews selected reference works and recent scientific articles debating the concepts of pain, music, and the relationship between them. Influential authors such as Kenneth Bruscia and Lia Rejane Barcellos were highlighted for theoretical grounding; and pioneering studies by Olav Skille, Tony Wigram or Simone Vitale were selected to discuss vibroacoustic techniques.";Understanding pain as a complex experience is fundamental to expand therapeutic possibilities. As a non-invasive intervention, music interferes with both pain perception and associated emotions. Musical stimuli affect cortical and subcortical areas, being able to modulate pain responses through distraction, relaxation, or interaction with the pleasure system. According to World Federation of Music Therapy (WFMT), receptive or productive music therapies employ multiple sound qualities to promote multidimensional health of the mind/body. In the receptive model, passive music listening may reduce pain and anxiety. Recent studies revealed significant reductions in stress and cortisol levels. Vibroacoustic music therapy, on the other hand, uses low-frequency sinusoidal sounds applied to the body, promoting deep relaxation, autonomic nervous system regulation, and pain relief. In addition to its physiological effects, sound is also seen as an energetic resource, with the potential for physical, emotional, and spiritual balance through systems such as chakras or acupuncture points.;Music and sound production, when used therapeutically, prove effective for pain modulation and holistic human care. Music therapy, especially in its vibroacoustic aspect, expands therapeutic avenues, promoting relief, emotional reorganization, and well-being. Despite significant advances from a biomedical perspective, it remains there a scarcity of studies from a genuinely music therapeutic perspective, which reinforces the need for more research to embrace its deep mechanisms and broaden its recognition in the healthcare field.;"pain management; relieving pain; Music Therapy; Vibroacoustic music therapy"

However, nations face diverse challenges in achieving this integration, particularly in developing regulatory frameworks and public policies for TCIM. Objective: To identify and analyze the existing literature on how TCIM has been implemented and integrated into health systems and services in selected countries of the Americas and other key regions.;A scoping review was conducted following the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) guidelines. The review included indexed articles, technical documents, and theses addressing the implementation, coordination, and integration of TCIM within the health systems and services of Chile, Mexico, Ecuador, Peru, Cuba, Nicaragua, Brazil, Colombia, Italy, Switzerland, France, England, China, India, Australia, and South Africa. Searches were performed in the PubMed and VHL TCIM Americas databases. The initial screening and selection were independently carried out by two researchers using the Rayyan platform. Documents published between 1995 and 2022 in Spanish, Portuguese, or English that met the inclusion criteria were considered. A second screening and data extraction were conducted using Excel.;The search strategy yielded 3,592 records, of which 438 were selected during the initial screening. An analytical matrix was developed to classify the documents. Information was extracted from abstracts, followed by a secondary screening and categorization according to predefined themes. Ultimately, 36 documents were included in the manual analysis, while 139 were excluded, resulting in a total of 347 records incorporated into the review.;The first phase of this scoping review highlights that various countries worldwide have advanced in addressing the health needs of populations that utilize TCIM. These efforts include establishing regulatory frameworks, legislation, and national policies aimed at ensuring the quality, safety, and efficacy of TCIM health services. Additionally, they seek to uphold standards in the education and training of TCIM practitioners, as well as the quality and safety of phytotherapeutic, herbal, and homeopathic products. Strengthening technical capacities and regulating TCIM practices, products, and practitioners contribute to reducing out-of-pocket expenditures for patients and promoting access to quality-assured services.;"health systems; traditional medicine; complementary medicine; national policies"

Given the widespread reliance on TM in the region, the World Health Organization (WHO) Regional Office for Africa encouraged the scientific evaluation of these products to ensure their safety, efficacy, and quality. To assess progress, this study evaluated the conduct of clinical trials of traditional medicine for COVID-19 in six African countries: Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Ghana, Madagascar, Nigeria, South Africa and Uganda. The primary aim was to review and document: the strength and readiness of regulatory and ethical oversight; the conduct and outcomes of TM clinical trials for COVID-19; challenges and gaps in TM research, regulation, and practice; and make recommendations for strengthening TM evaluation and integration into health systems.";"
A multidisciplinary team conducted country assessments between 2021 and 2022. Data were collected through interviews with stakeholders including government officials, researchers, regulators, and traditional health practitioners; site visits to clinical trial centres, laboratories, and manufacturing units; and review of policies, trial protocols, and regulatory documentation. Data were analysed across six dimensions: political commitment, trial conduct, regulatory oversight, research infrastructure, manufacturing standards, and public engagement.";"The key findings in the assessment of clinical trials of herbal medicines for COVID-19 clinical trial were categorized according to the following parameters: Political commitment and government support, institutional support and collaboration, ethical and regulatory environment, manufacturing capacity, proposed herbal medicines for COVID-19, clinical trial capacity, pre-clinical studies, clinical studies, stage of product development, general state of TM practice. 
All six countries demonstrated strong political support for the inclusion of TM  in the COVID-19 response. Traditional medicine  clinical trials were in Phase II in all countries with South Africa conducting multicentre clinical trials in three sites. Regulatory systems varied widely; while national ethics committees were functional, few had TM-specific guidelines. Manufacturing standards were inconsistently applied, with few countries meeting Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) benchmarks. While research capacity was adequate, it was limited by inadequate funding, infrastructure, and coordination. Engagement between biomedical researchers and traditional practitioners was weak. Public communication strategies on traditional medicine safety and use were generally underdeveloped. Common challenges included fragmented regulatory and ethical oversight for traditional medicine clinical trials, insufficient national financing for traditional medicine research, limited laboratory infrastructure, and lack of harmonized protocols across countries. 
";"
While the political momentum for traditional medicine   evaluation was notable, this study identified significant systemic gaps in regulation, research governance, and quality assurance. To improve traditional medicine readiness for future public health emergencies, African countries must develop and harmonize national and regional regulatory frameworks for traditional medicine clinical trials, invest in traditional medicine research infrastructure and manufacturing capacity, build institutional capacities for regulators and ethical committees, foster collaboration between academia and traditional medicine practitioners, and launch public education campaigns for responsible traditional medicine  use.";"traditional medicine; Clinical trials; COVID-19; Regulatory and Health systems; Africa"

While approximately 10.6% of potential drug interactions lead to adverse events, current evidence often lacks direct clinical validation, particularly for HDIs. Our preliminary studies reveal significant knowledge gaps among healthcare providers regarding HDI risk assessment, with most relying on empirical experience rather than systematic evidence.
Existing HDI databases face limitations, including inconsistent evaluation criteria and variable human-AI concordance rates (18.9-20.5%). Clinical decision support systems for conventional drug interactions exist, but equivalent tools for HDIs remain underdeveloped due to heterogeneous evidence quality - ranging from in vitro studies to case reports - and lack of standardized assessment frameworks. This study addresses these gaps by systematically evaluating HDI assessment methodologies across clinical studies. Our cross-sectional analysis aims to characterize current approaches for proving interactions, assessing severity, determining causality, evaluating clinical relevance, and developing predictive models. The findings will inform the development of standardized HDI evaluation protocols to support clinical decision-making in integrative medicine practice.
";"This cross-sectional study comprehensively evaluates assessment methods for drug interactions (DIs) reported in clinical studies. We conducted an extensive literature search across seven major databases (CNKI, Wanfang, VIP, SinoMed, Web of Science, MEDLINE, EmBase, and Cochrane Library) from their inception through November 2024, with explicit exclusion of studies published only as abstracts without sufficient methodological details. Our analysis focused on clinical studies, including cross-sectional designs, case reports, case series, cohort studies, case-control studies, clinical trials, and systematic reviews that examined herb-drug, drug-drug, or food-drug interactions. The outcomes of DI evaluation approaches included five key domains: establishing interaction proof through direct evidence or indirect inference; standardised severity assessment methods; causality determination methods between DIs and adverse events; clinical relevance evaluation methods; and emerging machine learning prediction models. Descriptive statistical analysis was performed on study characteristics, pharmacological agents, DI assessment tools, and interaction outcomes, with stratification by study design to identify methodological patterns across different types of clinical evidence. This rigorous approach yielded a structured, evidence-based framework for DI assessment in both clinical practice and research settings. The screening process involved independent dual-reviewer evaluation of titles/abstracts followed by full-text assessment, with disagreements resolved through consensus discussion or third-reviewer arbitration, supported by NoteExpress software for reference management and duplicate removal.";Our systematic search initially identified 11,583 records, from which 3,665 duplicates were removed. Following title/abstract screening, 3,460 records were selected for full-text evaluation, ultimately yielding 1,405 included studies. Due to the substantial volume of included studies, data extraction is currently ongoing, with complete results to be presented at the conference. This extensive literature pool demonstrates both the clinical significance of drug interaction assessment and the methodological diversity in current research approaches.;This systematic methodological survey represents the first comprehensive effort to characterize and evaluate the diverse approaches used to assess drug interactions in clinical research. The conclusion will be announced at the conference.;"Assessment Methodologies; Severity Assessment; Clinical Relevance; Machine Learning Prediction; Decision Support Systems"

It involves the implementation of collective and individual strategies for integrative and community health care, with the “Journey of Care” as one of its main components, in which users undergo an interprofessional follow-up for 12 to 36 weeks. To support the sustainability analysis of this model, a cost-effectiveness model was developed using a real-world study approach. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the “Journey of Care” by analyzing the correlations between costs and clinical outcomes. ;Anonymized data were processed from clinical records, which include validated instruments for assessing clinical outcomes such as quality of life (PROMIS - Global Health), stress (PSS-14), anxiety (BAI), depression (BDI), and chronic pain (BPI). Questionnaires were applied at 12- to 16-week intervals. The cost analysis was conducted based on a bottom-up micro-costing methodology, considering (1) direct costs, which include professional hours and inputs related to clinical procedures, and (2) indirect costs, encompassing expenses such as rent, utility bills, physical structure, and administrative management. Cost-efficiency and cost-utility metrics will be applied, comparing the data obtained to national and international primary care benchmarks. ;The total number of users who completed cycles from June 2024 to May 2025 was 73. Among them, 61 presented analyzable clinical data (loss rate = 16.44%). The demographic profile of participants includes 95.08% women (n = 58), predominantly in the age range of 40 to 87 years (n = 55, 73.77%). Among the women, 40.98% (n = 25) live in a context of high social vulnerability, followed by 39.34% (n = 24) with low vulnerability and 19.67% (n = 12) with moderate vulnerability. The proportion of users who improved their Physical Health score (PROMIS) was 78.72% (n = 37/total = 47), and their Mental Health score (PROMIS) improved by 63.83% (n = 30/total = 47). Clinical improvements were also observed in mental health scores: PSS-14 improved by 84% (n = 21/total = 25), anxiety by 92.5% (n = 37/total = 40), and depression by 83.33% (n =15/total =18). Furthermore, 84.38% (n = 27/total = 32) presented improvement in chronic pain intensity. The average cost per user, per care path, was R$2.048,03 (direct costs) and R$3.478,17 (direct + indirect costs).; Preliminary results indicate the potential of the “Journey of Care” as a cost-effective strategy for integrative and community health care, considering direct costs, which highlights its potential for incorporation into existing health services. Nevertheless, definitive conclusions depend on appropriate statistical treatment of the data.;"Integrative Health; social impact; cost-effectiveness; real-world evidence; "

The Integrative Pediatrics evidence map includes systematic reviews and meta-analyses on the effectiveness of Traditional, Complementary, and Integrative Medicine (TCIM) on health outcomes in the pediatric population from newborn to adolescence.;All subjects, including gender, presence or absence of disease, and age range up to 21 years, were eligible for inclusion, as were all TCIM modalities, duration, and pediatric health outcomes. Studies that were not designed as systematic reviews or meta-analyses, did not focus on pediatric health outcomes, or did not have more than one primary article per outcome were excluded. At least two independent reviewers examined eligible studies. Initially, the title and abstract were analyzed using the Rayyan platform. Studies were selected according to the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Additionally, AMSTAR 2 was applied to analyze the quality and methodological rigor of the included studies and to classify the confidence level of the evidence as high, moderate, low, or critically low. The evidence map was organized considering the results, effects, and confidence levels of the included studies.;"The interventions found were from a wide variety of TCIM areas, including acupuncture, anthroposophic medicine, aromatherapy, Ayurveda, bioenergetics, homeopathy, meditation, osteopathy, medicinal plants, Chinese bodywork practices, nature-based interventions, multimodal approaches, supplements, cupping therapy, and yoga, based on 176 systematic reviews. Of 201 pairs of interventions with health outcomes, 145 had a positive or potentially positive effect (72%). Interventions with a positive or potentially positive effect were found for the following outcomes, in decreasing order: In the group of neuropsychiatric disorders (autism, epilepsy, cerebral palsy, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, anxiety disorders, and sleep-wake disorders), 25 intervention-outcome associations were found. For pain-related outcomes (with the exception of cancer), 18 different associations were found. For cancer pain alone, six additional associations were found, in addition to 10 associations between interventions and other oncological outcomes, such as chemotherapy-related nausea and vomiting, general cancer symptoms, and cancer-related fatigue.
For acute infections, including fever, respiratory infections, rhinosinusitis, hand-foot-and-mouth disease, and cough, 16 associations were found with these outcomes, and the same number were found for gastrointestinal disorders, including anorexia, appetite, bulimia, colic, binge eating, constipation, diarrhea, weight gain, irritable bowel syndrome, and gastrointestinal disorders. In the specific case of asthma, all studies demonstrated five positive associations between interventions.";The mapping of evidence in integrative pediatrics revealed a good proportion of studies with positive and potentially positive effects. Two-thirds of the associations between interventions and outcomes from these positive studies are concentrated in highly prevalent areas of pediatric care. The most prevalent area is mental health and neuropsychiatric disorders, the prevalence of which has only increased since the pandemic. Major clinical contributions were made to the following pediatric subspecialties: oncology, gastroenterology, otolaryngology, infectious diseases, and pulmonology.;"integrative pediatrics; Evidence Map; Systematic Review; Integrative Health; Child"

 Rationale for testing these fungi in children is supported by multiple lines of evidence: Ganoderma lucidum polysaccharides and triterpenes have documented immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects relevant to mucosal immune balance. Hericium erinaceus exhibits gastroprotective and mucosal-repair properties in preclinical models and has been shown to modulate inflammatory mediators and epithelial regeneration. Dietary fibers and ?-glucans from edible mushrooms produce prebiotic effects in vitro and in vivo, promoting short-chain fatty acid production and growth of beneficial taxa—mechanisms plausibly mediating symptom improvement. 1 Preclinical and some adult clinical reports also suggest symptomatic and microbiota-modulating benefits of these species, and small adult trials indicate acceptable safety profiles that support cautious pediatric exploration.
So mechanistic data from adults and preclinical models (immunomodulation, prebiotic action, mucosal protection) provide a biologically plausible rationale to test mycotherapy in pediatric FGIDs; results from this pilot support its safety and potential efficacy and justify definitive randomized, double-blind trials.
To evaluate the clinical effects of a pediatric nutraceutical formula containing Ganoderma lucidum and Hericium erinaceus extracts (Dr. GB, Hifas da Terra) and emulsified vitamin D in coconut oil (CocoVit D) on children with FGIDs.";" Given the need for safe, microbiota-targeted adjuncts in pediatrics, we conducted a quasi-experimental, open-label pilot study to evaluate a validated pediatric nutraceutical containing standardized extracts of Ganoderma lucidum and Hericium erinaceus (Dr. GB, Hifas da Terra) plus emulsified vitamin D (CocoVit D) over 12 weeks in 30 children (5–18 y) with FGIDs.
 Inclusion criteria were confirmed FGID, stable diet, and no antibiotics/probiotics in the prior 4 weeks;
 exclusions were organic GI disease, severe chronic illness, recent surgery, or immunosuppression.
 Participants received either a gluten-, casein- and soy-free diet plus vitamin D (control) or the same diet plus Dr. GB (0.5 mL/kg/day) and vitamin D (experimental).
 The sample size was limited for feasibility and hypothesis generation. Primary outcome was abdominal pain frequency/intensity; secondary outcomes included bowel habits, sleep latency, dermatologic symptoms, and relative abundance of key microbiota genera (Akkermansia, Bacteroides, Veillonella, Oxalobacter).

 Statistical analysis included normality testing (Shapiro–Wilk) and parametric or nonparametric comparisons as appropriate (SPSS v25, p<0.05).
 The study was  made under informed consent by the Parents.

";"The experimental group showed statistically significant improvements in:
•	Abdominal pain: reduced intensity and frequency
•	Sleep quality: reduced time to fall asleep
•	Dermatitis: decreased frequency and severity
•	Microbiota modulation: increased Akkermansia muciniphila, Veillonella spp., Bacteroides spp., and Oxalobacter spp.
•	Parasitic clearance: improved in the experimental group";"This pilot study supports the clinical potential of mycotherapy as a safe and effective adjunctive treatment for pediatric FGIDs. Improvements extend beyond gastrointestinal symptoms, impacting sleep and dermatological health, and suggest a regulatory effect on the intestinal microbiota.
 Further research is warranted to explore its impact on the gut-brain axis and overall well-being in children.

Most undergraduate health programs offer PICS-related content only as elective components and in limited scope. However, the state of Bahia stands out with a specific policy — the State Policy on Integrative and Complementary Practices (PEPIC-BA), established in 2019 — aimed at valuing regional cultural elements and fostering the development of human resources in PICS through initiatives in teaching, research, and community outreach. Bahia has made significant progress in promoting PICS through cooperation networks involving universities, health managers, and social movements. This study aimed to map the presence of PICS in the curricula of undergraduate health courses in Bahia, analyzing their inclusion across both public and private institutions.
";This descriptive and qualitative study examined 331 curricular matrices from a total of 413 identified health-related undergraduate programs, spanning 15 subfields.;"The programs with the highest number of PICS-related disciplines were Pharmacy (20), Biomedicine (16), Physical Education (11), and Nursing (10). Proportionally, Pharmacy (62.5%) and Biomedicine (47%) featured the greatest curricular inclusion, followed by Interdisciplinary Bachelor’s in Health (37%), Biology (31.3%), and Physical Education (29.7%). A comparison between institutional types revealed a higher prevalence of PICS-related disciplines in Biomedicine and Pharmacy programs within private institutions, while public institutions showed greater inclusion in Interdisciplinary Bachelor’s in Health, Speech Therapy, Biology, Physical Education, Pharmacy, and Medicine. Notably, 60% of the programs that include PICS content are offered by private institutions. The study categorized the disciplines into three thematic areas: (1) Specialty (ESP) – disciplines focused on particular PICS modalities; (2) Medical Rationalities and PICS (RM/PICS); and (3) Traditional Practices (PT) – including traditional medicine and spirituality in health. The first category was the most prevalent, with 65 disciplines (67%), mainly in Pharmacy, Biomedicine, Physical Education, Physiotherapy, and Nutrition, often reflecting practices more firmly institutionalized by professional councils. The second category appeared in 26 disciplines (27%), indicating a trend toward integrating broader theoretical discussions on PICS and medical rationalities into undergraduate education. Significantly, 70% of these courses are offered by public institutions. The third category, related to traditional and spiritual practices, was identified in six programs, all within public institutions.
Regarding curricular status, 53% of programs with PICS content included these disciplines as mandatory. However, mandatory inclusion is more frequent in private institutions (40%) than in public ones (11%). Overall, most PICS-related disciplines remain elective.
";This study contributes to the literature by identifying a substantial number of mandatory PICS courses in undergraduate health education in Bahia. It also reveals a tendency to focus on specific techniques rather than fostering a broader understanding of the principles of PICS, medical rationalities, and traditional healing systems. While curriculum analysis offers important insights, it is insufficient to fully capture the complexity of PICS education. A more comprehensive approach — including analysis of extension activities, research projects, and academic initiatives — is essential to better understand the integration of PICS into the training of future health professionals.;"Teaching; Integrative and complementary health practices; Undergraduate health"

These studies aimed to identify significant gaps in current HDI management and propose improvement strategies.;Five key components are proposed. First, we suggest that relevant parties establish a multidisciplinary consensus panel with expertise in herbal medicine, clinical pharmacology, and ethnopharmacology to establish HDI-specific evaluation criteria, addressing unique challenges like herb variability and traditional use patterns. Second, we recommend a dual-track review system incorporating both published literature and traditional medicine databases, with particular attention to pharmacokinetic herb-drug effects. Third, we propose to implement culturally sensitive feedback channels engaging traditional medicine practitioners, herbalists, and ethnomedicine experts alongside conventional healthcare providers, recognizing regional herb use variations. Fourth, we believe that quarterly evidence reviews are needed, prioritizing high-risk herb categories (e.g., anticoagulant herbs), with additional trigger-based updates when new herbal products enter consumer markets. Finally, we advocate to develop HDI-specific validation tools assessing both scientific evidence and traditional use data, including a grading system for interaction severity that accounts for herb preparation methods (e.g., decoctions vs. standardized extracts). Besides, evaluation methods that address clinical relevance of HDI evidence should be developed.;This proposed framework may standardize HDI evaluations, enhancing clinical decision-making. Future work should test its feasibility in real-world settings and compare outcomes against existing ad-hoc approaches.;"Herb-drug interactions; evidence evaluation framework; clinical decision-making; traditional medicine integration; pharmacovigilance"

Traditionally focused on neural pathways, recent innovations have extended these technologies to include stimulation of acupuncture points based on traditional Korean medicine. To clearly define this emerging intersection, we propose the term “acupuncture electroceuticals” to describe devices that combine electrical neuromodulation with acupuncture and meridian theory.;This term was initially introduced based on the concept of current electroceutical technologies and their application within acupuncture-based therapies. The development of this terminology also drew upon international standards, specifically International Standards Organization (ISO/TC 249 Traditional Chinese Medicine), to ensure technical and procedural consistency in the application of acupuncture-based devices. The term was proposed as part of our preparation for a formal ISO proposal item within ISO/TC 249, aiming to standardize this subclass of electroceutical acupuncture devices. Our work focuses on establishing safety and essential performance, guiding the classification of devices that integrate acupuncture therapy with electrical stimulation. Input was further gathered from an interdisciplinary panel of clinicians, biomedical engineers, and traditional medicine experts who are involved in developing ISO standards relevant to this terminology. This expert panel provided iterative feedback to ensure scientific validity and alignment with international standardization efforts. While formal consensus methodologies such as the Delphi method are planned for future research to ensure both scientific validity in defining this emerging subclass of electroceuticals, this initial expert consultation guided refinement of the terminology and classification framework.;Acupuncture electroceuticals represent a specialized subclass of electroceuticals that deliver electrical currents directly to acupuncture points. This approach synergistically integrates the mechanical stimulation inherent in acupuncture with modern bioelectronic modulation, offering new therapeutic avenues distinct from conventional peripheral nerve stimulation. By coining this term, we provide a conceptual framework that bridges traditional acupuncture practices and modern biomedical engineering, facilitating clearer scientific communication and clinical application. These devices include fixed clinical systems, portable patient-operated units, and wearable stimulator devices, of which each designed to target acupoints and meridians to modulate physiological responses and promote healing. For example, the Morning Band is a wrist-worn device that delivers electrical pulses for managing pregnancy-related nausea and vomiting. The e-coin, an implantable stimulator placed at the back of the ankle, is also used to treat overactive bladder. Both devices are approved by the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety and recognized as acupuncture electroceutical technologies by the Committee for New Health Technology Assessment in South Korea, enabling their inclusion in National Health Insurance billing claims within traditional Korean medical settings.;The introduction of “acupuncture electroceuticals” highlights the necessity for interdisciplinary collaboration among device developers, clinicians, and researchers to optimize therapeutic efficacy while respecting the complex physiological and theoretical foundations of acupuncture. This terminology also underscores the expanding potential of bioelectronic medicine, marking a significant step toward integrating ancient healing wisdom with cutting-edge technology.;"acupuncture; Biomedical device; Bioelectronic medicine; digital health; traditional medicine"

Despite its rising adoption, empirical evidence on patient perceptions and clinical outcomes remains limited in the Brazilian context. This study evaluated the experiences and outcomes reported by cancer patients after the implementation of Reiki therapy at the Centro de Práticas Integrativas Afecc/Hospital Santa Rita, in Espírito Santo, Brazil. The research was conducted with the purpose of observing the practice of Reiki therapy as complementary to cancer treatment, with an emphasis on its effects and patient perceptions. Furthermore, the study aims to contribute to the understanding of the possible outcomes of implementing complementary therapies.;A qualitative case study was conducted between 2019 and 2022 at Afecc/Hospital Santa Rita. A convenience sample of 75 adult cancer patients (age range: 26 to 75 years, predominantly women with breast cancer) participated in weekly 45-minute Reiki sessions. Data were gathered using structured clinical history forms, focusing on the patients' main complaints. Thematic cluster analysis was used to categorize the outcomes and experiences reported by patients. The study was part of the larger project “Study of Oncology Patients Treated at a Philanthropic Referral Service in Espírito Santo, Brazil,” proposed by the institution Afecc - Associação Feminina de Educação e Combate ao Câncer (Women’s Association for Education and Cancer Combat), with CEP number 6.508.181.;"Thematic analysis of patient reports identified three main categories of perceived benefits: (1) Control of physical symptoms — patients reported reduced pain and improved physical comfort; (2) Emotional well-being — participants described decreased depressive symptoms, reduced anxiety, and improved emotional stability; (3) Engagement in treatment — patients expressed increased motivation and adherence to conventional cancer treatment. Most participants reported subjective improvement to their initial complaints. The implementation of Reiki therapy also promoted greater awareness and acceptance of Integrative and Complementary Practices among patients and healthcare professionals in the institution.";This qualitative study suggests that Reiki therapy was well received by cancer patients and associated with self-reported improvements in physical symptoms, emotional well-being, and treatment adherence. Although these preliminary findings indicate potential benefits of integrating Reiki into cancer care, controlled studies with standardized outcome measures are needed to establish efficacy. The study contributes to the growing body of evidence supporting the integration of complementary therapies into comprehensive cancer treatment in Brazil.;"Reiki; Complementary Therapies; Neoplasms; qualitative research; Brazil"

It is part of the research project “Evaluation of health care in processes of integration between medical rationalities and therapeutic systems from different traditions” (CAAE 74618423.6.0000.5504). ;"Cross-sectional descriptive study. Period from August 2023 to May 2025. Data collected through informed consent. Sources: 1) patient records on admission to the service; 2) referrals from PHC; 3) electronic medical records. The anonymous data was standardized and tabulated for frequency analysis in the following. ";"150 people were seen and 617 consultations were carried out (TCM 49%, Anthroposophic Medicine 31%, Phytotherapy 20%). Ages ranged from 21 to 90 years (79% up to 59 years). Female 80%; LGBTQIA+ 19%; Single 43%; White 67%; Brown 23%; Black 7%; Indigenous 2%; 6% people with disabilities; Secondary education 41%; Incomplete primary education 13%; 35% with an income of less than 2 minimum wages. The predominant form of access was through public calls to specific populations (68%), such as people in social vulnerability and from rural communities; 23% were referred by municipal Primary Care (50% in 2025). More than one rationale was offered to 35% of patients. ";The ITAC is considered to have a diverse clientele, the majority of whom are female and on low incomes. The increase in referrals from primary care shows improved access for external clients. One third of patients had access to more than one rationale, demonstrating the interprofessional characteristics and the search for comprehensive care. It shows that the ITAC has potential for studies on the integration of medical rationalities in the clinic.;"medical rationalities; Integrative and Complementary Practices; Traditional Medicines"

However, clinical research in this field presents specific challenges—methodological, regulatory, and perceptual. Our aim was to present the experience of designing and conducting a randomized controlled trial (RCT) investigating lavender oil chest wraps as a complementary treatment for infants hospitalized with bronchiolitis, highlighting challenges and lessons learned to inform future TCIM research.;This ongoing multicenter RCT is being conducted in the pediatric departments of Geneva University Hospitals and Fribourg Cantonal Hospital. It evaluates the efficacy of lavender oil chest wraps in reducing cough frequency and improving secondary outcomes such as respiratory distress, crying, and sleep quality in infants under 12 months hospitalized with bronchiolitis. A parental questionnaire was added to assess the psychosocial impact of hospitalization and parental satisfaction. Recruitment began in December 2023 after a lengthy regulatory approval process. Challenges encountered were documented and analyzed thematically.;"Five key challenges were identified:
1.	Regulatory and Ethical Considerations: Although lavender oil was approved by the Swiss authority for therapeutic products, its application in chest wraps for hospitalized infants was considered novel and required over one year for authorization, delaying recruitment until after the seasonal bronchiolitis peak.
2.	Recruitment Dynamics: Recruitment varied across sites. In Fribourg, where chest wraps were already used in routine care, integration was smoother. In Geneva, unfamiliarity led to concerns about added workload. To support implementation and promote staff engagement, recruitment was initially limited to two patients per day. A decrease in bronchiolitis-related hospitalizations, likely associated with the introduction of nirsevimab in 2024, further impacted enrollment.
3.	Logistical and Methodological Considerations: Concerns about olfactory contamination in shared rooms, if infants were allocated to different arms, led to the development of preventive room assignment strategies, though such cases did not arise. Selecting the control group also required discussion—options included chest wraps without lavender or with a neutral scent. Ultimately, standard care without chest wraps was chosen as the control. Cough frequency was recorded using the CoughPro app, with calibrated microphone placement to avoid cross-interference from nearby patients or accompanying adults.
4.	Protocol Adaptation and Broader Impact: The inclusion of a parental questionnaire broadened the scope to include psychosocial aspects. A complementary qualitative study was launched to explore nurses’ experiences, including perceived impact, implementation barriers, and strategies for integrating TCIM interventions into routine clinical practice.
5.	Safety Monitoring: Differentiating between the expected clinical course of bronchiolitis and potential adverse effects of the intervention required continuous observation and case-by-case team review.
";This RCT demonstrates the feasibility and added value of TCIM trials in pediatric inpatient care. Key lessons include the importance of early staff engagement, regulatory anticipation, and logistical flexibility. Unequal recruitment across sites showed that strict numerical balance is not essential. The observed decline in hospitalizations suggests that future bronchiolitis studies should consider expanding inclusion criteria to children over one year of age. Incorporating parent and nurse perspectives enhances clinical relevance and supports the integration of TCIM in hospital settings.;"Bronchiolitis; integrative pediatrics; lavender oil; research challenges"

Symptoms appear early but may become clearer as social demands increase, causing significant life impairments. The family plays a key role, influencing emotional development and overall regulation. Family experiences affect many life areas, and beliefs and perceptions can even impact individual biology.
Research on family dynamics in ASD remains limited. No studies have examined the effects of Family Constellation on parents’ perceptions of children with ASD. This study aimed to assess whether a Family Constellation intervention focused on parents could lead to perceived improvements in their children and in family dynamics.";Ten families with children diagnosed with ASD participated in the “From Absence to Presence” project (SC, Brazil) in partnership with AMA. Interventions focused on parents (children were indirectly affected) and occurred between Dec 21, 2019, and May 31, 2020, partly online due to COVID-19. Questionnaires with nine Likert-scale items were administered immediately after, six months, and five years later, assessing Family Constellation’s impact on children’s development, family interactions, and parents’ recommendations. Responses were justified and analyzed using descriptive statistics and Cochran’s Q test (SPSS v27).;"Analysis showed a significant effect only for Q5 (family dynamics, p = 0.01): “strongly agree” responses dropped after six months but stayed positive. Other questions showed no statistical difference, though positive trends remained. The highest “strongly agree” rates were right after the intervention, decreased at six months, and rose slightly after five years, with no negative or undecided answers.
Open-ended responses highlighted improvements in children’s eye contact, autonomy, communication, sleep, and emotional relationships. Parents reported greater emotional balance, benefiting family harmony. These results suggest that interventions focused on parents can indirectly impact children over time.
The findings align with Lipton’s epigenetic theory, which links beliefs and environment to gene expression, and with Hellinger’s systemic principles, supporting Family Constellation as a method to transform family dynamics and consciousness.";Family Constellation may improve family dynamics and behavior in children with ASD. This pilot study has limitations, including a small sample and lack of validated measures. Further research using standardized tools is needed to assess behavioral and family changes after Family Constellation interventions.;"Autism; Family Constellation; adult education"

Growing evidence suggests that both externally applied bioelectric signals and altered states of consciousness (such as meditation or intention) can influence gene expression through epigenetic mechanisms, opening new frontiers for personalized and integrative therapies. This systematic review synthesizes recent research on (1) bioelectric and electromagnetic interventions, (2) consciousness states, and (3) their impact on epigenetic modulation and cellular signaling.

";A systematic review was conducted in PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and arXiv, covering publications from 2018 to 2025. Keywords: “bioelectric modulation,” “electroceutics,” “epigenetic plasticity,” “consciousness,” “gene expression,” and “neuromodulation.” Inclusion criteria: peer-reviewed original research or systematic reviews addressing relationships between bioelectric/electromagnetic interventions, epigenetic changes, and/or consciousness-related outcomes. Exclusion: non-indexed sources, case reports, or theoretical-only articles. Study quality was assessed using PRISMA and GRADE. Data were extracted on intervention type, epigenetic endpoints, outcomes on consciousness or neural plasticity, and mechanistic insights.;"Forty-one studies met inclusion criteria. Multiple lines of evidence demonstrate that controlled electrical and electromagnetic stimulation—including direct current, low-frequency EM fields, and advanced bioelectric interfaces—can modulate gene expression via epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation, histone modification, and chromatin remodeling. For example, Pinton et al. (2018) showed that low-frequency EM fields altered histone methylation (H3K27me3) and promoted anti-inflammatory gene expression in immune cells. Cadinu et al. (2025) and Hora de Carvalho (2025) describe next-generation bioelectrical interfaces and AI-driven approaches capable of reorganizing gene networks and cell fate, with implications for regenerative medicine, cancer, and aging.

In parallel, recent studies such as Fredriksson (2025) and Chopra et al. (2025) provide evidence that states of consciousness—including meditation, intention, and mind-body practices—are associated with beneficial epigenetic changes, including the downregulation of pro-inflammatory genes and alterations in DNA methylation. Fredriksson (2025) reported changes in DNA methylation and histone acetylation associated with emotional and conscious states, while Chopra et al. (2025) reviewed how mind-body interventions modulate neuro-immune-endocrine axes through epigenetic pathways. Integrative frameworks propose potential synergy: bioelectric interventions may be enhanced by mental state (e.g., intention, focused attention), while consciousness-based practices could sensitize neural circuits to electroceutical modulation. However, most studies remain exploratory, with small sample sizes, heterogeneous protocols, and limited direct evidence linking subjective states, bioelectric signaling, and epigenetic outcomes in humans.";"This review highlights a converging frontier where bioelectrical modulation and consciousness-based interventions both impact epigenetic plasticity and neural signaling. Electroceutical approaches reliably modulate gene expression via measurable epigenetic pathways, while states of consciousness exert more subtle but increasingly documented effects (Fredriksson, 2025; Chopra et al., 2025). Combined, these approaches may enable individualized therapies targeting genomic and neuroplastic health. Rigorous experimental and translational research is needed to clarify mechanisms and realize clinical potential. Integrative bioelectroceutics and consciousness science represent promising directions for personalized medicine.";"Bioelectric Modulation; Epigenetics; Electroceutics; Consciousness; Genomic Plasticity; "

This study aims to raise awareness about the importance of implementing Integrative and Complementary Therapies in the corporate environment as a tool for mental health care. It also seeks to analyze their contribution to compliance with NR-1 regarding the identification and management of psychosocial risks. This is an experience report conducted in a foreign trade company with 16 employees. Over the course of one year, techniques were applied biweekly, such as aromatherapy — using environmental diffusers focused on improving concentration and reducing anxiety — and practices from Traditional Chinese Medicine (MTC), including auriculotherapy and adapted shiatsu. Each session lasted approximately 20 minutes per employee.";"Over a 12-month period, 20 integrative health interventions were carried out in the workplace, involving 16 participants, with the aim of promoting mental well-being. The interventions included aromatherapy techniques (using diffusers to improve focus and reduce anxiety) and practices from Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), such as auriculotherapy and adapted shiatsu. Sessions were held biweekly, lasting 20 minutes per employee.
To assess the effects, participants completed a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) from 0 to 10 before and after each session, evaluating levels of anxiety, stress, and pain — with 0 indicating the complete absence of symptoms and 10 representing the maximum perceived intensity. At the end of the 12-month period, statistical analysis of the collected data was conducted using averages and the Student’s t-test to evaluate the significance and impact of the techniques applied in managing stress and anxiety.";"The results showed that the practices were well received by both employees and management, promoting significant improvements as evidenced by the Student’s t-test, which yielded a result of 0.00253 when comparing the average levels of anxiety and stress at the beginning and end of the intervention period.
A questionnaire was also applied to assess whether the proposed sessions were aligned with the mental health care and well-being objectives. As a result, 100% of the managers reported satisfaction with the team's outcomes, highlighting increased employee engagement, a reduction in complaints, and employees requesting the continuation of the integrative therapy program.
When asked about the choice of techniques and their relevance to the mental health care guidelines proposed by NR-1, all 16 participants agreed that auriculotherapy, chair-adapted shiatsu, and inhalation-based aromatherapy provided satisfactory benefits, even in stressful situations inside or outside the corporate environment.";It is concluded that Integrative Therapies can be effective strategies for promoting mental health in the workplace and are aligned with the preventive guidelines of NR-1, especially within the scope of the Risk Management Program.;"mental health; Integrative Therapies; Occupational Stress"

Digestodoron®, a traditional herbal preparation, is used to treat the disorders. This study aimed to explore the anti-inflammatory properties and mechanisms of Digestodoron® and its individual components (Dryopteris filix-mas [Df], Phyllitis scolopendrium [Ps], Polypodium vulgare [Pv], and Salix alba/purpurea/viminalis [Sm]) on intestinal motility.;Dry extracts from ethanolic tinctures were tested on GPCRs associated with gastrointestinal disorders (M3, delta- and mu-opioid, and 5-HT4 receptors) in CHO-K1 cells. Ex vivo tests on guinea-pig colonic muscle strips evaluated the relaxing effects of Digestodoron® and Pv extracts (0.5, 1, and/or 5 mg/mL) following Carbachol-induced contraction. The production of pro-inflammatory leukotrienes and prostaglandins, along with NF-?B pathway activation, were analyzed as markers of inflammation. NF-?B activation was assessed using a reporter assay in the human Jurkat cell line, while the inhibition of pro-inflammatory and pain-related enzymes 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) was evaluated using recombinant human enzymes.;Digestodoron® and Pv extracts inhibited M3 receptor activity (IC50: 492 and 79 ?g/mL, respectively), while opioid and 5-HT4 receptors were unaffected. The Pv extract (5 mg/mL) induced 76% relaxation of Cch-induced muscle strips contraction after 30 minutes of incubation. Addition of the Digestodoron® extract at 1 and 5 mg/mL produced 60% and 70% relaxation, respectively. However, after 30 minutes, significant relaxation of 45% was induced only by the 5 mg/mL concentration. Digestodoron® extract and the Ps and Sm extracts strongly suppressed 5-LO enzyme activity (IC50: 12.6, 60.6, 16.6 ?g/mL, respectively), whereas Pv and Df showed a lower inhibition effect (IC50: 223.8 and 648.6 ?g/mL, respectively). On the other hand, COX-2 enzyme activity was suppressed by Digestodoron® extract and all single extracts (IC50: 12.6 (mixture), 25.5 (Df), 14.3 (Ps), 7.9 (Pv), 2.7 (Sm) ?g/mL). Additionally, NF-?B activation was inhibited by Digestodoron® and Sm extracts (IC50: 223.1 and 79.6 ?g/mL).;These findings suggest that the anti-cholinergic properties of Polypodium vulgare contribute to Digestodoron®'s efficacy. Its ability to relax colonic muscle strips and reduce inflammation highlights its potential as a therapeutic agent for gastrointestinal motility disorders and IBD.;"Digestodoron; inflammatory bowel diseases; Cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway; Polypodium vulgare"
