";"At the time of consultation, she was breastfeeding and taking haloperidol 2mg/ml (20 drops at night) and sertraline 200 mg/day. The antipsychotic had been switched from risperidone to haloperidol during pregnancy due to contraindications related to pregnancy and breastfeeding. Despite the medication, she continued to experience the following persistent symptoms: persecutory thoughts, visual and auditory hallucinations, suicidal ideation, mood swings, and affective blunting. She complained of intense drowsiness and also observed drowsiness in her daughter after breastfeeding. She felt unable to carry out her daily activities.
";The patient has a diagnosis of depression with psychotic symptoms, made by psychiatrist, for over five years.;" An individualized homeopathic treatment was proposed with the goal of relieving psychiatric symptoms and enabling a reduction in conventional medications. Hyosciamus niger 5LM was prescribed twice daily, with a follow-up appointment scheduled for 30 days.
";"At follow-up, the patient reported significant improvement, with a marked reduction in the frequency of psychotic symptoms. On her own initiative, she reduced haloperidol to 10 drops and reported less drowsiness and no suicidal ideation. She experienced mild episodes at the beginning of homeopathic treatment, which were managed using the ""plus"" method, as instructed. She resumed social activities. Based on this progress, a gradual withdrawal plan for haloperidol was developed and successfully implemented.
 The patient was monitored over a period of one and a half years, with bimonthly consultations. She remained off haloperidol, and the sertraline dose was reduced to 150 mg/day. During periods when she stopped using the homeopathic remedy, there was a recurrence of symptoms, which subsided once she resumed regular use.
";"This case highlights the potential of homeopathy in the complementary management of refractory mental symptoms, even in patients taking high doses of conventional antidepressants and antipsychotics. Its main advantage is the absence of side effects typically caused by conventional medications, allowing its use even in situations such as pregnancy and breastfeeding. As a case report, it presents a number needed to treat (NNT) of one, demonstrating high clinical effectiveness. The main limitation was the lack of validated tools for quantifying symptoms before and after the intervention.¹ ²
 
This case shows that homeopathy can be a valuable complementary therapeutic resource, promoting symptom control, reducing adverse effects of psychotropic drugs, and improving quality of life.
";"""I have depression, and during crises I experience hallucinations. I am being treated with allopathic medication along with homeopathy and I’m seeing excellent results. We were even able to replace the antipsychotic with homeopathy. I’m very happy with the outcome.""

This case highlights a previously healthy 35-year-old woman with severe neurocognitive dysfunction and fatigue following COVID-19, who made a remarkable recovery using integrative therapies, including diet modifications, phytonutrients, and neuromodulation techniques. Her case contributes to the understanding of potential therapeutic options for Long COVID, particularly in addressing complex neurocognitive and autonomic dysfunctions.;A 35-year-old ICU nurse with no significant past medical history contracted COVID-19 in January 2023. She experienced initial symptoms of headache, fever, fatigue, and prolonged sleep (18 hours daily).

Vibrant antibody testing: 19 brain auto-antibodies present, confirming diagnosis of post-viral autoimmune encephalomyelitis.";Treatment included the use of CGRP antagonists for migraine relief, supplements (iron, riboflavin, vitamins D and C, zinc, perilla, quercetin), and neuromodulation with TransVagal Nerve Stimulation (TVNS). She followed a lectin-free, anti-inflammatory diet. After three stellate ganglionic nerve blocks, she experienced complete symptom resolution. Botox and LDN (low-dose naltrexone) were used to manage migraine severity and systemic inflammation, leading to significant improvement in fatigue, brain fog, and neurocognitive deficits. One year later, the patient achieved 95% recovery and returned to full-time work. Follow-up tests showed improved inflammatory markers (CRP, TGLB antibodies).;The second SBG was not effective and caused phrenic nerve paralysis.;"This case underscores the effectiveness of a multi-faceted, integrative approach to managing severe Long COVID, highlighting the role of neuromodulation, dietary changes, and targeted supplements in reversing debilitating post-viral symptoms. The patient’s near-total recovery supports the potential for similar therapeutic interventions in Long COVID patients, though personalized treatment remains key. TVNS and Ganglionic nerve blocks, particularly when administered by experienced providers, may offer a valuable intervention for dysautonomia.
Key Takeaways:
•	Post-COVID neuro-encephalomyelitis and dysautonomia are serious complications of Long COVID that can be effectively managed with a combination of conventional and integrative treatments.
•	Integrative approaches, including diet, nutraceuticals, and neuromodulation, can significantly improve outcomes in severe cases of Long COVID.
•	Ganglionic nerve blocks show promise as a therapy for reversing dysautonomia, though outcomes can vary depending on provider expertise";I couldn't walk or speak when I met Dr. Kuon.

This highlights the pressing need for a more holistic and comprehensive strategy. Traditional Ayurveda treatment integrated with Yoga and physiotherapy shows promising benefits in ischemic/ haemorrhagic stroke management in sub-acute to chronic stages. The integrative approach accelerates recovery and improves quality of life in patients with ischemic and haemorrhagic shock. ;We describe a 62-year-old male patient with bilateral Gangliocapsular and Thalamic infarcts, with a 3-month history, treated conservatively. He is a known case of Type 2 Diabetes and Systemic Hypertension. The initial assessment of the patient revealed a Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of 3, indicating moderate disability, and a Barthel Index score of 60, reflecting a need for assistance in daily living activities. The Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) was recorded as grade 3 in the left upper and lower limbs, indicating considerable spasticity.;The patient suffered a stroke in November 2023. In February, he was admitted to our hospital. We planned seven days of Pottali massage, 8 days of Sirodhara, and 8 days of Pizhichil.;Diagnosis was confirmed by CT brain revealing bilateral Gangliocapsular and Thalamic infarcts. Ayurvedic assessment was done with Daavidhapareeksha. ;After the patient reached a post-recovery plateau, an integrative treatment approach was planned, combining traditional Ayurvedic therapies, Yoga, and physiotherapy. We structured this holistic regimen in phases over twenty-four days. The therapeutic strategy aimed to enhance neurological recovery, functional independence, and overall well-being. Clinical assessment tools, including the Modified Rankin Scale (mRS), Modified Barthel Index (MBI), and Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS), were employed to monitor and evaluate the patient's progress throughout the treatment and follow-up period.;At baseline, the patient had a Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of 3 and a Barthel Index (BI) score of 60, indicating moderate disability and partial dependence for daily activities. The Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS) was recorded as grade 3 in the left upper and lower limbs, indicating considerable spasticity. Following the integrative treatment, the MAS score improved to grade 2, reflecting an improvement in muscle tone. The patient also demonstrated notable improvements in cognitive function and showed independence in daily activities.  The patient's gains were consistent during follow-up assessments conducted at one, two, and six months post-treatment. No serious adverse effects were observed during or after the intervention.;"An integrative approach, including Ayurvedic treatment, yoga, and physiotherapy, helps relieve myofascial release, relieve flexion synergy, and strengthen the muscles. The sustained improvements in motor function, muscle tone and overall functional independence suggest that such a multidisciplinary strategy can offer meaningful recovery beyond conventional care. Further research is warranted to confirm these findings, which can contribute to the development of standardised integrative protocols for stroke rehabilitation.

Pain limited her endurance capacity for walking, sitting for prolonged periods, and climbing steps. At the initial Ayurveda consultation, the patient reported severe pain throughout the past week. The pain intensity was rated as nine to ten while walking, and seven to eight while at rest on a numeric pain scale from zero to ten. The patient reported that the pain intensity increased during the early morning, in cold weather, when walking, and when sitting for long periods. Laying down reduced the pain intensity. The patient had no history of trauma, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, allergies, hypertension, or diabetes. She reported using nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) as painkillers during episodes of severe pain (one 500 mg tablet of ibuprofen).

An Oswestry Disability Index score of 55% at the initial Ayurveda consultation indicated severe disability. The Ayurvedic examination revealed severe pain, stiffness, rigidity in the lower back, irregular appetite, and constipation, which indicated Vata imbalance. The Ayurvedic diagnosis was Kati Shoola.";The patient received eight weeks of Ayurvedic treatment.;The above symptoms clearly indicate Vata aggravation. The vitiated Vata dosha has likely become localized in the Kati pradesha (lower back), resulting in Katishoola (low back pain). The patient’s lifestyle further confirms this imbalance of Vata. These cumulative influences support the pathogenesis of Vata prakopa and its localization, ultimately manifesting as Katishoola.;Holistic Ayurvedic treatment principles include local oil application and sudation therapy with a specific herbal oil, internal administration of herbs, dietary and lifestyle modifications, and yoga to help reduce pain and improve mobility.  Patient received an Ayurvedic therapy called Katibasti once a week for eight weeks. In addition, the patient was instructed to take two pills of Kaishora Guggulu (450 mg) and two pills of Yogaraja Guggulu (450 mg) twice a day with hot water after breakfast and dinner. Dashamoola decoction with eranda Taila twice a day was also given for eight weeks.;The patient’s low back pain almost completely resolved over the course of eight weeks with holistic Ayurvedic treatment protocols. At the end of the fourth week of treatment the patient rated their pain at five out of ten while walking, and at two to three out of ten while resting.

Studies show 25% - 45% of middle-aged or older women experience UI annually, with 15% reporting daily leakage. This case explores acupuncture and Transcutaneous Electric Nerve Stimulation (TENS) as therapeutic interventions for UI. It also examines parallels between Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) acupoints and the anatomical targets of Percutaneous Tibial Nerve Stimulation (PTNS), a modern urologic treatment derived from acupuncture. ;A 66-year-old female with hypertension, pre-diabetes, stress UI, and chronic low back pain presented to the UCLA Center for East West Medicine with worsening stress UI after menopause. She had two vaginal births and tried pelvic floor exercises without improvement.;"Patient received weekly to biweekly acupuncture, then monthly maintenance after improvement.

Milestones:
9/25/24 - First acupuncture
10/9/24 – 3-4 days of UI improvement
10/30/24 – Longer relief; started TENS
12/18/24 – TENS twice daily; one UI episode in between visits
6/25/25 – No leakage with coughing/sneezing; continued TENS ";The patient never saw a urologist for formal evaluation, but her symptoms were consistent with stress UI with leakage several times a day from coughing, sneezing, and exercise. Retrospective ICIQ-UI SF score before treatment was 9. TCM assessment revealed a pale tongue with cracks and teeth marks, consistent with Kidney-Yin and Qi deficiency. ;Physician-administered acupuncture included LI4/LV3/ST36/KD3/SP6/SP9/SP10/SI3/UB62 points with needles retained 20 minutes/session. Patient instructed to use home TENS unit over SP6/KD3/SP9. ;The patient noted symptom improvement after one session, with longer-lasting relief over time. UI episodes decreased from multiple times daily to once weekly, with no leakage during coughing, sneezing, or exercise. Post-treatment ICIQ-UI SF score improved to 3. TENS adherence was high with no adverse events reported.;"This case highlights the use of TCM-based acupuncture in treating UI, showing symptom improvement through neuromodulation. Several acupoints used align with the course of the posterior tibial nerve, the same target used in PTNS, a minimally invasive treatment involving electric needle stimulation near the ankle and foot. Though acupuncture has long been used for UI, contemporary studies of PTNS have shown that stimulating the posterior tibial nerve modulates sacral nerve pathways (S2-S4), which play a key role in bladder function. In this case, both in-clinic acupuncture and home TENS unit were used to stimulate similar anatomical regions, resulting in substantial improvement in UI symptoms.

PTNS is a third-line therapy per U.S urologic guidelines, typically reserved for refractory cases. However, this case raises the question of whether acupuncture and TENS could be introduced earlier in the treatment guidelines, which may reduce the need for pharmacologic or invasive interventions, improve patient outcomes, and broaden access to care. However, this is a single case, and larger studies are needed to evaluate these findings.";“I've had stress incontinence for about 40 years…EVERY time I sneezed, coughed, or did stress exercises…I leaked…After my first acupuncture session…the leaking stopped! I was AMAZED at how well it worked!...I sneezed, coughed, and nothing!...I feel I have found an incredible solution in acupuncture and the TENS unit treatment.”;Yes;"Urinary Incontinence; acupuncture; Percutaneous Tibial Nerve Stimulation; Traditional Chinese Medicine; Neuromodulation"

It has no defined etiology and may have more than one causative factor. Physiotherapy seeks to provide a better quality of life through resources such as laser, which can be associated with auriculotherapy as laser puncture, and radiofrequency, promoting analgesia and muscle relaxation.;Women with a clinical diagnosis of FM, over 18 years of age, who presented preserved thermal sensitivity in the bilateral upper trapezius region, who were able to travel to the research site and agreed to sign the Free and Informed Consent Form (FICF) participated in the study.;The participants were divided into two groups, called G1 (application of radiofrequency in the upper trapezius) and G2 (application of radiofrequency in the upper trapezius associated with auricular laser puncture), following the order of confirmation of participation after the physiotherapy evaluation was completed. In the first session, the volunteers were evaluated, and between the 2nd and 9th sessions, the therapeutic application was performed weekly. In the last session, the reevaluation was performed, totaling 10 meetings.;"During the evaluation, identification and anamnesis data were collected, as well as physical examination of tender points that were painful upon palpation and thermal sensitivity testing in the upper trapezius region, bilaterally. Pain indices were also assessed using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS).
The degree of functionality was assessed using the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ).
Anxiety and depression levels were measured using the Beck inventories (BDI and BAI).";"The treatment of group G1 consisted of radiofrequency application with a tetrapolar handle in a temperature range between 35ºC and 37ºC. The application time was 5 minutes in an area of ??100cm2.
For the treatment of group G2, radiofrequency was applied, associated with low-intensity laser at a wavelength of 660nm with a dose of 4 Joules, continuous mode, at an incidence angle of 90º, for a time defined by the equipment, which was 8s in the auricular points.";Eight female subjects diagnosed with FM participated in the study and were divided into two groups: G1 (n=4) and G2 (n=4). The sample consisted of women aged between 28 and 61 years. Among the comorbidities present, in addition to FM, the following stood out: depression (n=5), rheumatic diseases (n=5), heart problems (n=3), thyroid disorders (n=3), anxiety (n=2), dyslipidemia (n=2) and lupus (n=1).;The interventions performed with radiofrequency and laserpuncture demonstrated positive results in the levels of pain, anxiety and depression, although no statistically significant improvement was obtained in these variables. The reduction in the total values ??obtained in the FIQ questionnaire in G1 is noteworthy, which represents an improvement in the functionality of these individuals. Although G2 received a combination of radiofrequency and laserpuncture, no statistical difference was evidenced in the parameters evaluated.;Through weekly monitoring of the volunteers, it was possible to perceive that emotional factors generate a negative impact on the manifestation of physical symptoms of FM, aggravating functional limitations and compromising their autonomy.;Free and Informed Consent Form (FICF).;"Auriculotherapy; Fibromyalgia; Physical Therapy; Laser; Radiofrequency Therapy"

The syndrome can affect the nerves that control muscle movement as well as those that transmit pain, temperature and touch sensations. This can result in muscle weakness, loss of sensation in the limbs, numbness or paralysis and problems swallowing or breathing. Weakness and tingling in the hands and feet are usually the first symptoms. These sensations can quickly spread and may lead to paralysis. Guillain-Barre syndrome is rare, and the exact cause is not known. Two-thirds of people have symptoms of an infection in the six weeks before Guillain-Barre symptoms begin which includes respiratory or a gastrointestinal infection, including COVID-19. Guillain-Barre also can be caused by the Zika virus. There's no known cure for Guillain-Barre syndrome. Several treatment options can ease symptoms and help speed recovery. Most people recover from Guillain-Barre syndrome, but some serious illnesses can be fatal. In Ayurveda, this condition considered as Sarvangavatam.

ISAA score was reduced to 115 from 127.;According to Ayurveda, disorders such as ASD are believed to result from the improper functioning of mental faculties. Ayurveda views the mind and body as an integrated unit. The imbalance of Tridoshas—Vata, Pitta, and Kapha in the body, and Sattva, Rajas, and Tamas in the mind—is considered the root cause of various diseases. In this case, the treatment protocol aimed to restore balance in these doshas, with particular focus on improving gut health, enhancing cognitive function, and regulating behavioral symptoms. Ayurvedic therapies were integrated with supportive interventions like Occupational Therapy (OT) and Speech Therapy to form a holistic and individualized treatment plan. The ISSA assessment score results are as follows: Social Relationship and Reciprocity-reduced to 31(AT) from 34(BT), Emotional Responsiveness-reduced to 18(AT) from 19(BT), Speech-Language and Communication-reduced to 22(AT) from 24(BT), Behaviour Patterns-reduced to 26(AT) from 28(BT), Sensory Aspects-reduced to 10(AT) from 12(BT) and Cognitive Component-reduced to 8(AT) from 10(BT)..This integrative approach contributed to notable improvements in both behavioral symptoms and functional abilities, as well as in ISAA scores.  It underscores the value of Ayurvedic insights into disease pathogenesis and individualized treatment planning.

Lack of sleep is associated with significantly decreased work performance, impaired daytime function, and increased health care costs. Insomnia is the most prevalent sleep disorder wherein the patient experiences difficulty initiating and maintaining sleep, along with non -refreshing sleep. It adversely affects a person's professional life, physical and mental health as well as overall quality of life.  Constant stress can be a factor. The most serious impact of insomnia is increased risk of depression. Mindfulness, as an important component of yoga, improves sleep disturbance by increasing melatonin levels, reducing hyperarousal, and addressing stress related cardiac and respiratory abnormalities. Although there have been research studies in the past exploring the effect of yoga on psychophysiological disorders, there is a dearth of research involving integrated therapy approach.;A 58-year-old female, self-employed, presented with musculoskeletal pain and insomnia at Vaidyaratnam nursing home. This case study was undertaken to explore the add on effect of yoga in anxiety disorders and insomnia.;The patient was assessed on day 1 and after completion of 14 days therapy for Sleep Quality and Quality of life by using standard questionnaires. The patient underwent yoga and Ayurveda treatment for 14 days at Vaidyaratnam Nursing Home, Thaikkattussery.;The case was taken as insomnia with the support of insomnia screening questionnaire.

A Case Report;Auriculotherapy using Nogier frequencies was applied as a complementary intervention in a 56-year-old woman treated for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the posterior lateral border of the tongue. This case is unique in demonstrating functional recovery from radiotherapy-induced sequelae—xerostomia, dysgeusia, dysphagia, and trismus—through auricular stimulation targeting specific cranial nerve reflex points.;The patient underwent surgical resection of the tumor, left cervical lymph node dissection, and submandibular gland removal. Postoperatively, she developed xerostomia, altered taste, nausea, and reduced swallowing capacity. After 66 days, she began 30 sessions of intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). Symptoms worsened progressively with radiotherapy, particularly xerostomia and dysgeusia. She had no relevant genetic history or comorbidities. The tongue’s posterior mobility was significantly reduced.;-A timeline of intervention began 37 days after radiotherapy ended. Four auriculotherapy sessions were performed, spaced according to symptom recurrence. At each session, electrical detection identified reactive points on the ear corresponding to cranial nerves V, VII, IX, X, and XII. After auricular preparation using Frequencies D and L, therapeutic Frequencies A (2.28 Hz), B (5.56 Hz), and C (9.12 Hz) were applied to each responsive point for 5 seconds each.;"Diagnosis:  Tongue (biopsy of lateral border);    Squamous cell carcinoma";The first session resulted in resolution of nausea, return of appetite, and recovery of acidic and bitter taste. Xerostomia improved enough to reduce the use of artificial saliva. By the second session, gag reflex had returned, dysgeusia improved, and dysphagia slightly decreased. After the third session, the patient noted facial relaxation, and for the first time, cranial nerve V was responsive. Trismus symptoms lessened. By the fourth session, nearly all taste modalities were restored, and swallowing improved.;This case illustrates how auriculotherapy with Nogier frequencies may offer effective support in oncologic rehabilitation. Sustained symptom relief and improved oral function suggest neural modulation via auricular pathways. Results support integrating auriculotherapy as a non-invasive adjunct to manage radiotherapy sequelae in head and neck cancer.;This case reinforces auriculotherapy as a promising complementary approach for addressing post-radiotherapy complications in head and neck cancer. By stimulating specific auricular zones corresponding to cranial nerves involved in oral functions, improvements were observed in taste, saliva production, swallowing, and facial tension. The use of Nogier frequencies may have contributed to cellular repair and neuromodulation. While the effects cannot be solely attributed to auriculotherapy, the observed improvements highlight its therapeutic potential.;"""I thought I’d never eat normally again.

Few studies have examined its effects on heart rate variability (HRV), a key marker of autonomic nervous system (ANS) and psychological health. Evidences from 2014 to 2024 suggests TJQ may improve HRV and reduce depressive symptoms. This case report assessed TJQ’s impact on HRV and quality of life in a Brazilian adult after a four-week intervention.;39-year-old Brazilian Caucasian cisgender woman with prior TJQ experience. BMI: 27.61 kg/m². She reported no tobacco or alcohol use and had a medical diagnosis of anxiety (CID F41.1) and depression (CID F33) under pharmacological and psychiatric management since 2014.;Baseline data were collected on 03/27/24, and final assessments were completed on 04/20/24 in a four-week supervised TJQ program. ;Before and after intervention, the WHOQOL-BREF applied, blood pressure (analogic sphygmomanometer), body composition (bioimpedance scale), and abdominal circumference (tape measure) measured. HRV data were recorded using a Polar H10 chest strap paired with the Elite HRV app during all 8 sessions and analyzed using Kubios HRV software. ;"The intervention consisted of two times per week 85-minuteTJQ sessions: 5' initial relaxation, 15' preparatory exercises (Fang Song and Ba Duan Jin), 30' correct technique instruction, and 30' practice Yang-style forms (8; 16), and 5'post-session. She maintained her usual routine. ";"After four weeks of TJQ practice, the participant showed improvements in physiological, psychological, and anthropometric measures. Resting HR decreased from 85 to 80 bpm, and blood pressure shifted from 136/78 to 128/90 mmHg. Body weight slightly dropped (63.8 to 63.0 kg), fat mass reduced (41.2 to 36.9 kg), and lean mass increased (25.2 to 28.0 kg). Abdominal circumference decreased from 90 to 88.5 cm. HRV analysis indicated better ANS regulation: mean HR (94 to 86 bpm), RMSSD rose (12.9 to 49.2 ms), SNS index declined (3.92 to 0.81), and stress index dropped (21.9 to 7.3), rise in HF (236.82 to 1254.6 ms²) that suggested heightened parasympathetic activation during TJQ practice. WHOQOL-BREF psychological scores improved (63 to 69), while physical and social domains stayed stable; environment scores decreased (56 to 50). No adverse events were reported.";"This case report highlights the specific improvements of ANS regulation, psychological well-being, and body composition in a 39-year-old woman with depression. After four weeks of supervised practice, HRV analysis indicated increased parasympathetic activity, reduced sympathetic tone, and lower stress levels. Psychological health improved, while physical health and social relationship scores remained stable; a slight decline in the environmental score may not be intervention-related. Reductions in anthropometry suggest positive changes in body composition. These findings align with existing research on TJQ’s benefits for ANS balance and emotional regulation. Further studies are needed to confirm these effects and define clinical protocols.

While physical therapy is considered the as gold standard, additional therapeutic options are needed since physical therapy is not always successful and for those who cannot tolerate the physical exercises.;This case report describes a chronic mid-portion Achilles tendinopathy in the right leg of an 80-year-old Caucasian male patient. The patient had a 2.5 cm leg length discrepancy caused by a tibial fracture at age 31.;At the initial consultation, the patient reported recurring right Achilles tendon pain for over 12 months. This persisted despite an orthopaedic footwear adjustment 8 months prior. The treatment and follow-up described in this report took place over the following 2.5 years.;Pain was rated at 5-6/10 on the visual analogue scale, which significantly limited his leisure time and daily activities. Initial assessment was an external clinical assessment. Clinical evaluations during therapy showed minimal tenderness at the distal Achilles tendon insertion, with no swelling or redness.;An orthopaedic footwear adjustment had been made 8 months prior to consultation. Initial medical treatment had included symptomatic analgesia, which the patient was not utilizing at the time of consultation. An integrative injection therapy with Tendo/Allium cepa was initiated, administered subcutaneously three times per week. Concurrently, the patient performed regular physiotherapy exercises and applied a daily local ointment (comfrey anti-inflammatory, Stannum met praep 0.4%), though the ointment provided no additional benefits. A temporary switch to Symphytum comp yielded equivalent results to the Tendo/Allium cepa injections.;Over 2.5 years, the injection therapy demonstrated good therapeutic efficacy, with symptoms consistently resolving after 2-3 weeks of treatment. Symptom-free intervals with injection therapy alone averaged several weeks. Regular physiotherapy exercises extended these symptom-free intervals but could not maintain symptom relief on their own. Withdrawal trials confirmed a usage-effect correlation without requiring adjustments to the injection dose or frequency. The injection therapy was tolerated with no adverse effects.;This case report describes the efficacy of Tendo/Allium cepa comp in treating chronic mid-portion Achilles tendinopathy. It also suggests additional benefits in extending symptom-free intervals when combined with physiotherapy exercises. The positive outcome confirms the therapeutic potential of the injection therapy. Further clinical studies are needed to evaluate the broader therapeutic effects and optimal application methods (subcutaneous vs. oral) of Tendo/Allium cepa comp in chronic mid-portion Achilles tendinopathy.;The patient remains satisfied, experiencing no limitations in leisure time or daily activities.;Informed consent was obtained from the patient.;"Achilles Tendinopathy; Tendo/Allium cepa comp; Anthroposophical Medicine; Injection Therapy; case report"

However, differences in heart rate variability (HRV)—which reflects the balance between the sympathetic (SNS) and parasympathetic (PNS) nervous systems—between experienced and beginner practitioners remain underexplored???. This study assessed autonomic effects of TJQ across experience levels, focusing on parasympathetic adaptations from sustained practice.
";"Participant A: 39-year-old man; 1.67 m; 70 kg;  26 years of TJQ.
Participant B: 25-year-old woman; 1.56 m; 50 kg; beginner with 6 months intermittent practice of TJQ.";In April 2025, HRV data were collected from both participants, with recordings taken 5 minutes before and after each individual's 75-minute Yang-style session.;HRV data were recorded using a Polar H10 chest strap synchronized with the Elite HRV app.  Analysis was performed with Kubios software, assessing autonomic balance via RMSSD (Root Mean Square of Successive Differences), SDNN (Standard Deviation of NN intervals), NN50 (Number of successive NN intervals that differ by more than 50 ms), and pNN50 (Percentage of NN50) parameters, where NN is the normal intervals between heartbeats.;The TJQ class followed a structured sequence: 5 minutes of joint mobilization, 15 minutes of Ba Duan Jin (focused on controlled breathing), 30 minutes of Yang-style techniques, and 25 minutes practicing the 8- and 16-form sequences.;The experienced practitioner showed high PNS modulation post-session, with RMSSD 45.6 ms (a time-domain HRV index reflecting vagally mediated parasympathetic control), positive PNS index (0.14), and negative SNS index (-0.42), indicating parasympathetic dominance linked to physiological and emotional well-being. In contrast, the beginner showed lower PNS activity (RMSSD 40.7 ms, PNS -1.11, SNS 1.44), indicating sympathetic dominance and reduced autonomic flexibility. The SNS index reflects sympathetic load. Thus, long-term practice appears necessary for greater autonomic improvements.;"This case report suggests that TJQ practice improves autonomic control—especially in experienced practitioners—by enhancing PNS modulation and balancing SNS activity, supporting the idea that regular exercise lowers SNS activity and increases vagal tone over time?. As reduced vagal function is linked to higher morbidity and mortality?, interventions that enhance autonomic balance are important. Combined with prior evidence that regular TJQ increases HRV and parasympathetic activity, this report reinforces that long-term practice drives the adaptations needed for maximal autonomic benefit.
";"A:  “The TJQ class is deeply meaningful to me as both teacher and practitioner. Since starting in 1999, I’ve focused on being fully present and attentive, especially while teaching. During data collection, I taught and practiced with participants, focusing on relaxation and Yang-style sequences, ending satisfied and grateful for contributing to everyone’s self-cultivation”. 

B: “I noticed reduced tension, improved body awareness, balance, and concentration after the TJQ session. Though modest, these changes feel meaningful.”

This creates a critical need for complementary approaches that address disease progression while managing quality of life. We present a case using protocol of complementary medicine jointed conventional care in a high-risk patient.;"A 64-year-old male smoker with psoriatic arthritis and Crohn’s disease (39-year history, maintained on Golimumab) diagnosed with stage IV ccRCC (PET-CT confirmed 8th rib metastasis). Following radical nephrectomy, metastasectomy and palliative radiotherapy, systemic therapy was deferred by the oncologic committee due to autoimmune flare risks (ASCO contraindication criterio). 
Life expectancy: 6-12 months.

The patient sought integrative care, expressing existential distress: ""I want to live better—not only physically, but emotionally and mentally."" Comprehensive evaluation revealed:
- Chronic stress and melancholic temperament
- Emotionally repressive childhood with financial instability
- Unprocessed trauma from business failure and divorce
- Profound sense of ""unlived life"" exacerbated by diagnosis.";"September 2023 diagnosis of ccRCC stage IV.

The program included:
- Flower remedy Arliberum (15 drops every 12 hours)
- Custom floral formula (10 drops every 6 hours)
- Mind-Body Therapy sessions every 2-weeks
- Nutritional counseling anti-inflammatory diet and lifestyle support

The intervention aimed at liberating emotional conflict through structured routines, therapeutic goals, and patient empowerment.";"By April 2025 (16 month-follow-up) PET-CT showed no evidence of active oncologic lesions. The patient continued biological therapy with stable autoimmune disease, inflammatory markers continued normal, and described:
- Increased motivation to quit smoking
- Improved emotional expression and self-worth
- Renewed capacity for solitude and introspection
- Strengthened relationships with family

No adverse effects were reported, adherence to integrative therapy remains high.";"This case presents three key observations:
- Clinical stability was maintained despite ICI contraindication.
- Psychoneuroimmunological mechanisms may explain outcomes, as chronic stress reduction can modulate immune function.
- Existential distress resolution appeared to significantly impact quality of life.

This case illustrates the potential role of integrative oncology in patients with advanced ccRCC who cannot receive ICIs. Complementary approaches may promote not only quality of life but also clinical stabilization.

Limitations
Short-term follow-up, natural history variability and absence of controlled data limit generalizability.";"He stated in April 2025: “Today I see an entertaining future. Before, it was a place of little hope, and low self-esteem too.”

This report aims to describe the clinical course of an elderly patient with metastatic breast cancer who, exercising her decision-making autonomy, chose to use the Archeus medication exclusively as therapy. Additionally, it reflects on the ethical implications of this choice, focusing on the adherence to the bioethical principles of justice, beneficence, and non-maleficence, which are fundamental to patient-centered care and the preservation of quality of life.
";"84-year-old widowed patient, accompanied by her two daughters, with a tumor in the right breast, pain, swelling in the arm, fatigue, and depression.

";"BioFAO Medicine proposes that bioregulation of the biofield, through homeopathic medicines, stimulates the immune system's innate healing capacity, even in serious conditions such as cancer. (Amorim, 2018) Although there are basic studies in animals and other chronic conditions, rigorous clinical research is still lacking to validate its oncological use. The exclusive use of Archeus raises ethical issues related to non-maleficence, beneficence, justice, and the need for transparent informed consent regarding its unproven effectiveness.

Neuroscience and neuroimaging techniques describe the perceptual phenomenon, mapping its processes in the human body regarding evolutionary neurological marks learning and memory. In this context, we present a case report of a child with limbic encephalitis secondary to group B streptococcus infection with refractory mesial temporal lobe epilepsy, who was treated with neurosurgery intervention and anthroposophic therapies.;A six-year-old female who presented fever and cough, receiving antibiotic therapy (amoxicillin-sulbactam). A week later, she manifested drowsiness and loss of consciousness, having a febrile convulsion, culminating in a status epilepticus that led her to remain four months in an intensive care unit, with assisted ventilation and monitoring.; After discharge, she had multiple daily seizures (around fifty per day), refractory to the association of the antiepileptic drugs (AED). The seizures and the side-effects of the drugs did not allow her to have a normal life, needing a constantly nursing care. ;Previously to the anthroposophic approach, the exam of the CSF detected an increased number of lymphocytes, and proteins, which is seen in encephalitis. The FDG-PET/CT image after the surgery revealed right temporal hypometabolism due to surgery resection, and CT showed moderated frontal and parietal edema possibly related to pos-surgical edema. Post-surgically, the MRI showed reactional gliosis in the right temporal region, with mesial unilateral sclerosis. The EEG findings highlighted the high intensity spikes and electrical brain rhythm disorganization. ;"Five years later, she started the following multimodal anthroposophic therapies: Pressel massage, craniosacral therapy, anthroposophic external therapies, biographic work with pedagogical medicine, medical care focused on “neuro anthroposophic” approach in all sessions, and the following .edicines (injectable/oral):helloborus D6 (oral and injectable), and the injectables: cuprum aceticum D4, zincum valeriana D6, bryophyllum argentum cultum D5 calycinum D5, calcarean carbonica D6, rhus D4 + hypericum D5 + bryonia D5, chelidonium D5 + cardum D5 and viscum P (Iscador).

This pattern was changed after eight months of treatment with the anthroposophic therapies. Two years after the beginning of the anthroposophic approach, the seizures frequency decreased expressively (mean = 5 seizures/day), being the patient free of seizures for until 60 days. The treatment made possible her return to school and reestablishment of her other life activities.

";The multimodal therapies with the medicines applied contributed to harmonize the role of brain measurement of the organ superficial tension, simultaneously reducing this tension (acting directly controlling the seizures) and strengthening the regenerative processes and circadian rhythms (reducing the nocturnal seizures). The protection and shield of the vitality and strengthening of the immunological defense minimized the symptoms of encephalitis, gliosis, and hippocampal sclerosis.;Before the anthrophosophic therapies, the patient presented a condition of several disabling.

In addition to herbal therapy, a comprehensive sleep support plan was implemented, including stress management techniques (yoga nidra, meditation), circadian rhythm regulation, cooling strategies for night sweats, acupuncture, and digital tools such as CBT-I and sleep apps. Magnesium glycinate was also recommended to support sleep and counteract potential gastrointestinal side effects from Verzenio.;After implementing recommendations including SZRT use, the patient reported improved sleep quality, fewer nighttime awakenings, and feeling more rested. After a few months, her hot flashes had significantly decreased, and she was able to discontinue SZRT while maintaining restful sleep. Six months later, she remained on letrozole and abemaciclib with no recurrence of insomnia. Her most recent scans (March 2025) showed no evidence of disease (NED).;This case demonstrates the potential of TCM herbal therapy, specifically SZRT, to address endocrine therapy-related insomnia in breast cancer patients. The integrative approach—combining evidence-based herbal support with lifestyle and mind-body interventions—was well tolerated and contributed to improved quality of life and treatment adherence. SZRT may be a safe and effective adjunct for managing sleep disturbances in patients undergoing endocrine therapy for breast cancer.

2014: New unresectable lung nodule. Due to chemotherapy-induced toxicity (Grade 3) and lack of caregiver support, she declined further systemic therapy and opted for integrative care in March 2014.

Patient Perspective and Psychosocial Evaluation
Patient was referred to Unit for Integrative Medicine in public hospital, expressing existential distress: ""I want to die well. The psychiatric team says I am depressed, but I am not; I am just realistic."" 

Key psychosocial findings included:
- Strong familial cancer history (four first-degree relatives)
- Childhood marked by feeling rejected by father and physical punishment.
- Unresolved grief from partner abandonment. 
- Profound sense of being rejected combined with resentment.
- Ostomy-related shame and social isolation.";"2014 start of integrative care.

1. Prolonged Survival: The patient exceeded expected survival by nearly a decade, despite metastatic progression.
2. Psychoneuroimmunological Mechanisms: Perceived stress reduction may have modulated inflammation and immune function, potentially influencing disease control [Chen et al 2022].
3. Existential Healing: Therapeutically addressing ""dying well"" shifted her focus to living well, improving QoL.

Conclusion
This report challenges the inevitability of rapid decline in mCRC, suggesting that integrative care —particularly psychosocial and existential support liberating the inner conflict —may enhance survival and well-being. Rigorous clinical trials are needed to validate these findings.

- Single-case design prevents generalization.
- Possible indolent tumor biology cannot be excluded.

Symptoms include difficulty falling asleep, sleeping through the night, or early morning awakenings, associated with impaired daytime performance that must persist for more than four to twelve weeks. First-line treatment is cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), with short-term use of sedatives, hypnotics, or antidepressants if CBT is insufficient. However, sedatives carry a dependency risk, and there are no clear guidelines for complementary medicine due to insufficient data. According to the hyperarousal model, inadequate downregulation of the stress system can lead to persistent overexcitation. This case series explores the use of an Anthroposophic Medicine (AM) remedy, Bryophyllum Argento cultum, for chronic insomnia with coexisting factors for hyperarousal.;"Three patients with chronic insomnia and one or more factors for hyperarousal were included.
•	Case 1: 11-year history of chronic insomnia and a history of trauma; 10mg zolpidem sporadically.
•	Case 2: lifelong insomnia linked to childhood war experiences; 10 mg zolpidem regularly
•	Case 3: PTSD, high sensitivity and new-onset insomnia with daytime restlessness; lorazepam on demand.";All three patients were treated over several months and followed up up to 4 years.;The diagnosis was chronic insomnia, characterized by difficulty falling asleep and sleeping through the night or early morning awakenings, leading to impaired daytime performance. Patients also presented with one or more additional factors for hyperarousal.;"All three patients received Bryophyllum Argento cultum 2x or 3x, administered at a dose of 15 drops, one to three times daily. 
•	Case 1: Received Bryophyllum Argento cultum 3x.
•	Case 2: Started Bryophyllum Argento cultum 3x, which allowed for the tapering of zolpidem.
•	Case 3: Initiated Bryophyllum Argento cultum 2x and continued it as on-demand support (5–10 drops, 1–3 times/day).
The remedy does not have any dependency or interaction potential with other medications.";"In all cases, a significant improvement in night sleep was observed within a few days of starting treatment, including fewer nocturnal awakenings, an easier return to sleep, and enhanced daytime well-being.
•	Case 1: Showed marked and sustained improvement, discontinuing treatment after ten months with the effect lasting over four years.
•	Case 2: Discontinued daily zolpidem within four months, only requiring it as an occasional low-dose medication during the one-year follow-up.
•	Case 3: Symptoms and the need for lorazepam resolved within one week of starting treatment. The therapy was continued as on-demand support over a three-year follow-up.";In Anthroposophic Medicine, Bryophyllum Argento cultum 2x and 3x has been used for decades to improve the autonomic nervous system's ability to relax, for example, after shock-like experiences.

Despite its proven efficacy, ET is frequently associated with adverse effects, particularly musculoskeletal symptoms (MSS), such as arthralgia and myalgia, which can significantly impair quality of life and lead to reduced adherence or premature discontinuation of therapy. The effectiveness of available pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions is often limited. Anthroposophic Medicine (AM) has been proposed as a potential integrative strategy to support patient well-being during cancer treatment.;Three pre- or postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer were included. All were undergoing ET and experiencing significant MS that was refractory to conventional management respective physical activity.;Clinical data were collected over a minimum follow-up period of three years through regular patient consultations.;The severity of musculoskeletal pain was evaluated using patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) and the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS).;This case series investigated the therapeutic potential of the anthroposophic medicine remedy Arnica/Levisticum 6x comp for ET-induced MSS. To assess the reproducibility and durability of the therapeutic effect, treatment interruption and resuming trials were conducted for each patient.;All three patients reported marked and rapid improvement of their symptoms after starting Arnica/Levisticum 6x comp. Symptom relief was typically achieved within 2–3 weeks, with a mean reduction of 2–4 points on the VAS. During periods of medication interruption, symptoms recurred, and they consistently resolved upon resuming the medication. The medication was well tolerated over the entire observation period of at least three years, with no adverse effects reported.;This case series provides preliminary evidence supporting the efficacy and safety of Arnica/Levisticum 6x comp as a complementary treatment for ET-induced MSS in breast cancer patients. The consistent symptom relief, excellent tolerability, and long-term safety suggest this AM medication may be a valuable adjunct to conventional supportive care. By improving quality of life and promoting adherence to ET, it could contribute to better long-term outcomes. A larger controlled study would be needed to further confirm these findings.;Patients experienced significant improvements in daily functioning and overall quality of life, which additionally enabled them to adhere to ET.;All patients provided informed consent for participation in and publication of the case series.;"Breast cancer; endocrine therapy; musculoskeletal symptoms; Anthroposophic Medicine; Arnica/Levisticum 6x comp"

Although the Joel Aleixo System flower essences have been used for approximately 30 years, there is no scientific literature documenting case reports, clinical experiences, or studies involving patients with panic syndrome and anxiety treated with this type of flower therapy. This flower essence system, recognized by Brazil's Unified Health System, is distinguished by the way in which the components of 99 Brazilian flowers are extracted, enriching the flower essences with trace elements, capable of acting on the mental and emotional realms, transforming sensations and feelings, as we will see in this case study.";"The patient, a 24-year-old Brazilian female, obese, and a veterinary physician, began experiencing palpitations, anxiety, and a sensation and fear of imminent death. She was diagnosed by a psychiatrist with panic disorder, which began during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2021, and started interfering with her professional activities.

She had been taking Escitalopram 10 mg for six months and sublingual Clonazepam during crises, which occurred two to three times per week. In the alchemical therapeutic anamnesis, numerous difficulties were identified in relation to her mother during the gestational period, and later throughout childhood and adolescence, when she was primarily raised and cared for by her paternal grandparents and her mother. Insecure and without prospects, she worked in a position below her qualification, doing exhausting night shifts, subject to the available work in the city.

";In 2021, she began treatment for anxiety and panic disorder with a psychiatrist for six months, complementing it with flower remedies from the Joel Aleixo system, in two 50-day phases. In the first phase, she noticed improvement in symptoms, with a reduction in attacks, and began taking sublingual clonazepam once every two weeks. In the second phase, her doctor reduced and then discontinued the medication.;"
The diagnosis was generalized anxiety and panic attacks.";The selection of flower essences in the Joel Aleixo system is more complex than in other floral systems. There are protocol formulas for cleansing feminine energy, which represent the first phase, lasting 50 days and using essences of anthurium, bromeliad, tibouchina, geranium, lantana, pansy, plumbago, and marigold. The second phase, also lasting 50 days, uses essences of aloe vera, geranium, sunflower, azalea, bracatinga, mandacaru, amaryllis, geranium, and hibiscus.;"There were no side effects from the flower essences; the patient used the formulas correctly. There was a progressive and significant reduction in symptoms, to the point that after 100 days, the doctor discontinued the anxiolytic.

Despite his infidelities, her mother insisted she marry him. Feeling extremely suffocated, she broke off the engagement, fell into depression, began losing weight, expressed a desire to die, and experienced intense guilt. Her hemorrhoidal bleeding worsened, even after several surgeries;In October 2010, the patient presented with depression, anxiety, and panic attacks, treated with sertraline and clonazepam.

Evidence suggests Traditional, Complementary, and Integrative Medicine (TCIM), including Ayurveda, may offer holistic preventive and therapeutic benefits. However, more clinical data are needed to support its integration into mainstream public health strategies. This case series documents the impact of an Ayurvedic polyherbal formulation, Panchkola churna, on cardiovascular risk reduction in individuals identified to be at risk for CVD in terms of gene expression study, signifying the preventive potential of Ayurveda. ;"This case series evaluates four individuals (two males, two females, aged 30–36 years) with sedentary occupational profiles identified as at risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Participants were asymptomatic but classified as at-risk based on abnormal lipid profiles, family history of CVD (myocardial infarction, stroke, or peripheral vascular occlusive disease), history of tobacco smoking, or documented hypertension. Three participants had no significant past medical or interventional history. One male had mild hypertension, currently untreated. All reported a family history of CVD; no genetic diseases were noted. Physical examinations were unremarkable except for one participant with mild hypertension (elevated systolic blood pressure). No relevant prior interventions were reported.";The participants were evaluated and administered the interventional drug between 21st and 23rd August, 2024, with intermittent assessments on 5th and 7th September, 2024. Final assessments were made on 20th and 22nd September, 2024;All participants exhibited abnormal lipid profiles with low-risk FRS (<10% 10-year CVD risk), along with a score ?10 in an Ayurveda-validated tool (RAS-RCVD) assessing Rasa Dhatu Dushti (impaired tissue metabolism linked to CVD risk), confirming  Physical examination, lipid profiles, FRS (<10% 10-year CVD risk), and RAS-RCVD scale (?10, indicating Rasa Dhatu Dushti) confirmed elevated CVD risk. ;Each participant received Panchakola Churna, a polyherbal Ayurvedic formulation, at a dosage of 2 g twice daily (BD), one hour before meals, with lukewarm water, for a duration of 30 days.;"Outcomes were assessed at 30±3 days, including lipid profile, APOE/IL-6 expression, FRS, RAS-RCVD scores. Compliance was monitored; no concurrent interventions and adverse events were reported. Post-intervention, lipid profiles were improved: total cholesterol and triglycerides were lowered, HDL was raised, and LDL was reduced or stabilized. Total cholesterol/HDL and LDL/HDL ratios were enhanced. RAS-RCVD scores were lowered in most, and FRS was reduced in all. APOE and IL-6 expression was suppressed.";Panchakola Churna, comprising Piper longum (Pippali, Pippalimoola), Piper retrofractum (Chavya), Plumbago zeylanica (Chitraka), and Zingiber officinale (Nagara), likely exerts cardiovascular benefits through bioactive compounds. Piperine from P. longum and P. retrofractum enhances lipid metabolism, reducing cholesterol and triglycerides while increasing HDL in animal models. Z. officinale’s gingerols exhibit anti-inflammatory effects, potentially suppressing IL-6 expression. P. zeylanica’s plumbagin shows antioxidant properties, mitigating oxidative stress. These mechanisms, supported by Ayurvedic principles, suggest cardiovascular risk reduction, necessitating further clinical validation.;The participants reported improved energy levels with the intervention, apart from improved lipid levels.; All the participants provided written informed consent.;"Cardiovascular disease; APOE; IL-6; lipid profile; gene expression"

Developed through collaborative dialogue between professionals and patients, the STP considers clinical, psychological, social, and cultural aspects. In complex chronic pain cases, such as knee osteoarthritis (KOA), the STP strengthens therapeutic relationships and enhances treatment adherence.

KOA first-line treatment emphasizes non-pharmacological strategies like education, exercise, and weight management. Thus, integrative therapies represent cost-effective options to manage KOA and improve quality of life.

This case report describes how implementing an STP helped manage chronic pain in a patient with KOA at an outpatient clinic offering complementary and integrative therapies (CIT).
";"A 58-year-old man visited the clinic on January 8, 2025, reporting chronic pain from KOA.  A night watchman, his job requires walking, which had become increasingly difficult due to bilateral knee and left foot pain. He rated his pain as 5/10 on the Visual Analog Scale and used NSAIDs periodically.

He had become more sedentary but still handled basic errands. Mental health screening (PHQ-9, GAD-7) showed no signs of depression or anxiety. His wife, concerned about his reduced mobility, encouraged him to seek care. His medical history included obesity and hypertension; he was taking losartan, hydrochlorothiazide, and simvastatin. Previous physical therapy and auriculotherapy yielded limited results.

Due to the case's complexity, a Singular Therapeutic Project was initiated with full patient engagement. His BMI was 49.3 (148 kg, 1.75 m), so orlistat was prescribed and dietary advice provided. A genogram, social network map, and ecomap identified limited physical activity and difficulty losing weight as vulnerabilities. Strengths included strong family support, motivation to reduce pain, and job flexibility. Goals were set to reduce pain, restore function, and regain autonomy. He committed to using a stationary bike at work and reducing caloric intake.

She presented chronic widespread pain (fibromyalgia), moderate to severe depression, severe anxiety, assessed by standardized inventories.  She had a history of poor adherence, possible cognitive decline, and difficulty managing her medication. ;Entry into the Care Journey occurred in September 2024, with the administration: PROMIS and the Family Vulnerability Scale. The first clinical cycle (12 weeks) started in November, followed by a second cycle from March to June 2025. At the end of each cycle, additional assessments included the PSS, BAI, BDI, and an Integrative Pharmacy Questionnaire (self-developed).;The patient presented with chronic pain and emotional imbalance. Integrative evaluations revealed deep energetic blocks and systemic disharmony. Ayurveda indicated aggravation of Vata (fibromyalgia, insomnia, dry skin), Pitta (hypertension, irritability), and Kapha (diabetes, obesity). TCM identified Kidney Yin and Yang deficiency, Spleen Qi and Blood deficiency, Liver Qi stagnation, Damp-Phlegm accumulation, and Cold-Wind obstruction. Treatment focused on promoting Qi and Blood flow, warming and tonifying Kidney and Heart, reducing Dampness and Phlegm. Warm diet, body therapies, and breathing practices supported vitality, emotional balance, and reduced inflammation.;Interventions were delivered by a multidisciplinary team. The case manager provided individual sessions and coordinated 12 Mental Health Group meetings. The integrative practices professional applied auriculotherapy, meditation, cupping, aromatherapy, integrative art, herbal medicines, and therapeutic massage across nine sessions. The integrative pharmacist led six sessions to promote treatment adherence and rational use of medicinal plants.;Questionnaires showed significant improvement in Mental Health by 31.25% and Physical Health by 41.17%. The BAI score dropped by 44.44%, and the BDI shifted from moderate/severe depression to absence of depression. Metformin was reduced, and sertraline discontinued, reflecting a significant decrease in medication burden.;"This case highlights the benefits of a person-centered approach employing integrative practices alongside rational pharmacotherapy. The personalized strategy implemented by Farol facilitated a significant reversal of the clinical condition and promoted tangible improvements in health and quality of life.
Conclusion
The case of O.C. da S. exemplifies how an individual-centered approach and integrative care can lead to significant positive clinical and psychosocial outcomes, even in complex cases. Improvements in both physical and mental health conditions contribute to broader social and community well-being. This is supported by the patient’s testimony expressing a desire to re-engage in affectionate relationships and participate more actively in her community.

Although conventional treatments aim to pharmacologically stabilize the heart rhythm, emotional dysregulation, insomnia, and anxiety often remain unsolved. This case report describes the integrative and complementary therapeutic process of a 41-year-old patient with severe ventricular arrhythmia, using the Joel Aleixo Floral System combined with conventional cardiological treatment.;A 41-year-old Brazilian male mail carrier presented with dizziness, pre-syncope, and fatigue lasting two months. He was diagnosed with severe ventricular arrhythmia and began treatment with amiodarone while awaiting an electrophysiological study. He also suffered from chronic insomnia, anxiety, night sweats, nightmares, and long-term constipation. He would wake up in a panic, with palpitations and overwhelming emotional exhaustion. To complement conventional treatment and avoid invasive interventions, he began a complementary protocol with the Joel Aleixo flower therapy system.;Month 0: Diagnosis confirmed by 24-hour Holter. Antiarrhythmic therapy with amiodarone initiated. Month 1–3: Start of flower therapy. Emotional symptoms improved, though intense dreams persisted. Month 4–6: Marked clinical improvement—normalization of sleep, cessation of nightmares and arrhythmia symptoms, increased emotional stability. Month 6+: Amiodarone was safely discontinued under cardiological supervision. Holter repeated—no recurrence of arrhythmias.;Diagnosis of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia on 24-hour holter, in addition to anxiety, dizziness, presyncope, panic and nocturnal agitation.;There are protocol formulas, representing the first phase, lasting 60 days, using essences of anthurium, bromeliad, tibouchina, geranium, lantana, pansy, plumbago, and calendula. The second phase, also lasting 60 days, uses essences of aloe vera, geranium, sunflower, azalea, bracatinga, mandacaru, amaryllis, geranium, and hibiscus.;Significant improvements were observed: reduced anxiety, normalized sleep, cessation of nightmares and symptoms of arrhythmia. The cardiologist suspended the amiodarone and, at the patient's request, repeated the Holter monitoring after 15 days to completely eliminate the antiarrhythmic requirements. The patient remained asymptomatic and returned to normal daily activities, including work, with restored emotional resilience. He repeated the 24-hour Holter monitoring, which no longer showed any arrhythmias. He continues to be monitored by a cardiologist and, after 3 years, there was no need to resume the use of antiarrhythmics.;This case highlights the potential role of Joel Aleixo's floral remedies in treating the emotional and energetic roots of cardiovascular dysfunction. By integrating vibrational medicine with conventional treatment, the patient achieved emotional regulation and physical stabilization without additional pharmacological dependence. Although case reports do not allow for generalizations, the observed results suggest that energetic therapies can aid neurocardiac homeostasis. This reinforces the importance of integrating Traditional and Complementary Medicine (TCM) into multidisciplinary care. Present in Brazil for over 30 years and recognized by the Unified Health System (SUS) as an integrative practice since 2018, these essences still lack sufficient scientific validation.;After I started using flower remedies, I began sleeping through the night. Before, I would wake up panicked, sweating, and feeling like my heart was going to explode. Now, I sleep peacefully, feel calmer, and no longer experience dizziness or arrhythmias, although I continue to have routine checkups with my cardiologist.;Yes. it can be presented.;"Arrhythmia; Anxiety; insomnia; Alchemical Flower complementaryTherapy; "

This case report presents the complementary use of Joel Aleixo’s alchemical flower essences in a patient with chronic autoimmune dermatitis. It highlights the role of the therapy in improving physical symptoms and emotional wellbeing, including the restoration of self-esteem and renewed family engagement.;C.P., a 37-year-old, Brazilian, dentist, was diagnosed with autoimmune dermatitis during childhood. Throughout her life, she had consulted over 100 physicians with limited results. At the time of the initial integrative evaluation, she presented with painful open skin lesions under her fingernails caused by glove talc, diffuse white patches on her legs and body exacerbated by sun exposure, pruritus in the nipple area (associated with fungal infection), and generalized skin vulnerability to bacterial and fungal agents. She reported persistent pain during work due to discomfort and skin fragility, affecting her self-esteem and motivation.;"Childhood to adulthood: Chronic dermatitis; multiple medical consultations with no remission.  Months 0–2: Integrative consultation; Phase 1 of floral therapy initiated, along with topical creams (cleansing and protection, joy, and wellbeing). Rapid reduction in skin pain and itching; visible skin healing began. Months 3–4: Phase 2 of floral therapy initiated. Continued dermatological improvement and significant emotional and social progress.";The diagnosis of autoimmune dermatitis was confirmed through dermatological history and clinical observation. Secondary fungal infections and cutaneous hypersensitivity were confirmed by biopsy, scraping, and fungal culture. Energetic assessment included analysis of chakra and elemental imbalances.;The selection of flower essences in the Joel Aleixo system is more complex than in other floral systems. There are protocol formulas for cleansing feminine energy, representing the first phase, lasting 50 days, using essences of anthurium, bromeliad, tibouchina, geranium, lantana, pansy, plumbago, and calendula. The second phase, also lasting 50 days, uses essences of aloe vera, geranium, sunflower, azalea, bracatinga, mandacaru, amaryllis, geranium, and hibiscus.;Significant clinical improvements were observed, including 100% resolution of pruritus, 100% healing of open lesions on the hands, and 80% improvement in hypopigmented patches on the legs within the first two weeks of treatment. Self-esteem improved. The patient returned to work pain-free and resumed outdoor activities and sun exposure without adverse effects. Photographic documentation before and after treatment confirmed substantial dermatological recovery and increased vitality.;Although recognized by SUS since 2018, Joel Aleixo's floral therapy lacks robust scientific studies. This case suggests benefits for immunity, skin, and emotional balance. It is essential to expand research to validate its effectiveness and fully integrate this practice into conventional clinical protocols.;The patient described her experience as transformative. She said the treatment not only relieved her physical pain, but also brought her happiness and renewed family ties. Inspired, she began studying flower alchemy and now applies the therapy to loved ones and her patients, promoting harmony and emotional healing at home and in the dental office.;Yes, it can be presented.;"Alchemical flower therapy; autoimmune dermatitis; integrative care; skin healing; "

According to modern perspective patient was consuming Methotrexate 15mg and omnacortil for more than12 years. Which underlines metabolic disturbances and hepatotoxicity.";Treatment was highly individualized including oral administration of a personalized Ayurvedic preparation of herbal powders and some standard Ancient Ayurvedic preparations such as Gandhak Rasayana, Panchatikta Guggulu Ghrita. The treatment started with Pachana, Pitta- Kaphaghna medications and after that Shodhana(Detox treatment) and finally Rasayana (Rejuvination). After 3 weeks, methotrexate was tapered and discontinued. Follow-up involved 10 days of Basti Karma using classical Shodhana and Rasayana formulations.;Marked improvement in skin lesions- cessation of Stravi Vrana (wounds become healthy with no discharge), restored mobility, improved appetite, and normalized lab markers (CRP, LFTs). The patient reported better psychological well-being and regained independence in walking. No adverse events were noted.;This case illustrates how individualized, Rasayana-based Ayurvedic treatment can offer a viable alternative for autoimmune disease management.Identifying underlying causes, assessment of Dosha and Vyadhi Awastha (Staging of disease) is always a key. It calls for broader clinical validation and integration of traditional approaches into global health systems, especially in chronic, refractory conditions.;The patient described her recovery as “unexpected and empowering.” She reported a renewed sense of vitality, improved appetite, and emotional relief from years of dependency on immunosuppressants. Regaining the ability to walk independently and experiencing visible skin healing gave her confidence in the holistic approach.;This case report pertains to a deceased patient.

There was clinical improvement from the patient, that presented reduced physical and psychological symptoms, as well as Energetic and Nursing Diagnosis. Optimized kidney function confirmed by laboratorial exams. This record can contribute with the current conservative treatment and the prorogation of future hemodialysis, safely, using acupuncture as a complementary treatment to the conventional one².
Limitations: emergence of new physical symptoms (patient’s fall) and non-alteration of psychological complaints, such as feeling helpless, distress (dementia, health risks, death, decreased functionalities) and fear. This proves the vulnerability of an elderly patient, with chronic disorders and challenging family dynamics. The psychic dimension needs more time to a professional/patient link and auto-perception. It’s necessary to develop an amplified view of the health-disease process and the global promotion of human care, especially self-care³. 
However, sadness was reduced, revealing that acupuncture reduces damage, solves problems and favors quality of life. Also, it’s extremely relevant in the context of preventive medicine, because energy renewal, aid in physical and emotional balance, and stimulus to self-care and self knowledge that change the perception of life, are other benefits associated with acupuncture4.
	Conclusion: the case study increased the patient’s quality of life, and keeping the continuous acupuncture sessions favors her conservative treatment of CDK. Acupuncture is a promotion of well-being5.
	Main lesson: clinical expertise gained by experiencing TCM contribution to a challenging reality of chronic disease and family dynamics. The possibility to prorogue future hemodialysis, safely, was a professional and personal accomplishment.

- March 1, 2022: Initiated Floral de Yana (10 drops, four times daily)
- March 2, 2022: PET/CT showed high uptake in adrenal (SUV 10.7) and pulmonary lesion (SUV 10.3)
- April 20, 2022: Started Ipilimumab + Nivolumab
- July 2022–March 2023: Imaging showed gradual regression and stabilization
- March 2024: Adrenalectomy revealed no residual tumor";Initial imaging revealed a voluminous adrenal lesion with contiguous invasion. PET/CT demonstrated intense metabolic activity, suggesting active metastasis. Differential diagnoses included adrenal carcinoma and recurrent melanoma. Given the tumor size and vascular involvement, surgery was not indicated. Histopathology post-adrenalectomy in 2024 revealed only an organized hematoma. The prognosis at onset was considered poor due to metastatic burden and lack of standard therapeutic options.;The patient initiated Floral de Yana, a vibrational therapy derived from the energetic signature of the Pleurotus genus. The remedy does not contain pharmacologically active compounds and was used with the goal of promoting systemic energetic harmonization. Immunotherapy with ipilimumab and nivolumab was initiated after 50 days, with no dosage changes. No additional oncologic therapies were administered during this period.;Imaging performed from July 2022 onward showed progressive tumor shrinkage and partial cavitation, with eventual lesion stabilization. No new metastases were identified. The adrenal mass, previously considered inoperable, was surgically removed in March 2024 and confirmed free of viable tumor. Treatment was well tolerated with no adverse events. Patient adherence remained consistent throughout the follow-up period.;"The early tumor response, prior to the full expected effect of immunotherapy, raises the hypothesis of a synergistic or immune-priming effect from the vibrational therapy.

No relevant genetic conditions were reported.;"Three months before consultation: bereavement and pain worsening.
First consultation: pain 10/10 (VAS), insomnia, and medication overuse.
Weeks 1–6: weekly integrative sessions.
Week 6: pain reduced to 3/10 (VAS), improved sleep, reduced medication use.";Physical examination revealed paravertebral muscle tension, multiple trigger points in the upper thoracic and cervical regions, and restricted cervical spine range of motion. No laboratory or imaging exams were requested due to clinical criteria and resource limitations. The diagnosis was chronic myofascial dorsalgia associated with emotional distress. Differential diagnoses considered included osteoarticular degeneration and neuropathic pain, deemed unlikely based on clinical presentation.;Weekly sessions combining NADA auriculotherapy protocol (Shen Men, Sympathetic, Kidney, Liver, Lung points) with dry needling in cervical and dorsal trigger points were performed over six weeks. Psychosocial support and health education complemented the approach.;Progressive pain reduction and improved sleep were noted. By the sixth week, the patient reported a decrease in pain to 3/10 (VAS), reduced use of benzodiazepines and analgesics, and improved emotional well-being. No adverse effects occurred, and the patient expressed satisfaction with her quality of life improvement.;"This case illustrates the feasibility, safety, and clinical benefits of integrating auriculotherapy and dry needling into public primary healthcare. These low-cost, evidence-based practices contributed to effective symptom control, medication reduction, and increased patient autonomy, reinforcing their value in overburdened public services.
Conclusion:
Integrative practices proved effective and accessible for managing chronic musculoskeletal pain in public primary care, promoting rational medication use and comprehensive patient care.";"""After several years with many medications, a lot of pain, depression and tired of looking for resources, give me back a life with practically no medication (Being seen as a human being cures any illness).
Blessed be auriculotherapy and those who know its effectiveness.
I thank Dr. Camila and Dr. Rafaela who started treating me with auriculotherapy. In less than two months, the pain almost disappeared and today I can do housework that I couldn't do before.";yes;"Auriculotherapy; Dry Needling; Chronic Pain; Primary Health Care; Integrative Medicine"

Sourced from the GWG Organic Research Station, the tea was home-administered. While papaya has been studied in Southeast Asia and India, this case adds to the limited clinical documentation from the Caribbean.  ;A previously healthy, national-level athlete, underwent routine blood testing on 23 June 2025. Initially asymptomatic, she subsequently developed a high fever. No relevant medical history, prior interventions, or physical exam findings were reported.;Thrombocytopenia was noted on 23rd June 2025. Papaya tea was started 24 June and continued for four days. On 27 June, platelets reached  235 × 10?/L.;Labs showed platelets at 98 x10?/L (150–400 x10?/L), white blood cell (WBC) count at 3.8 x10?/L (4.0–11.0 x10?/L), red cell distribution width (RDW) at 13.2% (11.5–14.5%), and a positive Dengue IgG. No diagnostic challenges were reported. Results suggested resolving post-dengue thrombocytopenia with favourable prognosis.;Papaya tea was prepared by boiling 2–4 g of dried leaves in 500 mL water and straining. Doses of 30–50 mL were given two to three times daily for 3-4 days. Prepared fresh each day, it was administered under parental supervision.;Platelets increased from 98 to 235 x10?/L and WBC count normalized from 3.8 to 6.8 x10?/L within four days. Follow-up results showed slight elevations in mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration (35.8 g/dL) and RDW (13.4%), likely training-related. Adherence and tolerability were confirmed by parental report, with no adverse events noted.;The strength of this case lies in the rapid platelet recovery observed in an active individual, though it is limited by its single-case design. Indian studies from 2016–2025, support the potential of papaya leaf tea to boost platelets. Phytochemicals in the tea may enhance thrombopoiesis post-dengue. While causality cannot be confirmed, the timeline and absence of co-interventions suggest a possible therapeutic effect. This case highlights the potential of this culturally relevant, plant-based remedy as an adjunct in dengue recovery. Papaya leaf tea may aid post dengue platelet recovery but should be used with medical oversight and evaluated through further study.;The patient experienced a high fever (>103°F) for three days, which began to subside by the fourth day and resolved by day six. She paused her training during this time to recover strength. Her mother, a health professional, reported that the family was aware of papaya leaf’s traditional use for dengue and chose to prepare the tea accordingly. The preparation was described as palatable and mild, not requiring sweetening. The patient noted that it resembled “a tea that one would drink in the night before bedtime.” No adverse effects were observed.;Informed consent was obtained from the patient’s mother for writing and presenting this case at the WCTCIM 2025 conference. Ethics approval was not sought, as this is a retrospective review with informed consent, pending confirmation from The University of the West Indies Ethics Committee.;"Dengue; thrombocytopenia; papaya leaf tea; platelet recovery; case report"

This novel integrative approach mitigated withdrawal symptoms and improved core fibromyalgia symptoms, adding to scientific literature on Erythrina mulungu's safety and efficacy in complex poly-symptomatic patients.;A 50-year-old postmenopausal woman presented with chronic anxiety, severe insomnia, and widespread fibromyalgia pain, significantly impacting her life. She had a five-year history of clonazepam (2 mg/day) and prior unsuccessful attempts at reduction. Validated assessments showed moderate anxiety (GAD-7: 12), moderately severe insomnia (ISI: 16), and moderate fibromyalgia impact (FIQ-R: 50).;Clonazepam (2 mg/day) initiated 5 years prior. Fibromyalgia diagnosed 3 years prior. At Month 0, clonazepam tapering began with Erythrina mulungu introduction. Clonazepam was gradually tapered (switching to liquid at Month 2). The Mulungu dose was carefully adjusted, with an increase at Month 3.5 during the final withdrawal phase to optimize symptom control, and a subsequent reduction in the morning dose to address daytime drowsiness. Clonazepam was completely discontinued at Month 4. Follow-up to Month 6 showed significant symptom improvements.;Diagnosis relied on DSM-5 criteria for Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Chronic Insomnia, and ACR 2010 criteria for Fibromyalgia. Validated patient-reported outcome measures (GAD-7, ISI, FIQ-R) were used at baseline and follow-up. No significant diagnostic challenges were encountered. Prognosis for benzodiazepine cessation was initially guarded but improved with Mulungu.;Intervention combined gradual clonazepam tapering (from 2 mg/day, transitioning to liquid) with titrated Erythrina mulungu tincture (1:5, Brazilian Pharmacopoeia). Initial Mulungu dose was 30 drops/day, adjusted to 45 drops/day during peak withdrawal,  and subsequently modified for tolerability by reducing the morning dose to minimize daytime drowsiness. Patient education was also provided.;Over six months, clonazepam was successfully discontinued. Significant improvements were observed: GAD-7 reduced from 12 to 5, ISI from 16 to 7, and FIQ-R from 50 to 15. The patient reported enhanced concentration, energy, reduced pain, and improved mood. Adherence was excellent, and Mulungu was well-tolerated, with transient drowsiness being the only adverse event, resolved by dose adjustment.;This case demonstrates Erythrina mulungu's role as a safe, effective adjunct in managing anxiety, insomnia, and fibromyalgia, particularly aiding benzodiazepine withdrawal. Strengths include detailed longitudinal follow-up and validated measures. Limitations include its single-patient nature, preventing generalization. Preclinical studies support Mulungu's anxiolytic, sedative, and analgesic properties. The case advocates for integrating TCIM for holistic chronic care.;"""For five years, clonazepam trapped me. Mulungu made a huge difference in tapering off. Despite tough days and some morning sleepiness, I'm now off clonazepam, sleeping better, anxiety is milder, and fibromyalgia pain is less. I have more energy, focus, and returned to hobbies. This natural option gave me my life back.""";Yes, informed consent was obtained from the patient for the treatment plan and for the publication of this case report.;"Erythrina mulungu; Anxiety; insomnia; Fibromyalgia; case report"

Down syndrome (DS) is a genetic condition caused by the presence of a third copy of chromosome 21 (Mustacchi, 2020). Children with DS, or trisomy 21 (T21), present unique dermatological and immunological characteristics that can affect the progression and severity of infections (Bull, 2011). Since HFMD has no specific antiviral treatment, this case report explores the topical use of geranium essential oil (GEO) and tea tree essential oil (TTEO) as a complementary approach in a child with DS.;According to the parents, the child had a history of atopic dermatitis, was clinically diagnosed with HFMD by the pediatrician, and Down syndrome was confirmed by karyotyping, revealing free trisomy 21. The 21-month-old male presented with typical lesions on the throat, hands, and feet, as well as legs, elbows, and diaper area, along with irritability, but without secondary infection. He remained afebrile and maintained good oral intake.;The aromatherapy protocol was initiated following the clinical diagnosis. Between days 3 and 5, progressive improvement was observed. By the seventh day, the lesions were nearly completely healed.;HFMD was clinically diagnosed based on typical findings. No laboratory or imaging tests were requested. The case progressed with a favorable prognosis.;A topical blend was prepared using 1 drop of TTEO (Melaleuca alternifolia, steam-distilled from the leaves), and 1 drop of GEO (Pelargonium graveolens, steam-distilled from the aerial parts), both were diluted in 10 mL of cold-pressed grapeseed carrier oil (Vitis vinifera), resulting in a 1% concentration. The formulation was applied topically to the lesions three times daily for ten days. No changes were made to the protocol.;The parents reported improvement in the lesions, including reduced erythema, decreased irritability, and improved sleep. The topical application was well tolerated, with no adverse events. Treatment adherence was complete, and overall well-being improved.;"In addition to DS-related features, a history of atopic dermatitis may have increased his susceptibility to more extensive viral skin involvement (Silverberg, 2003). While HFMD typically resolves spontaneously, aromatherapy may offer faster symptom relief and improved comfort. 
The blend followed pediatric safety, with 1% dilution appropriate for this age group (Tisserand & Young, 2014), and scientific evidence: geraniol in GEO showed in vitro antiviral activity against Coxsackievirus B1 (Mileva et al., 2015), while TTEO, although ineffective against Coxsackievirus B1 (Garozzo et al., 2009), was included for its antimicrobial potential (Shao et al., 2021). 
Clinical reports on HFMD in children with DS are limited, especially in the context of aromatherapy. Further studies are needed to better understand therapeutic responses in this population.";The parents found the blend easy and safe to apply, expressing confidence in aromatherapy as a complementary approach. An olfactory test was not conducted due to the child's young age.;The patient’s guardians provided informed consent for anonymous publication, in line with ethical guidelines.;"Hand Foot and Mouth Disease; Down syndrome; aromatherapy; Child"

Thus, disharmonies of the heart can manifest signs and symptoms such as chest tightness, cyanosis of the lips and nails, and fear of losing control,1 which can appear subtly during pregnancy ;P. V., 41 years old, businesswoman, pregnant, secundiparous, IVF pregnancy, with chronic hypertension, anxiety, and emotional trauma due to the loss of a previous pregnancy as a result of eclampsia. The patient was admitted to the hospital at 27 weeks' gestation to control her blood pressure and was prescribed antihypertensive drugs and anticoagulants. The aim was to help control blood pressure and anxiety in a pregnant woman using TCM. TCM was chosen by the multi-professional team and started twice a week using Systemic Acupuncture and Auriculotherapy. The acupuncturist trained the husband to perform bloodletting at the apex of the ears whenever the pressure rose above (130 X 80mmhg).;Acupuncture and auriculotherapy sessions with needles were associated with medical management, during the hospitalization of the pregnant woman, continuous medications were maintained. The resources of complementary medicine help in controlling blood pressure.;The evaluation of the semiology of the tongue and measurement of blood pressure measured were used as an instrument to measure the clinical conduct during the sessions.;The auriculotherapy acupoints with systemic needles used were: Shen Men, Kidney, Spleen-Pancreas, Heart, Hypothalamus and Neurasthenia. The systemic acupoints used during the sessions were: LV2, KI9, Yintang, LI11, HT7, LU9, PC6 and GV20. The treatment, using integrative practices, was carried out for 4 consecutive weeks in conjunction with allopathic treatment.  ;lthough the patient maintained a blood pressure of 170x100 mmhg several times a day, evolving into Eclampsia-Help Syndrome at 31 weeks' gestation, there was an improvement in blood flow, verified through the measurement of blood pressure and in the control of anxiety, through the patient's report and self-perception. These results were provided by MCT, which, although it doesn't rule out the causes, manages to minimize exacerbations, help the body, and balance it. In addition, it should be noted that the preterm birth was prolonged by 4 weeks, maintaining a controlled outcome for mother and baby, who had no neurological impairment in the postpartum period;Although there is still a small sample of studies, the results recommend the use of integrative and complementary practices, which can reduce stress and anxiety, thus helping to reduce blood pressure. We need to encourage the use of integrative and complementary practices to reduce blood pressure, one of the causes of maternal and infant mortality.;The patient reported that she controlled anxiety during the increase in blood pressure, when she was under the effect of acupuncture. The use of integrative and complementary practices helps to reduce stress, thus collaborating to reduce blood pressure. ;Yes, in a handwritten document.;"Pregnancy; Eclampsia; hypertension; Medicine Chinese Traditional"

The perimenopause period involves hormonal fluctuations that may cause hot flashes, fatigue, mood swings, and insomnia.
In TCM, this stage is seen as a natural decline of Jing (ancestral Qi), often resulting in Kidney Yin deficiency and relative Yang excess—a pattern referred to as “false fire”.  
While there is no direct herbal equivalent to the Western diagnosis of perimenopause, TCM offers some formulas to address symptom patterns. Liuwei Dihuang Wan is commonly used to nourish Kidney Yin and Liver and reduce internal heat. 
";A 46-year-old woman, during her perimenopausal phase, severe hot flashes, cold feet, fatigue, insomnia, irritability, poor concentration and itchy skin.  Cholecystectomy in 2017 and bariatric surgery in 2018, procedures that may contribute to Qi deficiency. Contraceptives use.;One year before consultation, she began experiencing fatigue, cold feet, and palpitations. Not menstruated for several years due to contraceptive, difficult to determine her menopausal status. Normal hormone levels, symptoms of perimenopause. Six months prior, reported increased irritability and insomnia with frequent nighttime awakenings.;"TCM uses tongue and pulse assessment as diagnostic tools. Through them we may identify alterations in the flow of Qi.
At first consultation, the tongue was swelling, indicating phlegm and Qi stagnation; teeth marks on the sides, supporting the pattern of dampness accumulation and Liver Qi stagnation; petechiae, indicating blood stasis; and scant coating with a slightly yellowish color, pointing to a pattern of Kidney Yin Deficiency and the presence of internal heat.
Weak and deep pulse on both sides, full in Spleen position, and tense in Liver the position: also indicates Qi Deficiency, with dampness accumulation and Liver Qi stagnation.
Diagnosis: ascension of false heat due to Kidney Yin Deficiency and Liver Qi Stagnation, with Spleen Deficiency—a pattern commonly in perimenopause.
";Prescribed Liuwei Dihuang Wan, 200 mg twice daily for 10 days. Increased to 200 mg three times daily for a total treatment period of 45 days.;"Initial in-person consultation, followed by weekly remote follow-ups. After 30 days, a new in-person assessment was conducted, followed by additional weekly remote contacts. The patient adhered to the treatment. The criteria for evaluating of perimenopause-related symptoms included the patient’s self-reports.
reported menstrual spotting, sign of improved blood circulation, recovery of Kidney Deficiency, and unobstructed flow of Liver.
After 45 days, extremities were warmer, suggesting possible improvement in Kidney Yin Deficiency. Also significant improvement in psychological symptoms, cognition and enhanced sleep quality. Benefits were maintained, with no adverse events.
";"For Lo Der-Chen (2008) Liuwei Dihuang formula regulates energetic imbalances seen during perimenopause. Although there is no specific Chinese herbal formula to the Western diagnoses of perimenopause, TCM offers herbal treatments to the symptoms reported by patients. 
Results were positive, although it was a single case. Broader studies are needed to validate TCM effectiveness for perimenopausal symptoms. Strengthening dialogue between TCM and Western medicine is crucial for advancing integrative care.
